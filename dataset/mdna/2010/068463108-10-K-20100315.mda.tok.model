item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide human resource management services  comprised principally of staffing services and peo services 
we generate staffing services revenues primarily from short term staffing  contract staffing  on site management and direct placement services 
our peo service fees are generated from contractual agreements with our peo clients under which we become a co employer of our client s workforce with responsibility for some or all of the client s human resource functions 
we recognize revenues from our staffing services for all amounts invoiced  including direct payroll  employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
peo service fee revenues are recognized on a net basis in accordance with current accounting guidance for revenue recognition and principal agent considerations 
consequently  our peo service fee revenues represent the gross margin generated from our peo services after deducting the amounts invoiced to peo customers for direct payroll expenses such as salaries  wages  health insurance and employee out of pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment 
these amounts are also excluded from cost of revenues 
peo service fees also include amounts invoiced to our clients for employer payroll related taxes and workers compensation coverage 
through centralized operations at our headquarters in vancouver  washington  we prepare invoices weekly for our staffing services customers and following the end of each payroll processing cycle for peo clients 
we invoice our customers and clients as each payroll is processed 
payment terms for staffing customers are generally days  while peo clients invoices are generally due on the invoice date 
our business is concentrated in california and oregon and we expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from these markets in the future 
revenues generated in our california and oregon offices accounted for of our total net revenues in  in and in consequently  any weakness in economic conditions or changes in the regulatory environments in these regions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we offer cash safety incentives to certain peo clients for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the cash incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the safety incentive expense is also netted against peo revenues on our statements of operations 
our cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs for staffing services  employer payroll related taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal and state unemployment taxes  and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs 
table of contents associated with our self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state administrative agency fees and excess insurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
we also maintain separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where we are not self insured 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to us  our respective independent tpa or our internal claims management personnel analyze the details of the injury and develop a case reserve  which becomes the estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and their professional judgment 
we then record or accrue an expense and a corresponding liability based upon our estimate of the ultimate claim cost 
as cash payments are made by our tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa and our in house claims administrators also review existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjust the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
our reserve includes a provision for both future anticipated increases in costs adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
this provision of the reserve is based upon an actuarial estimate provided by our third party actuary 
we believe our operational policies and internal claims reporting system help to limit the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  professional and legal fees and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive compensation 
depreciation and amortization represents depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets consisting of the amortization of software costs  covenants not to compete  and if material  customer related intangibles 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to years 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to ten years 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents self insured workers compensation reserves 
we are self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of our employee work sites in oregon  california  maryland  delaware and colorado and for staffing services and management employees only in washington 
the estimated liability for unsettled workers compensation claims represents our best estimate  which includes an evaluation of information provided by our internal claims adjusters and our third party claims administrators  coupled with management s use of a third party actuary 
these elements serve as the basis for our overall estimate for workers compensation claims liabilities  which include more specifically the following components case reserve estimates for reported losses  plus additional amounts for estimated future development of reported claims and incurred but not reported claims together ibnr 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments to liabilities are reflected in current operating results as they become known 
we believe that the amounts recorded for our estimated liabilities are reasonable and objective and are based upon facts and other trends associated with the company s historical universe of claims data 
nevertheless  it is possible that adjustments to such estimates may be required in future periods if the development of claim costs varies materially from our estimates and such adjustments  if necessary  could be material to results of operations 
safety incentives liability 
our accrued safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the liability is estimated and accrued each month based upon the then current amount of the customer s estimated workers compensation claims reserves as established by our internal claims adjusters and our third party administrators 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of goodwill indicates there was no impairment as of december  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
investments in marketable securities 
we consider available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments  including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
investments in securities classified as trading are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses reported in 
table of contents other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
in the event a loss on our available for sale investments is determined to be other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our statement of operations 
investments in securities classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
income taxes 
our income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach 
this requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the impact of uncertain tax positions would be recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge  if any  from taxing authorities 
as facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and would record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate in accordance with current accounting guidance for income taxes  which sets out the framework by which such judgments are to be made

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by selected items in the company s statements of operations for the years ended december   and  included in item of this report 
references to the notes to financial statements appearing below are to the notes to the company s financial statements included in item of this report 
percentage of total net revenues year ended december  revenues staffing services professional employer service fees total cost of revenues direct payroll costs payroll taxes and benefits workers compensation total gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization loss income from operations loss on impairment of investments other income pretax loss income benefit from provision for income taxes net loss income we report peo revenues in accordance with current accounting guidance for revenue recognition and principal agent considerations which requires us to report such revenues on a net basis because we are not the primary obligor for the services provided by our peo clients to their customers pursuant to our peo contracts 
we present for comparison purposes the gross revenues and cost of revenues information for the years ended december  and set forth in the table below 
although not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management 
table of contents believes this information is more informative as to the level of our business activity and more illustrative of how we manage our operations  including the preparation of our internal operating forecasts  because it presents our peo services on a basis comparable to our staffing services 
the presentation of revenues on a net basis and the relative contributions of staffing and peo revenues can create volatility in our gross margin percentage 
the general impact of fluctuations in our revenue mix is described below 
a relative increase in staffing revenues will typically result in a lower gross margin percentage 
staffing revenues are presented at gross with the related direct costs reported in cost of sales 
while staffing relationships typically have higher margins than peo relationships  an increase in staffing revenues and related costs presented at gross dilutes the impact of the net peo revenue on gross margin percentage 
a relative increase in peo revenue will result in higher gross margin percentage 
improvement in gross margin percentage occurs because incremental peo revenue dollars are reported as revenue net of all related direct costs 
in thousands year ended december  revenues staffing services professional employer services total revenues cost of revenues direct payroll costs payroll taxes and benefits workers compensation total cost of revenues gross margin a reconciliation of non gaap gross revenues to net revenues is as follows for the years ended december  and in thousands gross revenue reporting method reclassification net revenue reporting method revenues staffing services professional employer services total revenues cost of revenues the amount of the reclassification is comprised of direct payroll costs and safety incentives attributable to our peo client companies 

table of contents years ended december  and net loss for amounted to million  a decline of million from net income of million for the decline for was primarily due to lower revenues and lower gross margin dollars principally due to an million increase in workers compensation expense resulting from the company s change in estimate of its workers compensation reserves during the second quarter of diluted loss per share for was 
compared to a diluted earnings per share of 
for revenues for totaled million  a decrease of approximately million or  which reflects a decline in both the company s staffing service revenue and peo service fee revenue 
staffing service revenue decreased approximately million or from primarily due to a significant decline in demand for our staffing services from existing customers in the majority of our markets 
peo service fee revenue decreased approximately million or from primarily due to a decline in business as a result of decreased hours worked at our existing peo customer worksites  partially offset by the net effect of the addition of new customers 
during  the company served approximately  staffing service customers  which compares to  during management expects demand for the company s staffing services will continue to reflect overall uncertain economic conditions in its market areas 
during  the company served approximately  peo clients  which compares to approximately  peo clients during offsetting the increase in the number of peo clients served in was a decline in the average number of peo employees and worker hours per client 
net growth in the company s peo business has slowed due to general economic conditions 
gross margin for totaled approximately million  which represented a decrease of million or from  primarily due to the million additional workers compensation expense adjustment  a decline in revenues and higher payroll taxes and benefits as a percentage of revenues 
the gross margin percent decreased from of revenues for to for workers compensation expense  as a percent of revenues  increased from in to in workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for this increase was primarily due to the million additional workers compensation expense adjustment 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for  was principally due to higher statutory state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates in as compared to and to an increase in business mix of peo services where payroll taxes and benefits are presented at gross cost whereas the related direct payroll costs are netted against peo services revenue 
the decrease in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for reflects the moderate shift in the overall mix of services from staffing services to peo services in the company s customer base and the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
we expect gross margin as a percentage of total revenues to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as changes to our estimates for workers compensation claims liabilities  if necessary 
during the second quarter of  the company engaged a new actuary to review its workers compensation liabilities 
while the company historically obtained an actuarial study  management determined the study was not the best estimate of the workers 
table of contents compensation liability 
based upon discussions with the new actuary and a thorough review of the company s reserving process and consideration of recent developments  management determined the actuarial estimate as of june  was the best estimate of the ultimate cost to settle open claims 
our primary considerations included the significant erosion in the economy  the increasing complexity and uncertainty surrounding healthcare costs  unexpected development in open claims and growth in our business 
the change in estimate resulted in the company increasing its workers compensation claims liabilities by approximately million at june  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses relating to the operation of our headquarters and our branch offices and the marketing of our services 
sg a for amounted to approximately million  a decrease of million or from sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in the decrease in dollars from was primarily attributable to lower profit sharing and an overall reduction in variable operating expenses due to the decline in business activity and profitability 
during  the company recorded a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million relating to its investment in four closed end bond funds 
the impairment charge assumes no income tax benefit given the uncertainty of the company s ability to generate future taxable investment gains required to utilize these investment losses 
other income for was million compared to other income of million for the decline in other income for was primarily attributable to decreased investment income earned on the company s cash and investments due to a decline in investment yields  partially offset by a gain on the sale of certain corporate bonds of  depreciation and amortization totaled million for  which compares to million for the increase in the depreciation and amortization expense level compared to was primarily due to the incremental increase in depreciation related to a major software upgrade that was placed into service during our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the effective rate for was primarily attributable to the company s loss before income taxes coupled with higher federal and state tax credits 
at december   we had deferred income tax assets of million  which consist of temporary differences between taxable income for financial accounting and tax purposes  which will reduce taxable income in future years 
pursuant to gaap  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred income tax assets as significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during future periods 
although realization is not assured  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred income tax assets will be realized  principally based upon projected taxable income for the next two years 
the amount of the deferred income tax assets actually realized could vary  if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred income tax assets or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income as compared to operating forecasts 
if our operating forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to 
table of contents uncertain market conditions  our long term forecast may require reassessment 
as a result  in the future  a valuation allowance may be required to be established for all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets 
such a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
years ended december  and net income for amounted to million  a decline of or million from net income of million for the decline for was primarily due to lower gross margin dollars as a result of a decline in revenues and higher direct payroll costs and higher workers compensation expense  a million impairment charge on investments and higher sg a expenses 
diluted earnings per share for was 
compared to for revenues for totaled million  a decrease of approximately million or  which reflects a decline in the company s peo service fee revenue offset in part by an increase in staffing service revenue 
peo service fee revenue decreased approximately million or from primarily due to a decline in business with our existing peo customer base resulting from challenging economic conditions 
staffing service revenue increased approximately million or over primarily due to the acquisitions of strategic staffing on july   phillips temps on december  and first employment services on february  the increase was offset in part by a decline in business with existing or former customers in excess of market share gains attributable to new customers 
on a comparable branch office basis  ie without the benefit from the incremental revenue generated from the three acquisitions  staffing revenues for the year declined or approximately million due to a decrease in demand for staffing employees resulting from slower economic conditions in the company s markets 
during  the company served approximately  staffing service customers  which compares to a similar number of customers during during  the company served approximately  peo clients  which compares to approximately  peo clients during offsetting the increase in the number of peo clients served in was a decline in the average number of peo employees and worker hours per client 
gross margin for totaled approximately million  which represented a decrease of million or from  primarily due to the decline in revenues and higher cost of revenues 
the gross margin percent decreased from of revenues for to for the decline in the gross margin percentage was mainly due to higher direct payroll costs  expressed as a percent of revenues 
the increase in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for reflects the moderate shift in the overall mix of services from peo services to staffing services in the company s customer base primarily attributable to the acquisitions of strategic staffing  phillips temps and first employment services and the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
workers compensation expense  as a percent of revenues  increased from in to in workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for this increase was primarily due to higher estimates for new claim costs and to increases in estimates for existing claims in states where the company is self insured as well as to higher insurance premiums in states where the company is not self insured 
the small increase in payroll taxes and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for  was primarily due to the 
table of contents effect of growth in staffing services  as well as slightly higher effective state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates as compared to sg a for amounted to approximately million  an increase of million or over sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased from in to in the increase over was primarily attributable to increases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of the incremental sg a expenses associated with the strategic staffing  phillips temps and first employment services acquisitions  which represented million  offset in part by lower sg a expenses from our existing branch offices 
on a comparable branch basis  sg a expenses declined million primarily due to lower profit sharing 
during  the company recorded a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge of approximately million relating to its investment in four closed end bond funds 
other income for was million compared to other income of million for the decline in other income for was primarily attributable to decreased investment income earned on the company s cash and investments due to a decline in investment yields 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for  which compares to million for the increase in the depreciation and amortization expense level compared to was primarily due to the acquisitions of strategic staffing  phillips temps and first employment services 
our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the increase in the effective rate was primarily attributable to the company s establishment of a valuation allowance on the million impairment charge recognized on its investments  offset in part by state tax benefits attributable to associated insurance company for excess aice  our wholly owned captive insurance company  recognized upon the completion and filing of the company s state income tax returns during and to higher federal employment tax credits 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as seasonality  wage limits on statutory payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand for our services and competition and the effect of acquisitions 
payroll taxes  as a component of cost of revenues  generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and social security taxes are exceeded on a per employee basis 
our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers businesses in the agriculture  food processing and forest products related industries 
in addition  revenues in the fourth quarter may be affected by many customers practice of operating on holiday shortened schedules 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims 
in addition  adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the company s estimated workers compensation expense 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of million at december   decreased by million from december   which compares to an increase of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash at december   as compared to december   was primarily due to net loss of million  payment of cash dividends of million  the company s repurchase of its common stock of million and an increase of million in income taxes receivable  partially offset by a million increase in workers compensation claims liabilities 
the increase in cash at december  was primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and net income of million  offset in part by purchases of marketable securities of million and the company s repurchase of its common stock of million and cash used for acquisitions of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for amounted to million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for for  cash flow was primarily provided by an increase in workers compensation claims liabilities of million  partially offset by net loss of million  and an increase of million of income taxes receivable 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for for  the cash from investing activities was principally used in purchases of million of marketable securities  and purchase of property and equipment of  offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million 
the company presently has no material long term capital commitments 
net cash used in financing activities for was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for for  the principal uses of cash for financing activities were for the company s cash dividends of million paid to holders of the company s common stock  and the company s repurchase of  shares of its common stock for million  offset in part by  of tax benefits from exercises of stock options 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  the company acquired certain assets of first employment services  inc  a privately held staffing services company with offices in tempe and phoenix  arizona  effective february  as consideration for the acquisition  the company paid million in cash and agreed to pay additional consideration of million contingent upon the first months of financial performance 
management completed the evaluation of the financial performance criteria for the month period during the first quarter of and determined no additional consideration was due 
the company s business strategy continues to focus on growth through the expansion of operations at existing offices  together with the selective acquisition of additional personnel related business  both in its existing markets and other strategic geographic markets 
the company periodically evaluates proposals for various acquisition opportunities  but there can be no assurance that any additional transactions will be consummated 

table of contents the company entered into a new standby letter of credit agreement dated as of june  the credit agreement with its principal bank 
the credit agreement provides for standby letters of credit as to which there were million outstanding at december  in connection with various surety deposit requirements for workers compensation purposes 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company is required to maintain compliance with the following covenants to incur a net loss after taxes of no more than million for the year ended december  and maintain net income after taxes not less than one dollar on an annual basis thereafter  determined as of each fiscal year end  to maintain liquid assets defined as unencumbered cash  cash equivalents  and publicly traded and quoted marketable securities having an aggregate fair market value at all times not less than million  determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and to not borrow or permit to exist indebtedness other than from or to the bank  or mortgage  pledge  grant  or permit to exist a security interest in  or a lien upon  all or any portion of the company s assets now owned or hereafter acquired  except for purchase money indebtedness and related security interests which does not at any time exceed  the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the company is self insured for certain business insurance risks such as general liability  errors and omissions and umbrella coverage 
it is the company s determination that the risk of loss for such coverage is remote 
management may explore in the future more cost effective vehicles to provide higher limits of coverage  as well as coverages provided by the company s captive insurance company 
the company maintains a board authorized stock repurchase program to repurchase common shares from time to time in open market purchases 
during november  the board approved an increase in the total number of shares to be repurchased under the program up to a total of million common shares  up from the initial authorization of  shares 
in october  the board approved a second increase in the authorized shares to be repurchased up to million shares 
the repurchase program currently permits million of additional shares to be repurchased at december  management anticipates that the capital necessary to execute this program will be provided by existing cash balances and other available resources 
management expects that current liquid assets  coupled with the funds anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient in the aggregate to fund the company s working capital needs for the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december   including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and long term workers compensation liabilities and other long term liabilities are summarized below payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases long term workers compensation claims liabilities for catastrophic injuries other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations inflation inflation generally has not been a significant factor in the company s operations during the periods discussed above 
the company has taken into account the impact of escalating medical and other costs in establishing reserves for future expenses for self insured workers compensation claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to its investment portfolio of liquid assets 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted principally of approximately million in tax exempt money market funds  million in tax exempt municipal bonds with an average maturity of days  and approximately million in bond funds and corporate bonds 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio of liquid assets or its results of operations because of the predominantly short maturities of the securities within the investment portfolio
