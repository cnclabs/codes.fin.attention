item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pgi is a leading global provider of conferencing and collaboration solutions that enable companies and individuals to meet and collaborate in a more productive and efficient manner 
we have a global presence in countries in our three segments in north america  europe and asia pacific 
during the year ended december   we initiated a plan to divest our pgimarket business and completed its sale on november  prior period results in the following discussion and analysis have been reclassified to present this business as discontinued operations 
as a result  and except as provided herein  the following discussion and analysis reflects our results from continuing operations 
key highlights of our financial and strategic accomplishments for include generated net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million  decreased capital expenditures by from million in to million in  decreased our long term debt less cash and equivalents by from million at december  to million at december   and repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market 
our primary corporate objectives in are focused on continuing to develop and launch innovative products and customer self service tools that improve our user experience  transition our customers to more integrated  online collaboration solutions that provide a richer experience  and further establish our customer centric pgi brand to broaden our market presence  stengthen our customer relationships and differentiate us from our competitors 
specifically  in  our strategic plan includes our continued focus on our managed services model and our new collaboration platform to be launched later this year 
we believe both of these initiatives will significantly increase the addressable market opportunity for our solutions by integrating new technologies that are currently outside the conferencing industry as traditionally defined 
in  nearly of our consolidated net revenues were generated in countries outside the united states 
because we generate a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from our international operations  movements in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results 
we estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates during negatively impacted our consolidated net revenues by approximately million as compared to we have historically generated net revenue growth in our pgimeet solutions through increases in volume  offset in part by declines in average selling prices 
we believe that this is consistent with industry trends  which we expect will continue in the foreseeable future 
our business trends and revenue growth in our pgimeet solutions continue to be affected by the challenging economic climate  higher global unemployment and lower global business activity 
net revenue from our pgimeet solutions in   and were million  million  and million  respectively

net revenue from these services in  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
although we intend to continue to convert these customers to our alternative solutions  we expect this overall revenue decline to continue 
we have historically used our cash flows from operating activities for debt repayments  acquisitions  capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
as of december   borrowings under our credit facility were million 
we anticipate refinancing our existing credit facility in the first half of  prior to its scheduled maturity in april we currently expect pricing on this credit facility to be higher than our current level due to general credit market conditions 
in addition  we intend to continue to prudently invest in our pgimeet solutions  specifically in technology innovation and platform development  as well as new market strategies to better meet the needs of our large  global enterprise customers and to better attract  engage and acquire small and medium size business customers 
we currently anticipate an increase in selling and marketing expense in as compared to relating to the launch of our new meeting platform later this year

one of the swaps matured in august  and one swap remains outstanding at december  we did not initially designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and  as such  we did not account for them under hedge accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  we prospectively designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of our interest rate risk associated with our credit facility using the long haul method of effectiveness testing 
any changes in fair value prior to designation as a hedge and any ineffectiveness subsequent to such designation are recognized as unrealized gain loss on change in fair value of interest rate swaps as a component of other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations and amounted to million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
any changes in fair value that are determined to be effective are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and amounted to a gain of million  net of taxes  for the year ended december  we recognize the fair value of derivatives in our consolidated balance sheets as part of accrued expenses under current liabilities or long term liabilities depending on the maturity date of the contract 
the amount recognized in current liabilities was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amount recognized in long term liabilities was million at december  as of december   we have one million interest rate swap outstanding  which has a fixed rate of and expires in august liquidity as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we generated positive operating cash flows from each of our geographic business segments for the year ended december  each geographic business segment had sufficient cash flows from operations to service existing debt obligations  to fund capital expenditure requirements  which have historically been to of annual consolidated net revenues  and to fund research and development costs for new services and enhancements to existing services  which have historically been to of annual consolidated net revenues 
assuming no material change to these costs  which we do not anticipate  we believe that we will generate adequate operating cash flows for capital expenditures and contractual commitments and to satisfy our indebtedness and fund our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
at december   we had million of available credit on our existing million credit facility  without regard to the uncommitted million of the accordion feature 
during  net borrowings on our credit facility of million resulted primarily from our self tender offer and stock repurchases in the open market 
we have historically used our cash flows from operations for debt repayments  acquisitions  capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
at december   borrowings under our credit facility were million 
in  we anticipate continuing to use our cash flows to pay down our debt  while still continuing to be optimistic in possible acquisitions and share repurchases 
we regularly review our capital structure and evaluate potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets  cash flows from our operating segments and other factors  we may engage in other capital transactions 
these capital transactions include  but are not limited to  debt or equity issuances or credit facilities with banking institutions 
we anticipate refinancing our existing credit facility in the first half of  prior to its maturity in april critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  legal contingencies and derivative instruments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues consist primarily of usage fees generally based on per minute  per fax page or per transaction methods 
to a lesser extent  we charge subscription fees and have fixed period minimum revenue commitments 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue that results from non calendar month billing cycles and the one month lag time in billing related to certain of our services 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable prior to the recognition of revenue  we make a decision that collectability is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment terms and other trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets and long lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment review 
we completed these reviews as of december   and with no impairments identified 
we did recognize an impairment of our goodwill during associated with the sale of our pgimarket business 
see discontinued operations 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized 
we recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
we recorded asset impairments related to other intangible assets during and see asset impairments and discontinued operations 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause us to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves significant management judgment in estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
our net deferred tax asset as of december  was million and our net deferred tax liability as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded our valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and capital loss carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reverse an existing valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december  and was million and million  respectively  all of which  if recognized  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
we also have reserves for certain asserted international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to inquiries from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated income taxes to be paid in future periods 
we believe we have appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
restructuring costs restructuring accruals are based on certain estimates and judgments related to severance and exit costs  contractual lease obligations and related costs 
our estimated severance costs could be impacted if actual severance payments are different from initial estimates 
contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain litigation matters as disclosed in item legal proceedings of this annual report 
we accrue an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of legal claims 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
our estimates are subject to change  and we adjust the financial impact in the period in which such matters are resolved 
derivative instruments we have entered into interest rate swaps that are classified as derivatives with the intention of hedging the cash flow risk of variable one month libor interest rate changes on the interest payments associated with our credit facility 
we did not initially designate these interest rate swaps as hedges and  as such  we did not account for them under hedge accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  we prospectively designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges using the long haul method of effectiveness testing 
any changes in fair value prior to designation as a hedge and any ineffectiveness subsequent to such designation are recognized as unrealized gain loss on change in fair value of interest rate swaps as a component of other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations throughout the contract periods 
any changes in fair value that are determined to be effective are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of derivatives is recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as accrued expenses under current liabilities or long term liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and the timing of intercompany payable settlements 
in addition  from time to time  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk of interest rate changes associated with our credit facility 
at december   our interest rate swap effectively converted the interest payments of million of our libor based borrowings to a fixed rate 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our credit facility that are subject to interest rate risk 
each basis point increase in interest rates relative to these borrowings would impact our annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million based on our december  debt level 
we generated of our consolidated net revenues and of our operating expenses in countries outside of the united states in additionally  we have foreign currency denominated debt as part of our credit facility 
at december   we had debt outstanding of ca million 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported consolidated net revenues  operating income and debt 
a hypothetical positive or negative change of in foreign currency exchange rates would positively or negatively change our consolidated net revenues for by approximately million  operating expenses for by approximately million and outstanding debt by million 
our principal exposure has been related to local currency sales and operating costs in australia  canada  the euro zone  japan  norway and the united kingdom 
we have not used derivatives to manage foreign currency exchange risk  and we did not have any foreign currency exchange derivatives outstanding at december
