item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a  part i  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
we do not guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this document to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
overview revenues decreased to million in compared to million as uncertainty in the world economic environment impacted demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment 
consequently  gross margin decreased to in compared to in as certain fixed overhead costs were not recovered 
however  in the second half of  we saw mild  but continued  recovery in the semiconductor market as our revenues steadily increased from a low of million in the first quarter of  to million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
our focus on controlling costs resulted in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or to million in compared to million in despite the decreases in revenue and gross margin in compared to  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by only million to million at december  from million at december  while it is unclear when semiconductor and semiconductor equipment market conditions will return to the levels seen in and early  we believe that the market is recovering and that our competitive position  products  technology and balance sheet remain strong 
outlook for on january   we completed the acquisition of suss test  our primary competitor in the systems business 
the acquisition of suss test provides us with an expanded portfolio of products and should allow us to leverage the resources and core competencies of the combined companies in engineering and technology to address complex  emerging technologies 
we believe that the acquisition of suss test combined with ongoing recovery in the market for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will result in increased revenue for compared to based on our current backlog  anticipated bookings and expected incremental revenue from the acquisition of suss test  we anticipate revenues will be in the range of million to million for the first quarter of

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report on form k for additional information 
revenue revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in systems revenue in systems decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in 
table of contents certain financial information which contributed to the systems revenue results was as follows compared to compared to percentage decrease in unit sales percentage decrease in average sales price we realized decreased unit sales in both our mm systems and our non mm systems in compared to and in compared to due to the global slow down in semiconductor markets 
average sales price was negatively affected in compared to and in compared to by changes in our sales mix  as fewer high end mm systems were sold in relation to total system sales 
sales of mm systems represented  and of total units sales in  and  respectively 
average sales price includes the sales price of any analytical probes  probe cards and accessories purchased with an engineering probe station 
probes and sockets revenue in probes and sockets decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of lower unit sales driven by the overall decrease in worldwide semiconductor production 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to new product introductions  new design wins in the rf and wireless market and continued focus on growth in market segments and applications other than our core rf business  especially in the parametric test market 
parametric test is the electrical verification of the wafer fabrication process quality and is used by semiconductor wafer fabs world wide 
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales includes purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test  installation labor  overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties and provision for inventory valuation reserves 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the decreases in cost of sales were primarily due to the decreases in sales  partially offset by lower gross margins 
systems the gross margin in systems decreased to in compared to in  primarily attributable to the overall decrease in sales volume and change in product mix 
we sold fewer mm systems in relation to total system sales  which typically yield higher margins than non mm systems due to their higher average sales prices and sales of accessories 
the decrease in gross margin due to volume and product mix were partially offset by decreases in salaries  benefits and overhead costs 
the gross margin in systems decreased to in from in  primarily due to the overall decrease in unit sales as unallocated fixed overhead costs and inventory reserve charges were recorded as a period expense in cost of sales 
in addition  there was a shift in sales product mix to fewer mm systems  which typically yield higher gross margins and include more accessories 

table of contents probes and sockets the gross margin in probes and sockets decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to the decrease in sales volume as production costs for probes and sockets have a higher component of fixed overhead than systems 
as sales volumes decline  unallocated fixed overhead costs recorded as a period expense in cost of sales increase 
the impact of the decline in sales volume was partially offset by an overall reduction in salaries  benefits and overhead costs and improvement in yields on certain product lines 
the gross margin in probes and sockets decreased to in from in  primarily due to lower than expected sales and production volume in the fourth quarter of  as unallocated fixed overhead costs were recorded as a period expense in cost of sales 
the decrease in fourth quarter production volume was partially offset by a gross margin in probes and sockets of through the first three quarters of as efficiencies were achieved with the higher production volumes in those quarters 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials  consultants and overhead 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and decreased million  or  in compared to million in the decreases were due to the following compared to decrease in wages and benefits due to lower headcount increase in consulting fees for r d projects decrease in severance costs decrease in travel  meals and entertainment expenses decrease in allocated occupancy expenses decrease in recruiting expenses decrease in stock based compensation other  net compared to decrease in wages and benefits due to lower headcount decrease in production costs allocated to r d increase in travel expenses increase in recruiting expenses other  net selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes compensation and related expenses for personnel  travel  outside services  manufacturers representative commissions  internally developed patent and trademark amortization and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions  as well as costs to operate as a public company 

table of contents sg a expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the changes were due to the following compared to decrease in wages and benefits due to lower headcount decrease in accounting and consulting fees decrease in internal and external sales commissions decrease in travel  meals and entertainment expenses decrease in recruiting and relocation expenses decrease in advertising  sales materials and event fees decrease in stock based compensation increase in legal expenses decrease in freight and postage expenses decrease in severance and restructuring costs decrease in allocated occupancy expenses decrease in executive incentive compensation decrease in equipment repairs and maintenance decrease in departmental supplies decrease in loss on disposals of long lived assets decrease in bad debt expense other  net compared to decrease in external sales commissions increase in accounting fees increase in stock based compensation expense increase in bad debt expense increase in severance costs increase in loss on disposals of long lived assets increase in travel expenses increase in temporary services and consulting fees other  net amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization related to our prior acquisitions 
amortization expense decreased million to million in compared to million in and increased million in compared million in the decrease in compared to was due to the asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of net purchased intangibles totaled million at december  asset impairment asset impairment charges included the following in thousands year ended december  goodwill purchased intangible assets patents during the fourth quarter of  the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment markets continued to deteriorate and the trading price of our common stock declined significantly 
based on these factors  our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that the implied fair value of our identified reporting units was less than the carrying value of goodwill at december  we also tested long lived assets for impairment  which indicated that the fair value of certain long lived assets 
table of contents were less than carrying value as of december  accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
other income expense other income expense typically includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense can also include other miscellaneous non operating gains and losses 
other income expense  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  interest income  net foreign currency gains losses gains losses on foreign currency forward contracts other interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates on investments 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances due to the use of million  net of cash acquired  for the purchase of gryphics  inc in april and the purchase of certain assets of synatron gmbh in july in addition  interest rates were lower in compared to foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from a combination of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the net value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in yen  euro and other foreign currencies 
included an adjustment for foreign currency re measurement related to  which increased other income in by million 
income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes totaled million  or of loss before income taxes  in  million  or of loss before income taxes  in and million  or of income before income taxes  in generally  the provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates and changes in tax reserves 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our provision for income tax expense benefit based on our projected results of operations for the full year and record an adjustment in the current quarter 
the income tax benefit for was primarily attributable to a tax relief act signed into law during the fourth quarter of that increased the carryback of our net operating losses from to years 
the million increase in income taxes receivable to million at december   compared to million at december   was a result of the income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of we continued to record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets generated from our net loss in the income tax benefit in differs from the statutory rate due to losses not benefited in certain tax jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the full reserve we recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets and the goodwill write off  which was not deductable for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate differed from federal statutory rates primarily due to benefits from research and experimental tax credits and non taxable income for federal tax purposes  offset by non deductible stock based compensation  increases to tax expense related to additions to tax contingencies recorded during the year and an out of period tax adjustment related to inter company sales and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities in was  and consisted of our net loss of million  offset by net non cash expenses of million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable  net decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in collection efforts during inventories decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in inventory was primarily attributable to a decrease in finished goods and demo equipment of million  a decrease in raw materials of million and an increase in inventory related reserves of million 
we believe that our inventory reserves at december  are adequate 
however  if our actual results are significantly different than our current expectations for  we may be required to increase reserves for inventory in future periods 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  primarily due to an overall decrease in accrued compensation and benefits  inventory purchases and operating expenses 
fixed asset purchases of million in were primarily for socket production related equipment and sustaining on going capital requirements 
we anticipate fixed asset additions for of approximately million  primarily for production related equipment  research and development tools and information technology 
assets held for sale at december  were sold for  in the first quarter of the loss of  upon sale of these assets was included as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million represented the sale of stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise price of options exercised pursuant to our stock incentive plan 
we anticipate meeting our cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future from existing cash  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities  which totaled million at december  in january  we utilized million of cash and cash equivalents for the purchase of suss test 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisition and expansion and any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our cash and marketable securities 
seasonality typically  our revenue is lower in our fiscal first quarter than in our fiscal fourth quarter preceding it 
in addition  as is typical in our industry  we recognize a large percentage of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter 
however  our seasonality can be affected by general economic trends and it should not be expected that historical revenue patterns will continue 

table of contents contractual commitments the following is a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases capital leases purchase order commitments forward contracts purchase order commitments primarily represent open orders for inventory 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have become increasingly difficult to make in the current economic environment 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
it is possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers that do not have acceptance criteria  including product sales to distributors  is recognized when a written purchase order has been obtained  the product is shipped  title has transferred  no obligations remain and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship our products with ex works terms 
for any shipments with destination terms  we defer revenue until delivery to the customer 
revenue from customers who have acceptance criteria beyond our standard terms and conditions is deferred until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
revenue for installation services  consisting of assembly and testing  and for systems shipped to integrators is also deferred 
deferred revenue related to service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract  typically one to two years 
deferred revenue for systems shipped to integrators is recognized upon shipment to the final customer 
our transactions may involve the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated based on the fair value of each element 
a typical multiple element arrangement may include some or all of the following components products  accessories  installation services and extended warranty contracts 
the total sales price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component when sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection history and known trends with current customers 
our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels  associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in collectability 
the current economic environment has increased both the risk of bad debt and the difficulty in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million  primarily for the specific reserve of receivables from one customer 
in  we had specific charges to the bad debt reserve of  and recoveries of previously reserved accounts of  valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we regularly analyze the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements 
table of contents and new product introductions 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost  computed on a first in  first out basis  or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a supply of parts for use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher write down against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it will be used 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
inventory write downs are recorded quarterly as a component of cost of sales 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including our intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of discounted future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
during  based on the results of our testing  we recorded impairment charges of million against purchased intangible assets and million against patents 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we did not record any impairment charges for long lived assets during or warranty liabilities warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
we estimate a liability for costs to repair or replace products under warranties ranging from days to one year and technical support costs when the related product revenue is recognized 
the products are sold without a right of return or price protection rights 
the liability for product warranties is calculated as a percentage of sales 
the percentage is based on historical actual product repair costs 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and actual warranty costs fluctuate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets for the estimated future benefit of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences to the extent management believes these assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recorded when management can not reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on this evaluation  in  we recorded a million charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets  and increased the valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets by  we continued to record a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets in the valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   we had net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to foreign jurisdictions 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the benefits of tax return positions in our financial statements if we determine that the positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as tax expense within our financial statements 
at december   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of  all unrecognized tax benefits would have an impact on the effective tax rate if recognized 
the interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were insignificant 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a discussion of accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sometimes attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts 
the purpose of these activities is to reduce the risk that future cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in some cases  we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  to hedge specific receivables 
as of december   we had contracts outstanding for the purchase of japanese yen totaling approximately million  which mature through june we also had one contract outstanding for the sale of euro that totaled approximately million and matured in january historically  we have not attempted to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of our subsidiaries net assets and results of operations  nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  accordingly  gains and losses on our forward exchange contracts are recognized currently as a component of other income expense 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million and long term marketable securities of million  which consisted of floating rate corporate obligations 
based on the nature of our marketable securities  a decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income  but would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have classified our securities as available for sale and  therefore  may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the market occur 
a decrease in interest rates of one percent would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million  assuming our december  balances remained constant 
in addition  due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents
