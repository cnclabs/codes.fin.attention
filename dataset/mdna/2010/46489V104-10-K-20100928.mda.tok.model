item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates past judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  accrued liabilities  and contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
short term investments the company invests certain excess cash in marketable securities consisting primarily of commercial paper  auction rate securities  certificates of deposit  and money market funds 
the company classifies all debt securities as available for sale and records the debt securities at fair value with unrealized gains and temporary unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity  if material 
any declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments the accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  of the financial accounting standards board fasb  permits  but does not require  entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items not specifically identified in other topics of the asc  such as available for sale investments  at fair value 
we have not elected to measure additional assets and liabilities at fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
a three level valuation hierarchy is used to qualify fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative financial instruments actively traded on exchanges  as well as us treasury securities and us government and agency mortgage backed securities that are actively traded in highly liquid over the counter markets 
level model inputs are observable inputs  other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs that are observable or can be corroborated  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level assets and liabilities include debt instruments that are traded less frequently than exchange traded securities and derivative instruments  for which the model inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market observable data 
examples in this category are less frequently traded mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities and derivative contracts 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable but significant to the fair value measurement 
examples in this category include interests in loans held for sale  certain securitized financial assets or certain private equity investments 
fair value is applied to eligible assets based on quoted market prices  where available 
for financial instruments for which quotes from recent exchange transactions are not available  fair value is based on discounted cash flow analysis and comparisons to similar instruments 
discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates 
the methods used for current fair value calculations of level and level assets and liabilities may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
if readily determined market values became available  or if actual performance were to vary appreciably from assumptions used  assumptions may need to be adjusted  which could result in material differences from the recorded carrying amounts 
we believe our methods of determining fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants 
however  the use of different methodologies or application of different assumptions to value certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value 
effective july   the company implemented asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  of the financial accounting standards board fasb  asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company elected to implement this standard with the one year deferral permitted for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value  except those that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis 
this deferral applied to fixed assets and intangible asset impairment testing and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations for which fair value is used 
the company does not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements when we implement asc for these assets and liabilities 
asc requires disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement 
level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly through market corroborated inputs 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants 
at june   all of the company s financial assets and liabilities are accounted and reported at fair value using level inputs 
also effective july   the company adopted asc topic  financial instruments 
the statement allows entities to value many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
asc provides guidance over the election of the fair value option  including the timing of the election and specific items eligible for the fair value accounting 
if the fair value option is elected then unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the company elected not to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value as of july  in accordance with asc accordingly  the adoption of asc did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
the company did elect to fair value its ars rights that were received in october and exercised in january in accordance with asc accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management of the company expects to collect from outstanding balances 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on management s judgment  considering historical write offs  collections and current credit conditions 
balances which remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a credit to the applicable accounts receivable 
payments received subsequent to the time that an account is written off are considered bad debt recoveries 
inventory inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market 
cost of raw materials is determined using the weighted average method 
cost of work in process and finished goods is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
fixed assets fixed assets are capitalized and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives production equipment to years office equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years leasehold improvements and capital lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset 
management of the company periodically reviews the net carrying value of all of its equipment on an asset by asset basis 
these reviews consider the net realizable value of each asset to determine whether an impairment of value has occurred  and if there is a need for any asset impairment write down 
although management has made its best estimate of the factors that affect the carrying value based on current conditions  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from its assets  and necessitate asset impairment write downs 
deferred financing costs financing costs related to the acquisition of debt are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method 
deferred financing costs include the fair value of common shares issued to certain shareholders for their guarantee of certain company debt in accordance with asc capitalization of interest and asc statement of cash flows 
the value of the shares issued was the estimated market price of the shares as of the date of issuance 
amortization of deferred financing costs  totaling  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  is included in financing expense on the statements of operations 
licenses amortization of licenses is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
during fiscal year  the company determined that the entire remaining value of the ibt license was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of  that is included in cost of product sales for the year ended june  see footnote to the audited consolidated financial statements amortization of licenses was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
based on the licenses recorded at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for  for all years thereafter 
other assets other assets  which include deferred charges and patents  are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization of patents is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying values of patents and other assets 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows to be derived from such assets are less than their carrying value 
amortization of other assets was  and  for the years ended june  and respectively 
based on the patents and other intangible assets recorded in other assets at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for each year through and  thereafter 
asset retirement obligation the fair value of the future retirement costs of the company s leased assets are recorded as a liability on a discounted basis when they are incurred and an equivalent amount is capitalized to property and equipment 
the initial recorded obligation is discounted using the company s credit adjusted risk free rate and is reviewed periodically for changes in the estimated future costs underlying the obligation 
the company amortizes the initial amount capitalized to property and equipment and recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the estimated remaining useful life of the leased assets 
in september  an asset retirement obligation of  was established representing the discounted cost of the company s estimate of the obligations to remove any residual radioactive materials and all leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term at its new production facility 
the estimate was developed by qualified production personnel and the general contractor of the new facility 
the company has reviewed the estimate again based on its experience with decommissioning its old facility and believes that the original estimate continues to be applicable 
during the years ended june  and  the asset retirement obligations changed as follows beginning balance accretion of discount ending balance because the company does not expect to incur any expenses related to its asset retirement obligations in fiscal year  the entire balance as of june  is classified as a noncurrent liability 
financial instruments the company discloses the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities  recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet  for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than a forced liquidation sale 
the carrying amounts of financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  notes payable  and capital lease obligations  approximated their fair values at june  and revenue recognition the company applies the provisions of asc topic  revenue recognition 
asc provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for the disclosure of revenue recognition policies 
the company recognizes revenue related to product sales when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and was derived primarily from sales of the proxcelan cs brachytherapy seed  which is used in the treatment of cancer 
the company recognizes revenue once the product has been shipped to the customer 
prepayments  if any  received from customers prior to the time that products are shipped are recorded as deferred revenue 
in these cases  when the related products are shipped  the amount recorded as deferred revenue is then recognized as revenue 
the company accrues for sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
although the company does not have an extensive operating history upon which to develop sales returns estimates  we have used the expertise of our management team  particularly those with extensive industry experience and knowledge  to develop a proper methodology 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes expense for all share based payments at fair value 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate fair value for all stock options on the date of grant 
for stock options that vest over time  the company recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
research and development costs research and development costs  including salaries  research materials  administrative expenses and contractor fees  are charged to operations as incurred 
the cost of equipment used in research and development activities which has alternative uses is capitalized as part of fixed assets and not treated as an expense in the period acquired 
depreciation of capitalized equipment used to perform research and development is classified as research and development expense in the year recognized 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  patent rights  environmental matters  and a variety of other matters 
the company is also subject to various local  state  and federal environmental regulations and laws due to the isotopes used to produce the company s product 
as part of normal operations  amounts are expended to ensure that the company is in compliance with these laws and regulations 
while there have been no reportable incidents or compliance issues  the company believes that if it relocates its current production facilities then certain decommissioning expenses will be incurred and has recorded an asset retirement obligation for these expenses 
the company records contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  the company does not believe any probable legal proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
under this method  the company provides deferred income taxes for temporary differences that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years based on the reporting of certain costs in different periods for financial statement and income tax purposes 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment of the change 
management has determined that the company  its subsidiary  and its predecessors are subject to examination of their income tax filings in the united states and state jurisdictions for the through tax years 
in the event that the company is assessed penalties and or interest  penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense 
income loss per common share basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  and does not include the impact of any potentially dilutive common stock equivalents  including preferred stock  common stock warrants or options that are potentially convertible into common stock as those would be antidilutive due to the company s net loss position 
securities that could be dilutive in the future as of june  and are as follows preferred stock common stock warrants common stock options total potential dilutive securities subsequent events effective april   the company adopted asc subsequent events 
this statement establishes the accounting for  and disclosure of  material events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued 
in general  these events will be recognized if the condition existed at the date of the balance sheet  and will not be recognized if the condition did not exist at the balance sheet date 
disclosure is required for non recognized events if required to keep the financial statements from being misleading 
the guidance in this statement is very similar to current guidance provided in accounting literature and  therefore  will not result in significant changes in practice 
subsequent events have been evaluated through the date our financial statements were issued the filing time and date of our annual report on form k 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates and affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
results of operations financial presentation the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations for the two years ended june  and this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors  beginning on page of this annual report on form k 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  product sales 
the company generated revenue of  for the year ended june  compared to revenue of  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or 
the total number of cases for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  declined 
revenue generated from prostate cancer related therapy amounted to approximately of revenue in the year ended june  while the remaining approximately is from new treatment modalities including lung  colorectal  head and neck and chest wall cancers 
in the year ended june  nearly of revenue was generated by prostate cancer therapy 
management believes that the overall market for prostate brachytherapy has received increased pressure from other treatment options with higher reimbursement rates such as intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt and management is focused on new treatment modalities to become a larger portion of the total revenue in the future 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was  for the year ended june  compared to cost of product sales of  for the year ended june  while the company continues to streamline manufacturing processes  the reduction of cost of product sales of  or for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june   was substantially impacted by a one time impairment charge of  the remaining year to year cost reduction of  was composed of decreases in depreciation and amortization expense of  occupancy expense of  payroll and benefits expense of  and pre loading expense of  the company achieved a  reduction in production costs as a result of a continued focus on analyzing and improving all aspects of production operations 
these continued efforts during fiscal year have resulted in improved production processes  better utilization of labor  ability to utilize company personnel in lieu of consultants and the continued increased use of internal seed loading capabilities by customers instead of external third party seed loading services 
gross margin loss 
gross margin was  for the year ended june  compared to a gross loss of  for the year ended june  the improvement of  or was due to the one time impairment charge in the year ended june  as well as continued reductions in production costs and more efficient use of manufacturing resources in the year ended june  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  were  which represents a decrease of  or approximately less than the research and development expenses of  for the year ended june  the cost savings of approximately  were primarily due to a  reduction in protocol expense as the major cost for the monotherapy protocol has been completed  consulting costs of  as several production projects were completed  legal costs were reduced by  and savings of  in payroll and benefits  related taxes and share based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  for the year ended june  compared to sales and marketing expenses of  for the year ended june   which represents a decrease of  or 
the decrease of approximately  is primarily the net result of a reduction in wages  benefits  related taxes and share based compensation of  that is related to both temporary and permanent attrition as well as forfeiture of related equity stock options  a decrease of  in travel that is a result of both the temporary attrition and improved trip planning  and a reduction of  in marketing and advertising expense through reducing the number of trade journals that were used for advertising 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were  compared to general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended june  the decrease of approximately  is primarily the net result of reductions in wages  benefits  related taxes and share based compensation of  reduction in legal expense of  and a decrease in consulting expenses of  that was partially offset by an increase in audit  sarbanes oxley act related compliance and tax expense of  operating loss 
in the year ended june   the company had an operating loss of  compared to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or 
the company s operating loss reduction of approximately million was achieved through savings in cost of product sales of million including a one time impairment charge of  research and development of  sales and marketing of  and general and administrative of  interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to interest income of  for the year ended june  the decrease of  or is the result of lower average cash and short term investment balances during the year ended june  and decreased interest rates 
gain on the fair value of short term investments 
there was no gain on short term investments for the year ended june  as compared to a gain of  for the year ended june  the gain of  for the year ended june  was due to the receipt of the company s rights related to its auction rate securities ars issued by its broker in october the gain was calculated as the fair value amount of the put rights as estimated on the date of receipt plus the changes in their fair value offset by additional realized losses on the company s ars 
financing and interest expense 
financing and interest expense for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or 
financing expense included interest expense of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to the lower than average debt balances in the year ended june  the remaining balance of financing expense represents the amortization of deferred financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources 
we have historically financed our operations through the sale of common stock and related warrants 
during fiscal year  the company primarily used existing cash reserves to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of approximately million 
cash used by operating activities is net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the reduction of net cash used by operating activities of million is attributable to the reduction of the company s net loss of million with an offsetting reduction in non cash charges of  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and a reduction of  in operating assets and liabilities in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year cash flows from investing activities cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  cash expenditures for fixed assets were approximately  in fiscal year and approximately  in fiscal year the short term investments of the company matured in the year ended june  and provided million of cash proceeds 
the company sold its remaining auction rate securities in january which generated million of cash proceeds 
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  and was used mainly for payments of debt  capital leases and the cash payment of stock offering costs 
projected liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and cash equivalents amounted to  with no short term investments compared to  of cash and cash equivalents and  of short term investments at june  the company had approximately million of cash as of september  as of that date management believed that the company s monthly required cash operating expenditures were approximately  which represents a significant decrease of approximately  from average monthly cash operating expenditures in fiscal year management believes that less than  will be spent on capital expenditures for the entire fiscal year  but there is no assurance that unanticipated needs for capital equipment may not arise 
the company s loan with the benton franklin economic development district matured and was paid during the fiscal year ended june  the company has only one remaining loan facility outstanding with the hanford area economic investment fund committee haeifc  with a principal balance of approximately  as of june  during fiscal year  the company intends to continue its existing protocol studies and begin new protocol studies on lung cancer treatment using cs currently  the company has budgeted approximately  in fiscal year for protocol expenses relating to lung cancer as well as continued work on the dual therapy and mono therapy prostate protocols 
based on the foregoing assumptions  management believes cash and cash equivalents on hand at june  should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements through january  management plans to attain breakeven and generate additional cash flows by increasing revenues from both new and existing customers through our direct sales channels and through our distributors  expanding into other market applications which initially will include head and neck implants  colorectal and lung implants while maintaining the company s focus on cost control 
management believes the company will reach breakeven with revenues of approximately  per month with cashflow breakeven from operations being reached at approximately  however  there can be no assurance that the company will attain profitability or that the company will be able to attain its revenue targets 
sales in the prostate market have not shown the increases necessary to breakeven during the past two fiscal years and did not improve during the year ended june  as management is now focused on expanding into head and neck  colorectal  lung and brain applications  management believes the company will need to raise additional capital for protocols  marketing staff  production staff and production equipment as it attempts to gain market share 
initially  management plans to seek to sell common stock pursuant to either an at the market offering or through a direct registered offering at a discount to the market price of not more than and has an effective form s shelf offering registration statement available for this purpose 
management executed a sales agreement with ck cooper company  inc ckcc on april  to sell shares as the company s sales agent at market prices  which was amended on july  as amended  the sales agreement expires on december  if the shares are sold  the shares will be issued pursuant to the form s file no 
which became effective on november  and the prospectus supplement dated april  sales cannot exceed million under the prospectus supplement and must be sold at the market price of the common stock as of the day the sales are made 
the company may also finance its future cash needs through solicitation of warrant holders to exercise their warrants at potentially reduced exercise prices  possible strategic collaborations  debt financing or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing shareholders but as the company now has insufficient capital to fund operations through the end of the current fiscal year  it may need to offer more substantial discounts 
management anticipates that if it raises financing that it will be at a discount to the market price of common stock of not more than and dilutive to shareholders 
of course  funding may not be available to it on acceptable terms  or at all 
if the company is unable to raise additional funds  it will have to discontinue or significantly curtail operations 
long term debt the company has a single loan facility in place as of june  the loan facility is from haeifc and was originated in june the loan originally had a total facility of  which was reduced in september to the amount of the company s initial draw of  the principal balance owed on the loan as of june  was  this loan is secured by receivables  equipment  materials and inventory  and certain life insurance policies and also required personal guarantees 
the final payment on the haeifc loan will be due in september haeifc has granted the company a waiver from enforcing several loan covenants in the loan agreement 
the waiver is effective through june other commitments and contingencies in may  medical exercised the first of two options to renew the original lease that was entered into on may  with energy northwest  the owner of the applied process engineering laboratory the apel lease  for an additional years with a new lease expiration date of april  due to a reduction in some lab and office space at apel  the rent has been reduced to approximately  per month 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases  including the one remaining three year renewal of the apel lease  are as follows year ending june  thereafter in february  the company signed a license agreement with international brachytherapy sa ibt  a belgian company  covering north america and providing the company with access to ibt s ink jet production process and its proprietary polymer seed technology for use in brachytherapy procedures using cs under the original agreement royalty payments were to be paid on net sales revenue incorporating the technology 
on october   the company entered into amendment no 
the amendment to its license agreement dated february  with ibt 
the company paid license fees of  under the original agreement and  under the amendment during fiscal years and  respectively 
the amendment eliminated the previously required royalty payments based on net sales revenue  and the parties originally intended to negotiate terms for future payments by the company for polymer seed components to be purchased at ibt s cost plus a to be determined profit percentage 
management no longer believes that introducing cs polymer seeds is a viable strategy due to concerns regarding physician acceptance and the costs to revamp the company s existing manufacturing procedures to incorporate this technology 
in december  the company recorded an impairment charge to write down this license based on its current intentions to not utilize this technology 
in november  a subsidiary of the company entered into a written contract with a contractor based in the ukraine to formalize a research and development project originally begun over three years ago to develop a proprietary separation process to manufacture enriched barium 
there is no assurance that this process can be developed 
the contract called for an initial payment of  and a payment of  upon completion of a successful demonstration 
the company s initial demonstration was postponed due to an electrical problem that damaged equipment and due to economic difficulties in the ukraine that have protracted the contractor s efforts with a planned demonstration originally expected in fall the contractor has not delivered a successful demonstration as required by the contract despite on going commitments to the company to do so 
there is no assurance this demonstration will occur or whether it will be successful 
if a successful demonstration occurs  the company will then need decide if the prototype model will produce sufficient quantities of enriched barium or if a larger production model will need to be built for an additional cost estimated to be  to  the company is subject to various local  state  and federal environmental regulations and laws due to the isotopes used to produce the company s product 
as part of normal operations  amounts are expended to ensure that the company is in compliance with these laws and regulations 
while there have been no reportable incidents or compliance issues  the company believes that if it relocates its current production facilities then certain decommissioning expenses will be incurred 
an asset retirement obligation was established in the first quarter of fiscal year for the company s obligations at its new production facility 
this asset retirement obligation will be for obligations to remove any residual radioactive materials and to remove all leasehold improvements 
the industry that the company operates in is subject to product liability litigation 
through its production and quality assurance procedures  the company works to mitigate the risk of any lawsuits concerning its product 
the company also carries product liability insurance to help protect it from this risk 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation management does not believe that the current levels of inflation in the united states have had a significant impact on the operations of the company 
if current levels of inflation hold steady  management does not believe future operations will be negatively impacted
