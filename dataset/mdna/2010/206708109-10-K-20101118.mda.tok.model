results of operations fiscal years and revenues 
year ended september  variance dollars revenues year ended september  united states europe other total revenues revenues increased  or million  in compared to this increase was primarily due to the growth in the number of customers for our subscription services  as a result of higher market demand for our subscription services and high rates of retention of existing subscription customers 
we believe this demand reflects the market s growing awareness of our on demand employee spend management solutions and the increasing acceptance of outsourced services 
the increase in revenues outside of the united states was primarily the result of our etap acquisition in august as part of our overall growth  we expect the percentage of our revenues generated in europe and the asia pacific region to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues

these increases were primarily due to an increase in headcount and growth of the business 
we expect cost of operations expenses to continue to trend down as a percentage of total revenues over the long term as the incremental cost to deploy and support each new customer is expected to decrease due to 
table of contents economies of scale anticipated in our subscription service model infrastructure

we also make estimates and judgments in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we then must measure the benefit as the 
table of contents largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement

our board of directors previously authorized a stock repurchase program repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock through january in december  our board of directors extended the repurchase program for an additional two year period expiring in january  and increased the number of shares eligible for repurchase by an additional million shares  from million shares to million shares

there can be no assurances that any such funds will be available or  if available  will be on acceptable terms to meet our business needs

capital leases we lease equipment  some of which is required to be capitalized if it meets certain criteria  with the related asset recorded in property and equipment and an offsetting amount recorded as a liability

we lease our current headquarters in redmond  washington under an operating lease that expires on may  the lease agreement for our headquarters in redmond  washington provides for an eight year term with an option to renew for an additional five years 
we do not include amounts for certain operating expenses under these leases such as common area maintenance 
we also lease office space in the united states in the states of arizona  california  georgia  illinois  massachusetts  minnesota  texas and virginia  and internationally in australia  china hong kong  czech republic  france  germany  netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom 
purchase obligations we have future minimum purchase obligations under arrangements with third parties that are enforceable and legally binding 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and 
table of contents expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those we deem most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  including those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include business combinations  revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable and income taxes 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services which include software maintenance services  and to a much lesser degree  consulting services and the sale of software licenses 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 
revenues our revenues are typically recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer and consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services  amortization of related set up fees  and amortization of fees paid for software maintenance services under software license arrangements 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred until the customer begins service and is recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships  which generally range from two to five years 
in addition to set up fees  our deferred revenue balances include subscription fees paid in advance of their recognition and software maintenance fees related to our legacy license offerings 
software maintenance services include technical support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
fees for software maintenance services are typically billed annually in advance of performance of the services with provisions for subsequent automatic annual renewals 
we defer the related revenues and recognize them ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which typically are one year 

table of contents consulting services consist of fees for professional services  which relate to system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
consulting services that are sold with the subscription service are recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships 
consulting services that are sold after the initial contract are typically billed and recognized as revenue on a time and materials basis 
in some instances  we sell consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts and  in such cases  recognize consulting revenues as milestones or services are completed 
revenues are adjusted for estimated sales allowances  which are based on our historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
when we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the revenues on a gross basis and amounts paid to our reseller partners are recognized as cost of operations 
our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  establish pricing of the arrangement and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
when our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and cost of operations 
income taxes we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
since we are in a net operating loss position for those positions that require a reserve we do not include interest and penalties related to our contingencies in our income tax expense 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  proprietary technology and non compete agreements  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  as well as expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents accounts receivable allowances we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and sales credits issued 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and the current economic environment 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
new accounting standards see note of the notes to financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements  including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate  foreign exchange  market and market interest risks 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as of september  short term investments were invested primarily in highly liquid investment vehicles including money market accounts that bear interest at variable overnight or short term rates 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
an immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates of basis points at september   could result in a million reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
market risk and market interest risk 
in march  we issued at par value million principal amount of our senior convertible notes due in initial notes 
in addition  the underwriters were granted an over allotment option to purchase an additional million principal amount of senior convertible notes due in  which brings the total amount issued under such notes and the initial notes to million collectively  notes 
holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or stock at our option 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate note hedges transactions and the sale of warrants 
these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 

table of contents our notes have fixed annual interest rates at and therefore  we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our notes 
however  the value of the notes is exposed to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price 
the carrying value of our notes was million as of september  this represents the liability component of the million principal balance as of september  for further information  see note of the notes to financial statements 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly in the euro  canadian dollar  british pound sterling and australian dollar 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we may seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts would offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes
