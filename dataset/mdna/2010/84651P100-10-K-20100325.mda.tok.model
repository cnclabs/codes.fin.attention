general prior to july   spark networks plc now known as spark networks limited was a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales limited 
since the completion of our reorganization on july  through the scheme of arrangement  the common stock of spark networks  inc  a delaware corporation and limited s parent entity  has been traded on the nyse amex formerly the american stock exchange and the company has become limited s successor reporting entity 
the company and its consolidated subsidiaries provide online personals services in the united states and internationally  whereby adults are able to post information about themselves profiles on the company s web sites and search and contact other individuals who have posted profiles 
membership to the company s online services  which includes the posting of a personal profile and photos  and access to its database of profiles  is free 
the company typically charges a subscription fee for varying subscription lengths typically  one  three  six and twelve months to members  allowing them to initiate communication with other members and subscribers using the company s onsite communication tools  including anonymous email  instant messenger  chat rooms and message boards 
for most of the company s services  two way communications through the company s email platform can only take place between paying subscribers 
for the year ended december   we had  average paying subscribers  representing a decrease of from the year ended december  paying subscribers are defined as individuals who have paid a monthly fee for access to communication and web site features beyond those provided to our non paying members 
average paying subscribers for each month are calculated as the sum of the paying subscribers at the beginning and end of the month  divided by two 
average paying subscribers for periods longer than one month are calculated as the sum of the average paying subscribers for each month  divided by the number of months in such period 
our key web sites include jdate 
com  which primarily targets jewish singles in the united states  americansingles which was rebranded as spark 
com in december  which targets singles in the united states  blacksingles 
com  which primarily targets black singles in the united states  and christianmingle 
com  which primarily targets christian singles in the united states 
our subscription fees have traditionally been charged on a monthly basis  with discounts for longer term subscriptions 
we have grown both internally and through acquisitions of entities  and selected assets of entities  offering online personals services and related businesses 
through our business acquisitions  we have expanded into new markets  leveraged and enhanced our existing brands to improve our position within new markets  and gained valuable intellectual property 

table of contents during the last three years  in addition to a number of small acquisitions  we made the following larger acquisitions in december  we acquired certain digital media assets and liabilities of a company for total consideration of million 
of the million consideration   was assigned to indefinite life domain names and the remaining amount was assigned to developed software  to be amortized over years 
these acquired assets expanded and enhanced our current product offerings 
on february   we purchased the assets of hurrydate  a leading online personals and singles events company 
of the million cash consideration paid   was assigned to member databases and is being amortized over three years   was assigned to subscriber databases and was amortized over five months   was assigned to developed software which is being amortized over five years   was assigned to domain names which are not subject to amortization and the remainder was assigned to goodwill 
in and  the company impaired the goodwill balances associated with hurrydate 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on the timely introduction and performance of our future web sites  services and features  the ability to address the needs of our members and paying subscribers and the ability to respond to web sites  services and features introduced by competitors 
to address this challenge  we have invested and will continue to invest existing personnel resources  namely application developers and systems engineers  in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new services  which may include new web sites as well as new features and functions designed to increase the probability of communication among our members and paying subscribers and to enhance their online personals experiences 
we believe we have sufficient cash resources on hand to accomplish the enhancements currently contemplated 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cost of revenue  prepaid advertising  web site and software development costs  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  legal contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with our board of directors and the board has reviewed these disclosures 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from subscription fees 
revenue is presented net of credits and credit card chargebacks 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
revenue recognition occurs ratably over the subscription period  beginning when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred access has been granted  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
paying subscribers primarily pay in advance using a credit card and  subject to certain conditions identified in our terms and conditions  all purchases are final and 
table of contents nonrefundable 
subscription fees collected in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue  using the straight line method  over the term of the subscription 
we reserve for potential credit card chargebacks based on our historical chargeback experience 
we also earn a small amount of revenue from advertising sales and offline events 
we record advertising revenue as it is earned and included it in the total revenue of each segment that generates advertising sales 
revenue and the related expenses associated with offline events are recognized at the conclusion of each event 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of direct marketing costs  compensation and other employee related costs including stock based compensation for personnel dedicated to maintaining our data centers  data center expenses and credit card fees 
we incur substantial expenses related to our advertising in order to generate traffic to our web sites 
these advertising costs are primarily online advertising  including affiliate and co brand arrangements  and are directly attributable to the revenue we receive from our subscribers 
we have entered into numerous affiliate arrangements  under which our affiliates advertise or promote our web site  and earn a fee whenever visitors click through the affiliate s advertisement to one of our web sites and register or subscribe  on our web site 
we do not typically have any exclusivity arrangements with our affiliates  and some of our affiliates may also be affiliates for our competitors 
under our co branded arrangements  our co brand partners may operate their own separate web sites where visitors can register and subscribe to our web sites 
affiliate deals  co brand deals and online advertising arrangements may fall in the categories of cps  cpa  cpc  or cpm  as discussed below 
our advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of each individual contract 
the majority of our advertising expenses are based on four pricing models cost per subscription cps where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based upon the number of new paying subscribers it generates  cost per acquisition cpa where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of new member registrations it generates  cost per click cpc where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of clicks to our web sites it generates  and cost per thousand for banner advertising cpm where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of times it displays our advertisements 
we estimate  in certain circumstances  the total clicks or impressions delivered by our vendors in order to determine amounts due under these contracts 
prepaid advertising expenses in certain circumstances  we pay in advance for internet based advertising on other web sites  and expense the prepaid amounts as cost of revenue over the contract periods as the contracted web site delivers on its commitment 
we evaluate the realization of prepaid amounts at each reporting period and expense prepaid amounts if the contracted web site is unable to deliver on its commitment and is not willing or able to repay the undelivered prepaid amounts valuation of goodwill  identified intangibles and other long lived assets we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and test property  plant and equipment and 
table of contents other intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant decline in actual projected revenue  a significant decline in the market value of our common stock  a significant decline in performance of certain acquired companies relative to our original projections  an excess of our net book value over our market value  a significant decline in our operating results relative to our operating forecasts  a significant change in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset  a shift in technology demands and development  and a significant turnover in key management or other personnel 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the case of the other intangible assets and other long lived assets  this measurement is only performed if the projected undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than its carrying value 
in  we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined the fair value of each reporting unit and compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the jewish networks reporting unit was significantly higher than the carrying value as of december  and thus did not require any impairment 
based upon several valuation assumptions  including lower expected performance and lower industry multiples  the analysis concluded that the carrying value of the other affinity networks business was higher than its estimated fair value 
as a result  the company performed the second step under the guidance to assess the fair value of the assets and liabilities of other affinity networks 
the analysis resulted in impairment to goodwill and domain names of million and million  respectively 
in  we paid the final million in earn out payments for the hurrydate business 
the earn out payments were recorded as impairment expense based on business performance 
there were no additional impairments as a result of the assessment 
as of december   jewish networks and other affinity networks carried goodwill balances of million and million  respectively 
additionally  in  we impaired approximately  of capitalized software development costs when we determined that a web based product failed to perform to company standards 
in  the company performed its annual valuation and concluded that a sustained decline in hurrydate s speed dating business had reduced projected cash flows below the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
as such  the company impaired the entire amount of hurrydate s goodwill of million 
no other impairment charges resulted from this evaluation since the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount 
also in we were capitalizing costs related to a web site that we planned to develop 
we decided that we would not continue the development in the same manner and as such we impaired the  which had been capitalized up to that point 
accounting for business combinations we have acquired the stock or specific assets of a number of companies from through some of which were considered to be business acquisitions 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

table of contents the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful life assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
different classes of assets will have varying useful lives 
for example  the useful life of a member database  which is typically three years  is not the same as the useful life of a paying subscriber list  which is typically three months  or a domain name  which is indefinite 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization recorded in a given period or no amortization for indefinite lived intangibles 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the value of our intangible and other long lived assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
we review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements and under business legal proceedings 
to the extent that a loss related to a contingency is reasonably estimable and probable  we accrue an estimate of that loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on certain pending litigation  we may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of such litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and make or  if necessary  revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
in the fourth quarter of  we analyzed our past performance as well as other factors and concluded that all of the net operating losses incurred by the company would more likely than not be used to offset future income and the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was released 
at december   we had gross net operating loss nol carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income  respectively  which expire beginning in the years for federal purposes and for state purposes 
under section of the internal revenue code  the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards can be limited based on changes in the percentage ownership of the company 
of the nols available  approximately million for federal purposes are attributable to losses incurred by an acquired subsidiary 
such losses are subject to other restrictions on usage including the requirement that they are only available to offset future income of the subsidiary 
in addition  the available nols do not include any amounts generated by the acquired subsidiary prior to the acquisition date due to substantial uncertainty regarding the company s ability to realize the benefit in the future 
as a result of the adoption of the share based payment guidance  the company will recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  
table of contents deferred tax assets are not recognized for nol carry forwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december   deferred tax assets do not include approximately million of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of the company s nol carry forwards 
additional paid in capital will be increased up to an additional million if and when such excess tax benefits are realized 
during  approximately million related to net excess tax benefits were realized 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside the united states 
we have filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions as well as other matters 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  we regularly assesses our tax position for such matters and  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
to the extent reserves are recorded  they will be utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired and or at the conclusion of the tax examination 
we believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity 
we recognize the tax effects from an uncertain tax position in our financial statements  only if the position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
tax positions that meet the recognition threshold are reported at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
stock based compensation we adopted the share based payment guidance in using the modified prospective approach and accordingly periods prior to have not been restated to reflect the impact of the guidance 
prior to our adoption of the guidance  we did not record tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our deferred tax assets in future tax returns 
the guidance requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
in and  we recognized cash inflows of approximately million and million  respectively  related to tax provision or benefit from stock based compensation 
we calculate the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield and the expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we used historical and empirical data to assess different forfeiture rates for three different groups of employees 
we must reassess forfeiture rates when deemed necessary and we must calibrate actual forfeiture behavior to what has already been recorded 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
the volatility rate was derived by examining historical stock price behavior and assessing management s expectations of stock price behavior during the term of the option 
the term of the options was derived based on the simplified method calculation 
we are using the simplified method calculation  which is derived by averaging the vesting term with the contractual terms due to a change in the stock exchange on which the company s stock was traded 
we do not believe exercise behavior and expected term are consistent across the different stock exchanges 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we believe the accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 

table of contents segment reporting segment reporting requires the use of the management approach in determining the reportable operating segments 
the management approach considers the internal organization and reporting used by our chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
the company s financial reporting includes detailed data on four separate operating segments which were principally determined based on similarity of economic characteristics 
during the third quarter  we changed our financial reporting to include data on four newly defined operating segments jewish networks  which consists of jdate 
com  jdate 
co 
il  cupid 
co 
il and their respective co branded and private label web sites  general market networks  which consists of americansingles 
com and date 
ca  which were both rebranded as spark 
com in december of and date 
co 
uk which was rebranded as spark 
com in february  and their respective co branded and private label web sites  other affinity networks  which consists of the company s provo  utah based properties which are primarily made up of sites targeted towards various religious  ethnic  geographic and special interest groups  and offline and other businesses  which consists of revenue generated from offline activities  hurrydate events and subscriptions  and other web sites and businesses 
the company believes the segments will provide investors with a more accurate picture of the performance of the business 
results of operations the following is a more detailed discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented 
the following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue sales and marketing customer service technical operations development general and administrative depreciation amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill impairment of goodwill  long lived assets and other assets total costs and expenses operating income loss interest and other income expenses  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss

this measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses  budget  forecast and compensate management 
we believe this measure provides management and investors with a consistent view  period to period  of the core earnings generated from on going operations and excludes the impact of i non cash items such as stock based compensation  asset impairments  non cash currency translation adjustments related to an inter company loan and ii one time items that have not occurred in the past two years and are not expected to recur in the next two years  such as the scheme of arrangement 
adjusted ebitda has inherent limitations in evaluating the performance of the company  including  but not limited to the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect the cash capital expenditures during the measurement period adjusted ebitda does not reflect any changes in working capital requirements during the measurement period adjusted ebitda does not reflect the cash tax payments during the measurement period adjusted ebitda may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry  thus limiting its value as a comparative measure adjusted ebitda should not be construed as a substitute for net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance or financial position  as adjusted ebitda is not defined by gaap 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets  non cash currency translation adjustments for inter company loans and scheme of arrangement costs and one time items that have not occurred in the past two years and are not expected to recur in the next two years 
key metric average paying subscribers we regularly review average paying subscribers as a key metric to evaluate the effectiveness of our operating strategies and monitor the financial performance of our business 
subscribers are defined as individuals for whom we collect a monthly fee for access to communication and web site features beyond those provided to our non paying members 
average paying subscribers for each month are calculated as the sum of the paying subscribers at the beginning and end of the month  divided by two 
average paying subscribers for periods longer than one month are calculated as the sum of the average paying subscribers for each month  divided by the number of months in such period
