item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a reit that owns and manages a portfolio of principally mortgage backed securities 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our investment securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of investment securities and from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiaries offer diversified real estate  asset management and other financial services 
fidac and merganser are our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries that are registered investment advisors that generate advisory and service fee income 
rcap is our wholly owned broker dealer taxable reit subsidiary which generates fee income 
we are primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage backed securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans issued or guaranteed by federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae collectively  mortgage backed securities 
we also invest in federal home loan bank fhlb  freddie mac and fannie mae debentures 
the mortgage backed securities and agency debentures are collectively referred to herein as investment securities 
under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to rated high quality mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
in addition  we may directly or indirectly invest part of this remaining of our assets in other types of securities  including without limitation  unrated debt  equity or derivative securities  to the extent consistent with our reit qualification requirements 
the derivative securities in which we invest may include securities representing the right to receive interest only or a disproportionately large amount of interest  as well as inverse floaters  which may have imbedded leverage as part of their structural characteristics 
we may acquire mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date  substantially all of the mortgage backed securities that we have acquired have been backed by single family residential mortgage loans 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining our status as a reit is that we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
the table below provides quarterly information regarding our average balances  interest income  yield on assets  average repurchase agreement balances  interest expense  cost of funds  net interest income and net interest rate spreads for the quarterly periods presented 
average investment securities held total interest income yield on average investment securities average balance of repurchase agreements interest expense average cost of funds net interest income net interest rate spread ratios for the quarters have been annualized  dollars in thousands quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  does not reflect unrealized gains losses 
the following table presents the cpr experienced on our mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  we believe that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
for the purposes of computing ratios relating to equity measures  throughout this report  equity includes series b preferred stock  which has been treated under gaap as temporary equity 
in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  net income attributable to controlling interest is referred to as net income 
recent developments the liquidity crisis which commenced in august continues through the fourth quarter of during this period of market dislocation  fiscal and monetary policymakers have established new liquidity facilities for primary dealers and commercial banks  reduced short term interest rates  and passed legislation that is intended to address the challenges of mortgage borrowers and lenders 
this legislation  the housing and economic recovery act of  seeks to forestall home foreclosures for distressed borrowers and assist communities with foreclosure problems 
although these aggressive steps are intended to protect and support the us housing and mortgage market  we continue to operate under difficult market conditions 
subsequent to june   there were increased market concerns about freddie mac and fannie mae s ability to withstand future credit losses associated with securities held in their investment portfolios  and on which they provide guarantees  without the direct support of the us government 
in september  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed into the conservatorship of the federal housing finance agency  or fhfa  their federal regulator  pursuant to its powers under the federal housing finance regulatory reform act of  a part of the housing and economic recovery act of as the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac  the fhfa controls and directs the operations of fannie mae and freddie mac and may take over the assets of and operate fannie mae and freddie mac with all the powers of the shareholders  the directors  and the officers of fannie mae and freddie mac and conduct all business of fannie mae and freddie mac  collect all obligations and money due to fannie mae and freddie mac  perform all functions of fannie mae and freddie mac which are consistent with the conservator s appointment  preserve and conserve the assets and property of fannie mae and freddie mac  and contract for assistance in fulfilling any function  activity  action or duty of the conservator 
in addition to fhfa becoming the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac  the treasury and fhfa have entered into preferred stock purchase agreements pspas between the treasury and fannie mae and freddie mac pursuant to which the treasury will ensure that each of fannie mae and freddie mac maintains a positive net worth 
on december   the us treasury amended the terms of the us treasury s pspas with fannie mae and freddie mac to remove the billion per institution limit established under the pspas until the end of the us treasury also amended the pspas with respect to the requirements for fannie mae and freddie mac to reduce their portfolios 
the emergency economic stabilization act of  or eesa  was also enacted 
the eesa provides the us secretary of the treasury with the authority to establish a troubled asset relief program  or tarp  to purchase from financial institutions up to billion of equity or preferred securities  residential or commercial mortgages and any securities  obligations  or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages  that in each case was originated or issued on or before march   as well as any other financial instrument that the us secretary of the treasury  after consultation with the chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability  upon transmittal of such determination  in writing  to the appropriate committees of the us congress 
the eesa also provides for a program that would allow companies to insure their troubled assets 
in addition  the us government  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or federal reserve  and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis 
the term asset backed securities loan facility  or talf  was first announced by the us department of treasury  or the treasury  on november   and has been expanded in size and scope since its initial announcement 
under the talf  the federal reserve bank of new york makes non recourse loans to borrowers to fund their purchase of eligible assets  currently certain asset backed securities but not residential mortgage backed securities 
on march   the us treasury announced preliminary plans to expand the talf beyond non mortgage abs to include legacy securitization assets  including non agency rmbs and cmbs that were originally rated aaa and issued prior to january  on may   the federal reserve published the terms for the expansion of talf to cmbs and announced that  beginning in june  up to billion of talf loans would be available to finance purchases of cmbs 
the federal reserve has also announced that  beginning in july  eligible legacy cmbs may also be purchased under the talf 
many legacy cmbs  however  have had their ratings downgraded  and at least one rating agency  s p  has announced that further downgrades are likely in the future as property values have declined 
these downgrades may significantly reduce the quantity of legacy cmbs that are talf eligible 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize this program successfully or at all 
in addition  on march  the government announced that the treasury in conjunction with the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  and the federal reserve  would create the public private investment program  or ppip 
the ppip aims to recreate a market for specific illiquid residential and commercial loans and securities through a number of joint public and private investment funds 
the ppip is designed to draw new private capital into the market for these securities and loans by providing government equity co investment and attractive public financing 
as these programs are still in early stages of operations  it is not possible for us to predict how these programs will impact our business 
there can be no assurance that the eesa  talf  ppip or other policy initiatives will have a beneficial impact on the financial markets  including current extreme levels of volatility 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the liquidity crisis could adversely affect one or more of our lenders and could cause one or more of our lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing 
this could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce liquidity 
if one or more major market participants fails  it could negatively impact the marketability of all fixed income securities  including agency mortgage securities  and this could negatively impact the value of the securities in our portfolio  thus reducing its net book value 
furthermore  if many of our lenders are unwilling or unable to provide us with additional financing  we could be forced to sell our investment securities at an inopportune time when prices are depressed 
even with the current situation in the mortgage sector we do not anticipate having difficulty converting our assets to cash or extending financing  due to the fact that our investment securities have an actual or implied aaa rating and principal payment is guaranteed 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
fair value of investment securities all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
although we generally intend to hold most of our investment securities until maturity  we may  from time to time  sell any of our investment securities as part our overall management of our portfolio 
accordingly  we are required to classify all of our investment securities as available for sale 
our policy is to obtain fair values from independent sources 
fair values from independent sources are compared to internal prices for reasonableness 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
consideration is given to our intent to sell the investment securities  whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery  or whether we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities 
further  the security is analyzed for credit loss the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
the credit loss  if any  will then be recognized in the statement of earnings  while the balance of impairment related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  wall street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
derivative financial instruments hedging activity prior to the fourth quarter of  we designated interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges  whereby the swaps were recorded at fair value on our balance sheet as assets and liabilities with any changes in fair value recorded in oci 
in a cash flow hedge  a swap would exactly match the pricing date of the relevant repurchase agreement 
through the end of the third quarter of we continued to be able to effectively match the swaps with the repurchase agreements therefore entering into effective hedge transactions 
however  due to the volatility of the credit markets  it is no longer practical to match the pricing dates of both the swaps and the repurchase agreements 
as a result  we voluntarily discontinued hedge accounting after the third quarter of through a combination of de designating previously defined hedge relationships and not designating new contracts as cash flow hedges 
the de designation of cash flow hedges requires that the net derivative gain or loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedge should continue to be reported in accumulated oci  unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we continue to hold repurchase agreements in excess of swap contracts and have no indication that interest payments on the hedged repurchase agreements are in jeopardy of discontinuing 
therefore  the deferred losses related to these derivatives that have been de designated will not be recognized immediately and will remain in oci 
these losses are reclassified into earnings during the contractual terms of the swap agreements starting as of october  changes in the unrealized gains or losses on the interest rate swaps subsequent to september  are reflected in our statement of operations 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of our investment securities through the use of repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective agreements 
repurchase agreements entered into by rcap are matched with reverse repurchase agreements and are recorded on trade date with the duration of such repurchase agreements mirroring those of the matched reverse repurchase agreements 
these repurchase agreements entered into by rcap are recorded at the contract amount and margin calls are filled by rcap as required based on any deficiencies in collateral versus the contract price 
the repurchase agreements are recorded at the contract amount and margin calls are filled by rcap as required based on any deficiencies in collateral versus the contract price 
rcap generates income from the spread between what is earned on the reverse repurchase agreements and what is paid on the repurchase agreements 
intercompany transactions are eliminated in the statement of financial condition  statement of operations  and statement of cash flows 
cash flows related to rcap s repurchase agreements are included in cash flows from operating activity 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit and intend to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  we will not be subjected to federal income tax to the extent of our distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and stock ownership tests are met 
we  fidac  merganser  and rcap have made separate joint elections to treat fidac  merganser  and rcap as taxable reit subsidiaries 
as such  fidac  merganser  and rcap are taxable as domestic c corporations and subject to federal and state and local income taxes based upon their taxable income 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles our acquisition of fidac and merganser were accounted for using the purchase method 
the cost of fidac and merganser were allocated to the assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets and the liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill 
goodwill and finite lived intangible assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment 
this evaluation requires significant judgment 
recent accounting pronouncements general principles generally accepted accounting principles asc in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles codification which revises the framework for selecting the accounting principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the objective of the codification is to establish the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb 
codification was effective september  in adopting the codification  all non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification is superseded and deemed non authoritative 
codification requires any references within the consolidated financial statements be modified from fasb issues to asc 
however  in accordance with the fasb accounting standards codification notice to constituents v  we will not reference specific sections of the asc but will use broad topic references 
our recent accounting pronouncements section has been reformatted to reflect the same organizational structure as the asc 
broad topic references will be updated with pending content as they are released 
assets investments in debt and equity securities asc new guidance was provided to make impairment guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments otti on debt and equity securities in financial statements 
this guidance was also the result of the securities and exchange commission sec mark to market study mandated under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
the sec s recommendation was to evaluate the need for modifications or the elimination of current otti guidance to provide for a more uniform system of impairment testing standards for financial instruments 
the guidance revises the otti evaluation methodology 
previously the analytical focus was on whether we had the intent and ability to retain its investment in the debt security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
now the focus is on whether we have the intent to sell the investment securities  it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery  or it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment securities 
further  the security is analyzed for credit loss  the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
the credit loss  if any  will then be recognized in the statement of operations  while the balance of impairment related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income 
this guidance became effective for all interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  and we decided to early adopt 
for the year ended december   we did not have unrealized losses in investment securities that were deemed other than temporary 
broad transactions business combinations asc this guidance establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in a business combination at their fair value at acquisition date 
asc alters the treatment of acquisition related costs  business combinations achieved in stages referred to as a step acquisition  the treatment of gains from a bargain purchase  the recognition of contingencies in business combinations  the treatment of in process research and development in a business combination as well as the treatment of recognizable deferred tax benefits 
asc is effective for business combinations closed in fiscal years beginning after december  and is applicable to business acquisitions completed after january  we did not make any business acquisitions during the year ended december  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation asc on january   fasb amended the guidance concerning noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which requires us to make certain changes to the presentation of its financial statements 
this guidance requires us to classify noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interest as part of consolidated net income and to include the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests as part of stockholders equity 
similarly  in its presentation of stockholders equity  we distinguish between equity amounts attributable to controlling interest and amounts attributable to the noncontrolling interests previously classified as minority interest outside of stockholders equity 
in addition to these financial reporting changes  this guidance provides for significant changes in accounting related to noncontrolling interests  specifically  increases and decreases in its controlling financial interests in consolidated subsidiaries will be reported in equity similar to treasury stock transactions 
if a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation  any retained ownership interests are re measured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings 
effective january   the consolidation standards have been amended by asu this amendment updates the existing standard and eliminates the exemption from consolidation of a qualified special purpose entity qspe 
the update requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity which could potentially be significant to the vie 
the update requires enhanced disclosures to provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprises involvement in a vie 
further  ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary on a vie are required 
at this time  the amendment has no material effect on our financial statements 
on january   the fasb voted to indefinitely defer the effective date of asu for a reporting enterprises interest in entities for which it is industry practice to issue financial statements in accordance with investment company standards asc 
this deferral is expected to most significantly affect reporting entities in the investment management industry 
we are evaluating the effect of this update  however  as it stands  the update would have no material effect on the financial statements 
derivatives and hedging asc effective january  and adopted by us prospectively  the fasb issued additional guidance attempting to improve the transparency of financial reporting by mandating the provision of additional information about how derivative and hedging activities affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this guidance changed the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosure about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
to adhere to this guidance  qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts  gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements must be made 
this disclosure framework is intended to better convey the purpose of derivative use in terms of the risks that an entity is intending to manage 
we discontinued hedge accounting as of september   and therefore the effect of the adoption of this guidance was an increase in footnote disclosures 
fair value measurements and disclosures asc in response to the deterioration of the credit markets  fasb issued guidance clarifying how fair value measurements should be applied when valuing securities in markets that are not active 
the guidance provides an illustrative example  utilizing management s internal cash flow and discount rate assumptions when relevant observable data do not exist 
it further clarifies how observable market information and market quotes should be considered when measuring fair value in an inactive market 
it reaffirms the notion of fair value as an exit price as of the measurement date and that fair value analysis is a transactional process and should not be broadly applied to a group of assets 
the guidance was effective upon issuance including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this guidance did not have a material effect on the fair value of our assets since our methodology is consistent with the new guidance 
in october the eesa was signed into law 
section of the eesa mandated that the sec conduct a study on mark to market accounting standards 
the sec provided its study to the us congress on december  part of the recommendations within the study indicated that fair value requirements should be improved through development of application and best practices guidance for determining fair value in illiquid or inactive markets 
as a result of this study and the recommendations therein  on april   the fasb issued additional guidance for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities 
the guidance gives specific factors to evaluate if there has been a decrease in normal market activity and if so  provides a methodology to analyze transactions or quoted prices and make necessary adjustments to fair value 
the objective is to determine the point within a range of fair value estimates that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions 
this guidance became effective for us june  with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  the adoption does not have a major impact on the manner in which we estimate fair value  nor does it have any impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in august  fasb provided further guidance asu regarding the fair value measurement of liabilities 
the guidance states that a quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market is a level fair value measurement 
if the value must be adjusted for factors specific to the liability  then the adjustment to the quoted price of the asset shall render the fair value measurement of the liability a lower level measurement 
this guidance has no material effect on the fair valuation of our liabilities 
in september  fasb issued guidance asu on measuring the fair value of certain alternative investments 
this guidance offers investors a practical expedient for measuring the fair value of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value nav per share 
if an investment falls within the scope of the asu  the reporting entity is permitted  but not required to use the investment s nav to estimate its fair value 
this guidance has no material effect on the fair valuation of our assets 
we do not hold any assets qualifying under this guidance 
in january  fasb issued guidance asu which increases disclosure regarding the fair value of assets 
the key provisions of this guidance include the requirement to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level including a description of the reason for the transfers 
previously this was only required of transfers between level and level assets 
further  reporting entities are required to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  a class is potentially a subset of the assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
additionally  disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are required for either level or level assets 
this portion of the guidance is effective for the company for december  the guidance also requires that the disclosure on any level assets presents separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
in other words  level assets are presented on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
however  this last portion of the guidance is not effective for us until december  adoption of this guidance results in increased footnote disclosure 
financial instruments asc on april   the fasb issued guidance which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements 
the guidance became effective for us on june  the adoption did not have any impact on financial reporting as all financial instruments are currently reported at fair value in both interim and annual periods 
subsequent events asc general standards governing accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
asc also provides guidance on the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date 
we adopted the guidance effective june   and adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluated subsequent events through february  transfers and servicing asc in february fasb issued guidance addressing whether transactions where assets purchased from a particular counterparty and financed through a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty can be considered and accounted for as separate transactions  or are required to be considered linked transactions and may be considered derivatives 
this guidance requires purchases and subsequent financing through repurchase agreements be considered linked transactions unless all of the following conditions apply the initial purchase and the use of repurchase agreements to finance the purchase are not contractually contingent upon each other  the repurchase financing entered into between the parties provides full recourse to the transferee and the repurchase price is fixed  the financial assets are readily obtainable in the market  and the financial instrument and the repurchase agreement are not coterminous 
this guidance was effective january  and the implementation did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
on june   the fasb issued guidance an amendment update to the accounting standards governing the transfer and servicing of financial assets 
this amendment updates the existing standard and eliminates the concept of a qualified special purpose entity qspe  clarifies the surrendering of control to effect sale treatment  and modifies the financial components approach limiting the circumstances in which a financial asset or portion thereof should be derecognized when the transferor maintains continuing involvement 
it defines the term participating interest 
under this standard update  the transferor must recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer  including any retained beneficial interest 
additionally  the amendment requires enhanced disclosures regarding the transferors risk associated with continuing involvement in any transferred assets 
the amendment is effective beginning january  we have determined the amendment has no material effect on the financial statements 
results of operations net income summary for the year ended december   our net income was billion or basic income per average share related to common shareholders  as compared to million net income or basic net income per average share for the year ended december  and net income was million or basic net income per average share related to common shareholders for the year ended december  net income per average share increased by per average share available to common shareholders and total net income increased billion for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  we attribute the increase in total net income for the year ended december  from the year ended december  in part to recording of unrealized gains related to interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december   comparison to an unrealized loss of million which was recorded in for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   also increased due to net interest income increasing by million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the improved interest rate spread 
for the year ended december   net gain on sale of mortgage backed securities was million  as compared to a net gain of million for the year ended december  we attribute the decrease in total net income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily to recording of unrealized losses related to interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of an unrealized loss of million was recorded in the income statement for the year ended december   as the result of de designation of cash flow hedges 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we recorded changes in the fair values in our interest rate swaps in the accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of financial condition 
the interest rate spread increased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net gain on sale of mortgage backed securities was million  as compared to a net gain of million in the table below presents the net income loss summary for the years ended december    and net income summary dollars in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  interest income investments securities loaned total interest income interest expense repurchase agreements securities borrowed total interest expense net interest income other income loss investment advisory and service fees gain on sale of investment securities gain on termination of interest rate swaps income from trading securities dividend income from available for sale equity securities loss on other than temporarily impaired securities loss on receivable from prime broker unrealized gain loss on interest rate swaps total other income loss expenses distribution fees general and administrative expenses total expenses income before loss on equity method investment  income taxes and noncontrolling interest loss on equity method investment income taxes net income noncontrolling interest net income attributable to controlling interest dividends on preferred stock net income available to common shareholders weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding basic net income per average common share diluted net income per average common share average total assets average equity return on average total assets return on average equity interest income and average earning asset yield we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  our primary source of income is interest income 
our interest income was billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december   and billion for the year ended december  the yield on average investment securities was   and for the respective years 
the prepayment speeds increased to an average of cpr for the year ended december  from an average of cpr for the year ended december  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest income declined by million  due to the decline in yield on average investment securities of basis points 
interest income increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to the increased average assets of billion

we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of billion for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of billion for the year ended december  we had average borrowed funds of billion and total interest expense of billion for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the cost of funds rate decreased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the cost of funds rate decreased by basis points and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million over the prior year due to the substantial decrease in the average cost of funds rate 
interest expense for the year ended december  remained constant at billion when compared to december  our average cost of funds was above average one month libor and above average six month libor for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was below average one month libor and below average six month libor for the year ended december  our average cost of funds was below average one month libor and below average six month libor for the year ended december  the table below shows our average borrowed funds and average cost of funds as compared to average one month and average six month libor for the years ended december      and and the four quarters in average cost of funds ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized  dollars in thousands average borrowed funds interest expense average cost of funds average one month libor average six month libor average one month libor relative to average six month libor average cost of funds relative to average one month libor average cost of funds relative to average six month libor for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended september  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended march  net interest income our net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  our net interest income increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  because of the increased interest rate spread 
our net interest rate spread for the year ended december  was  which was basis points greater than the interest rate spread of for the year ended december  of 
this basis point increase in interest rate spread for over the spread for was the result of the decrease in the average cost of funds of basis points  which was only partially offset by a decrease in average yield on average interest earning assets of basis points 
our net interest income increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   because of the increased average asset base of billion in and the increased interest rate spread of basis points

gross assets under management will vary from time to time because of changes in the amount of net assets fidac and merganser manage as well as changes in the amount of leverage used by the various funds and accounts fidac manages 
gains and losses on sales of investment securities and interest rate swaps for the year ended december   we sold investment securities with a carrying value of billion for aggregate net gain of million 
for the year ended december   we sold investment securities with a carrying value of billion for an aggregate net gain of million 
for the year ended december   we sold investment securities with an aggregate historical amortized value of billion for a net gain of million 
in addition  for the year ended december   we had a million gain on the termination of interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
we do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets  which our management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns  or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset liability management strategy

gross income from trading securities totaled million  and million for the years ended december  and dividend income from available for sale equity securities dividend income from our investment in chimera totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  loss on other than temporarily impaired securities at each quarter end  we review each of our securities to determine if an other than temporary impairment charge would be necessary 
we will take these charges if we determine that we do not intend to hold securities that were in an unrealized loss position for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments or we are required to sell for regulatory or other reasons 
for the year ended december  there was no loss on other than temporarily impaired securities

we attribute the decrease in total net income for the year ended december  from the year ended december  primarily to the de designation of interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in an unrealized loss of million being recorded in the income statement for the year ended december  prior to the fourth quarter of and the de designation of cash flow hedges  we recorded these changes in the market values of interest rate swaps in the statement of financial condition

substantially all of the mortgage assets underlying these mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties 
substantially all of our mortgage backed securities were fhlmc  fnma or gnma mortgage pass through certificates or cmos  which carry an implied aaa rating 
all of our agency debentures are callable and carry an implied aaa rating 
we carry all of our earning assets at fair value 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the life of discount investment securities and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium investment securities 
at december    and we had on our balance sheet a total of million  million and million  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of billion  million and million  respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december   and billion for the year ended december  the average prepayment speed for the year ended december   and was   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the average cpr increased to from during the year ended december   due to an increase in refinancing activity 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

reverse repurchase agreements at december  and  we lent million and million  respectively  to chimera in a weekly reverse repurchase agreement 
this amount is included in the principal amount which approximates fair value in our statement of financial condition 
the interest rate at december  and december  was at the rate of and  respectively 
the collateral for this loan is mortgage backed securities with a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   rcap  in its ordinary course of business  financed though matched reverse repurchase agreements  at market rates  million for a fund that is managed by fidac 
at december   rcap had an outstanding reverse repurchase agreement with a non affiliate of million 
receivable from prime broker on equity investment the net assets of the investment fund we owned are subject to english bankruptcy law  which governs the administration of lehman brothers international europe in administration lbie  as well as the law of new york  which governs the contractual documents 
we invested approximately million in the fund and have redeemed approximately million 
the current assets of the fund still remain at lbie and affiliates of lbie and the ultimate recovery of such amount remains uncertain 
we have entered into the claims resolution agreement between lbie and certain eligible offerees effective december  with respect to these assets the cra 
certain of our assets subject to the cra are held directly at lbie and we have valued such assets in accordance with the valuation date set forth in the cra and the pricing information provided to the company by lbie 
the valuation date with respect to these assets as set forth in the cra is september  certain of our assets subject to the cra are not held directly at lbie and are believed to be held at affiliates of lbie 
given the great degree of uncertainty as to the status of our assets that are not directly held by lbie and are believed to be held at affiliates of lbie  the company has valued such assets at an discount 
the value of the net assets that are not directly held by lbie and are believed to be held at affiliates of lbie is determined on the basis of the best information available to us from time to time  legal and professional advice obtained for the purpose of determining the rights  and on the basis of a number of assumptions which we believe to be reasonable 
we can provide no assurance  however  that it will recover all or any portion of any of the net assets of the investment fund following completion of lbie s administration and any subsequent liquidation 
borrowings as of december   our debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our investment securities 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts which we believe are in excess of our needs 
all of our investment securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to years 
additionally  we have entered into structured borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years 
additionally  we have entered into structured borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity

at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was  with the effect of the interest rate swaps  and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
on february   the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due convertible senior notes for net proceeds following underwriting expenses of approximately million 
interest on the notes will be paid semi annually at a rate of per year and the notes will mature on february  unless earlier repurchased or converted 
the notes will be convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional investment securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our investment securities varies 
our non cash assets are largely actual or implied aaa assets  and accordingly  we have not had  nor do we anticipate having  difficulty in converting our assets to cash 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our investment securities could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
borrowings under our repurchase agreements increased by billion to billion at december   from billion at december  even though borrowing increased over the year  leverage declined from to we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of investment securities increases due to changes in market interest rates of market factors  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of our mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such mortgage backed securities and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mortgage backed securities generally due to principal reduction of such mortgage backed securities from scheduled amortization and resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
the following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements  interest expense on repurchase agreements  the non cancelable office lease and employment agreements at december  the table does not include the effect of net interest rate payments under our interest rate swap agreements

unrealized gains and losses with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of the de designation of interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges during the quarter ended december   unrealized gains and losses in our interest rate swaps impact our gaap income 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities  available for sale equity securities and interest rate swaps in our portfolio prior to de designation 
unrealized gains and losses dollars in thousands at december  unrealized gain unrealized loss net unrealized loss gain unrealized changes in the estimated net fair value of investment securities have one direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive changes increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net fair value of our investment securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
leverage our debt to equity ratio at december   and was  and  respectively 
we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we would cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of investment securities by entering into interest rate swaps 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
we may enter into similar derivative transactions in the future by entering into interest rate collars  caps or floors or purchasing interest only securities 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
capital resources at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends are based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the code for the years ended december  and we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the years ended december   and and for each quarter therein 
consequently  we met the reit income and asset test 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  for the years ended of december    and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests and at least of our assets in qualifying interests plus other real estate related assets 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securities represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december  and december   we were in compliance with this requirement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors  inverse floaters and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value  should interest rates go up or down  and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
change in interest rate projected percentage change in net interest income projected percentage change in portfolio value  with effect of interest rate swaps basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience

these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
