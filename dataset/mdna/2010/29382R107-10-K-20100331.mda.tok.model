overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television and radio assets that reach hispanic consumers across the united states  as well as the border markets of mexico 
we operate in 
table of contents two reportable segments television broadcasting and radio broadcasting 
our net revenue for the year ended december  was million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for and revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations located primarily in california  colorado  connecticut  florida  massachusetts  nevada  new mexico  texas and washington  dc we own and operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
additionally  revenue tends to be affected by the occurrence or non occurrence in a given year of major sporting and political events  such as world cup and major elections 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
the comparability of our results between and is affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
highlights during  we were confronted with a significant advertising downturn  both in television and radio  primarily as a result of the global financial crisis and recession 
nevertheless  our audience shares remained strong in the nation s most densely populated hispanic markets 
we believe that we will continue to face uncertainty in as our advertising customers are forced to make difficult choices in the current economic environment 
on the other hand  we anticipate that we will generate incremental revenue from world cup  political activity and the census during as compared to in both our television and radio segments 
additionally  we anticipate that retransmission consent revenue will continue to be a growing source of net revenues during and thereafter 
net revenue for our television segment decreased to million in from million in this decrease of million  or  in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in local and national advertising rates  which in turn was primarily due to the weak economy 
on the other hand  we generated million of retransmission consent revenue 
we anticipate that retransmission consent revenue will continue to be a growing source of net revenues 
net revenue for our radio segment decreased to million in  from million in this decrease of million  or  in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in local and national advertising sales and advertising rates  which in turn was primarily due to the weak economy 
nevertheless  we continued to concentrate our efforts on local sales  which accounted for of total radio segment sales for the year ended 
table of contents we continue to experience ratings growth in many of our radio markets where we broadcast jos nunca sabes lo que va a tocar you never know what he ll play  which features a mix of spanish language adult contemporary and mexican regional hits from the s through the present  as well as our stations that are broadcasting the piolin por la ma ana  syndicated morning show  one of the highest rated spanish language radio programs in the country 
in january  we converted one of our los angeles radio stations from english language to spanish language and introduced a new format  el gato  an upbeat and energetic regional mexican format  and our ratings for this station have since increased by  as measured by the arbitron survey of october  november and december of compared to the same period in  for adults years of age 
acquisitions and dispositions in april  we acquired the assets of television station kren tv  serving the reno  nevada market for approximately million 
we reduced the carrying value of the assets of television station kren tv to its fair value of million by recording a carrying value adjustment of million 
this charge is included in our consolidated statements of operations for continuing operations 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs and processes applied to these inputs in this acquisition and determined that the acquisition did not constitute a business 
currently  we are restricted from engaging in future acquisitions under the terms of the amended credit facility agreement 
please see liquidity and capital resources below 
in a strategic effort to focus our resources on strengthening existing clusters and expanding into new us hispanic markets  we periodically review our portfolio of media properties and  from time to time  seek to divest non core assets in markets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out media clusters 
in accordance with this strategy  we sold our outdoor advertising operations in may to lamar advertising co 
for million and we no longer have outdoor advertising operations 
accordingly  our financial statements reflect the outdoor advertising operations as discontinued operations  we have presented the related assets and liabilities as assets held for sale and reclassified the related revenue and expenses as discontinued operations 
relationship with univision substantially all of our television stations are univision or telefutura affiliated television stations 
our network affiliation agreements with univision provide certain of our owned stations the exclusive right to broadcast univision s primary network and telefutura network programming in their respective markets 
these long term affiliation agreements each expire in  and can be renewed for multiple  successive two year terms at univision s option  subject to our consent 
under the network affiliation agreements  univision acts as our exclusive sales representative for the sale of national and regional advertising sales on our univision and telefutura affiliate television stations  and entravision pays certain sales representation fees to univision relating to national and regional advertising sales 
during the years ended december  and  the amount we paid univision in this capacity was and million  respectively 
in august  we entered into a proxy agreement with univision pursuant to which we granted to univision the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent agreements for our univision and telefutura affiliated television station signals for a term of six years 
among other things  the proxy agreement provides terms relating to compensation to be paid to us by univision with respect to retransmission consent agreements entered into with cable and other television service providers

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of the company s operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets and impairment charge 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on the following in thousands years ended december  change to change to as restated net revenue television radio consolidated direct operating expenses television radio consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio consolidated segment operating profit television radio consolidated corporate expenses impairment charge operating income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda capital expenditures television radio consolidated total assets television radio assets held for sale consolidated footnotes on next page 
table of contents percentage not meaningful 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means net income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the maximum allowed leverage ratio  maximum capital expenditures and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum allowed leverage ratio may not exceed to the actual leverage ratio was as follows in each case as of december  to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into an amendment to our credit facility agreement in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation expense  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used to make executive compensation decisions 

table of contents amounts represent outdoor advertising assets classified as assets held for sale 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is cash flows from operating activities 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cash flows from operating activities follows in thousands years ended december  as restated consolidated adjusted ebitda interest expense interest income gain loss on debt extinguishment income tax benefit amortization of syndication contracts payments on syndication contracts non cash stock based compensation included in direct operating expenses non cash stock based compensation included in selling  general and administrative expenses non cash stock based compensation included in corporate expenses depreciation and amortization impairment charge carrying value adjustment in discontinued operations reclassified items in discontinued operations equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates net loss depreciation and amortization impairment charge deferred income taxes amortization of debt issue costs amortization of syndication contracts payments on syndication contracts equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate non cash stock based compensation loss gain on debt extinguishment change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements changes in assets and liabilities  net of effect of acquisitions and dispositions increase decrease in accounts receivable increase decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets increase decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities effect of discontinued operations cash flows from operating activities footnotes on preceding page

the term loan under the syndicated bank credit facility has been drawn in full  the proceeds of which were used i to refinance million outstanding under the former syndicated bank credit facility  ii to complete a tender offer for the previously outstanding million senior subordinated notes  and iii for general corporate purposes 
the term loan matures in and the revolving facility expires in our ability to make additional borrowings under the syndicated bank credit facility is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants  including financial ratios  and other conditions set forth in the syndicated bank credit facility 
on march   we entered into an amendment to our syndicated bank credit facility agreement 
pursuant to this amendment  among other things the interest that we pay under the credit facility increased 
both the revolver and term loan borrowings under the amendment bear interest at a variable interest rate based on either libor or a base rate  in either case plus an applicable margin that varies depending upon our leverage ratio 
borrowings under both our revolver and term loan bear interest at libor plus a margin of when the leverage ratio is greater than or equal to when the leverage ratio is less than but greater than or equal to  borrowings under both our revolver and term loan will bear interest at libor plus a margin of 
when the leverage ratio is less than  borrowings under both our revolver and term loan will bear interest at libor plus a margin of 
the term loan currently bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  as of december   million of the term loan was outstanding 
the total amount of our revolver facility was reduced from million to million 
borrowings under the revolver are restricted to million in the aggregate during any rolling day period when the leverage ratio is less than of the maximum allowable ratio during the applicable period 
new conditions have been added for loans under the revolver facility greater than million 
the revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on leverage covenants 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million was available under the revolving facility for future borrowings 
in addition  we pay a quarterly unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the level of facility used 
there are more stringent financial covenants relating to maximum allowed leverage ratio  maximum capital expenditures and fixed charge coverage ratio 
beginning march   through december   the maximum allowed leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  is 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio decreases to in the first quarter of on september  the maximum allowed leverage ratio decreases to and on december  the maximum allowed leverage ratio decreases to beginning march   and through the term of the agreement  the maximum allowed leverage ratio is 
the actual leverage ratio was to as of december  therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant as of this date 
from march   through the term of the agreement  the minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio is 
there is a mandatory prepayment clause for of the proceeds of certain asset dispositions  regardless of our leverage ratio 
in addition  if we have excess cash flow  as defined in our syndicated bank credit facility  of such excess cash flow must be used to reduce our outstanding loan balance on a quarterly basis 

table of contents beginning march   the senior leverage ratio and net leverage ratio were eliminated 
capital expenditures may not exceed million in each of and we are restricted from making acquisitions and investments when the leverage ratio is greater than  with an exception to permit the completion of the acquisition of television assets serving the reno  nevada market 
we are restricted from making future repurchases of shares of our common stock  except under a limited circumstance  which we utilized in may and may utilize again in the future 
we are restricted from making any further debt repurchases in the secondary market 
the amendment also contains additional covenants  representations and provisions that are usual and customary for credit facilities of this type 
all other provisions of our credit facility agreement  as amended prior to march  remain in full force and effect unless expressly amended or modified by the march amendment 
at the time we entered into the amended credit facility agreement  we made a prepayment of million to reduce the outstanding amount of our term loans and paid our lenders an amendment fee 
we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of million for fees  unamortized finance costs and interest rate swap agreement termination costs associated with the amendment to the syndicated bank credit facility during the year ended december  the amended credit facility agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets  as well as the pledge of the stock of substantially all of our subsidiaries  including the special purpose subsidiary formed to hold our fcc licenses 
the amended credit facility agreement contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we might be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the amended credit facility agreement 
lenders holding more than of the loans and commitments under the syndicated bank credit facility may elect to accelerate the maturity of loans upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default 
the amended credit facility agreement contains certain financial covenants relating to maximum leverage ratio  maximum capital expenditures and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as explained in more detail above  the covenants become increasingly restrictive in the later years of the amended credit facility agreement 
the amended credit facility agreement also requires us to maintain fcc licenses for broadcast properties and contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the payment of dividends  the repurchase of shares of our own common stock  the making of acquisitions and the sale of assets 
derivative instruments we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and a fourth interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  the three interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the fourth interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
it is expected that the term loan amount will not exceed the notional amount of the four interest rate swap agreements 
as of december  and  these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  changes in their fair values were reflected currently in earnings 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recognized a decrease of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
for the year ended december   we recognized an increase of million in interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements

as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified in other short term liabilities on our balance sheet 
debt and equity financing on november   our board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program 
we were authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private repurchases 
we completed this repurchase program in april we repurchased a total of million shares of class a common stock for million 
on april   our board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program 
we were authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private purchases 
as of december   we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we repurchased an additional million shares of our outstanding class a common stock at an average price of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million during the year ended december  we have repurchased a total of million shares of class a common stock for approximately million under both plans from inception through december  we are currently restricted from making future repurchases of shares of our common stock under the terms of our amended credit facility except under a limited circumstance  which we utilized in may and may utilize again in the future 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   the company s board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of repurchased class a common stock

consolidated adjusted ebitda consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined below decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  consolidated adjusted ebitda decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we define consolidated adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus loss gain on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include loss gain on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based 
table of contents compensation  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our syndicated bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the maximum allowed leverage ratio  maximum capital expenditures and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our syndicated bank credit facility 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio also affects the interest rate charged for revolving loans  thus affecting our interest expense 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  our maximum allowed leverage ratio may not exceed to the actual leverage ratio was as follows in each case as of december  to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into an amendment to our credit facility agreement in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used to make executive compensation decisions 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to cash flows from operating activities  its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  please see page cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash flow provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  although we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   we had positive cash flow from operations 
our net loss for the year ended december  was primarily a result of non cash expenses  including an impairment charge of million and depreciation and amortization expense of million 
our net loss of million for the year ended december  was also the result of non cash expenses  primarily impairment charges of million 
we expect to continue to have positive cash flow from operating activities for net cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash flow provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we spent million on net capital expenditures and million related to the acquisition of television assets in reno  nevada 
these capital expenditures were paid out of net cash flow from operations 
during the year ended december   we received million from the sale of our outdoor advertising business and spent million on net capital expenditures and million related to the acquisition of radio assets in orlando  florida 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be 
table of contents approximately million during the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
however  in order comply with the terms of our amended credit facility agreement  our capital expenditures may not exceed million in each of and under the terms of our amended credit facility agreement  we are restricted from making acquisitions and investments when the leverage ratio is greater than  which is the case at the present time 
net cash flow used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we made net debt payments of million  paid million in fees and expenses related to the amendment of our syndicated bank credit facility  repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for million including transaction fees and received net proceeds of million from the sale of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for million including transaction fees  repurchased million shares of our class u common stock for million  made net debt payments of million and received net proceeds of million from the sale of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan

in order to broadcast high definition programming in the future  we intend to begin construction at our studio control facilities in  and at our production control facilities in and we currently expect that the total cost of this high definition upgrade at our local studio and control facilities will be approximately million 
we intend to finance the high definition upgrade by using net cash flow from operations 
commitments and contractual obligations we have agreements with certain media research and ratings providers  expiring at various dates through december  to provide television and radio audience measurement services 
we lease facilities and broadcast equipment under various operating lease agreements with various terms and conditions  expiring at various dates through november our material contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years more than years syndicated bank credit facility and other borrowings and related interest media research and ratings providers operating leases and other material non cancelable contractual obligations total contractual obligations these amounts represent estimated future cash interest payments related to our syndicated bank credit facility and other borrowings 
future interest payments could differ materially from amounts indicated in the table due to future operational and financing needs  market factors and other currently unanticipated events 
please refer to syndicated bank credit facility amendments above for interest terms

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

sfas 
sfas made the fasb accounting standards codification asc  also known as the codification  the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  except for additional authoritative rules and interpretive releases issued by the sec 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by organizing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic within a consistent structure 
the codification was effective for our financial statements issued beginning in the quarter ending september  all accounting references have been updated  and therefore sfas references have been replaced with asc references 
goodwill we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
we test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if certain events or certain changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make a series of assumptions about such things as the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair values of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts 
we have determined that each of our operating segments is a reporting unit 
if a reporting unit s estimated fair value is equal to or greater than that reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists and the testing is complete at the first step 
however  if the reporting 
table of contents unit s carrying amount is greater than the estimated fair value  the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment of goodwill  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  then an impairment exists and an impairment loss is recorded for the amount of the difference 
as of december   we had million of goodwill in our television reporting unit and million of goodwill in our radio reporting unit 
the fair value of our television reporting unit was greater than the carrying value by 
therefore  we do not believe that we are at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test in our television reporting unit for at least the foreseeable future 
the fair value of our radio reporting unit was greater than the carrying value by 
if the fair value of our radio reporting unit is less than the carrying value in future periods  we would  at that time  have to proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment testing process 
the estimated fair value of goodwill is determined by using an income approach 
the income approach estimates fair value based on our estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of that reporting unit 
the income approach also requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as discount rates  revenue projections  profit margin projections and terminal value multiples 
we estimated our discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
these comparable publicly traded companies have similar size  operating characteristics and or financial profiles to us 
we also estimated the terminal value multiple based on comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
we estimated our revenue projections and profit margin projections based on internal forecasts about future performance 
the estimated fair value of the income approach is compared to a market approach for reasonableness 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying sales  earnings and cash flow multiples to each reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to our reporting units 
the market approach requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as selecting comparable companies and comparable transactions and transaction premiums 
the current economic conditions have led to a decrease in the number of comparable transactions  which makes the market approach of comparable transactions and transaction premiums more difficult to estimate than in previous years 
the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions potentially could have an adverse effect on the capital markets  which would affect the discount rate assumptions  terminal value estimates  transaction premiums and comparable transactions 
such economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations  which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
furthermore  such economic conditions could have a negative impact on the advertising industry in general or the industries of those customers who advertise on our stations  including  among others  the automotive  financial and other services  telecommunications  travel and restaurant industries  which in the aggregate provide a significant amount of our historical and projected advertising revenue 
the activities of our competitors  such as other broadcast television stations and radio stations  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
changes in technology or our audience preferences  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  such as internet  social media and broadband content providers serving the same markets  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
finally  the risk factors that we identify from time to time in our sec reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
given the uncertainties of the current economic environment and the impact it has had  and may continue to have  on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding 
table of contents internal forecasts of future performance of our business as a whole or of our units are not achieved  if market conditions change and affect the discount rate  or if there are lower comparable transactions and transaction premiums  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future change in our assumptions would have an adverse impact on our valuation models and result in impairment  or if it does  whether such impairment charge would be material 
indefinite life intangible assets we believe that our broadcast licenses are indefinite life intangible assets 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
the evaluation of impairment for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses represents all licenses owned and operated within an individual market cluster  because such licenses are used together  are complimentary to each other and are representative of the best use of those assets 
our individual market clusters consist of cities or nearby cities 
we test our broadcasting licenses for impairment based on certain assumptions about these market clusters 
we wrote down the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses in our radio reporting unit to fair value during our annual impairment test 
the fair value of the television broadcast licenses exceeded the carrying value by over so we did not have impairment of our television fcc licenses 
as is the case with determining the estimated fair value of goodwill  the estimated fair value of indefinite life intangible assets is also determined by an income approach 
the income approach estimates fair value based on our estimated future cash flows of each market cluster  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  which reflect the level of inherent risk 
the income approach also requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as discount rates  revenue projections  profit margin projections and terminal value multiples 
we estimate our discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
these comparable publicly traded companies have similar size  operating characteristics and or financial profiles to us 
we also estimated the terminal value multiple based on comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
we estimated our revenue projections and profit margin projections based on various market clusters signal coverage of the markets and industry information for an average station within a given market 
the information for each market cluster includes such things as estimated market share  estimated capital start up costs  population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned or actual conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions we make about cash flows after conversion are based on the performance of similar stations in similar markets and potential proceeds from the sale of the assets 
the estimated fair value of the income approach is compared to a market approach for reasonableness 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying sales  earnings and cash flow multiples to each market cluster s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable markets with similar operating characteristics of our market clusters 
the market approach requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as selecting comparable market clusters and comparable transactions and transaction premiums 
the current economic conditions have led to a decrease in the number of comparable transactions  which makes the market approach of comparable transactions and transaction premiums more difficult to estimate than in previous years 
the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions potentially could have an adverse effect on the capital markets  which would affect the discount rate assumptions  terminal value estimates  transaction premiums and comparable transactions 
such economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations  which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
furthermore  such economic conditions could have a negative impact 
table of contents on the advertising industry in general or the industries of those customers who advertise on our stations  including  among others  the automotive  financial and other services  telecommunications  travel and restaurant industries  which in the aggregate provide a significant amount of our historical and projected advertising revenue 
the activities of our competitors  such as other broadcast television stations and radio stations  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
changes in technology or our audience preferences  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  such as internet  social media and broadband content providers serving the same markets  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
finally  the risk factors that we identify from time to time in our sec reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
given the uncertainties of the current economic environment and the impact it has had  and may continue to have  on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding internal forecasts of future performance of our business as a whole or of our units are not achieved  if market conditions change and affect the discount rate  or if there are lower comparable transactions and transaction premiums  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future change in our assumptions would have an adverse impact on our valuation models and result in impairment  or if it does  whether such impairment charge would be material 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

table of contents revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contracts that we enter into directly with our advertisers is recorded at gross revenue and the related commission or national representation fee is recorded in operating expense 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
derivative instruments asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements is recorded at fair market value  including non performance risk  and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by using multiple broker quotes  adjusted for non performance risk  which estimate the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreements 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  as of december   these interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  the increase in fair value is classified as a reduction of interest expense on our statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized a decrease of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
for the year ended december   the company recognized an increase of million in interest expense related to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet

we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to asc  transfers and servicing 
the amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  therefore requiring these entities to be evaluated under the accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
other changes include additional considerations when determining if sale accounting is appropriate  as well as enhanced disclosures requirements 
this standard is effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to asc  consolidation 
the amendment eliminates the scope exception for qspes and requires an entity to reconsider its previous consolidation conclusions reached 
table of contents under the vie consolidation model  including i whether an entity is a vie  ii whether the enterprise is the vie s primary beneficiary  and iii the required financial statement disclosures 
the new standard can be applied as of the effective date  with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized on that date  or retrospectively  with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings recognized as of the beginning of the first year adjusted 
this standard is effective january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
television we conducted our annual review of our television reporting unit and determined that the fair value of our television reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
the fair value of the television reporting unit was primarily determined by evaluating discounted cash flow models and a market based approach 
the revenue projections and profit margin projections in the models are based on various market clusters signal coverage of the markets and industry information for an average station within a given market 
the information for each market cluster includes such things as estimated market share  estimated capital start up costs  population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned or actual conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion are based on the performance of similar stations in similar markets and potential proceeds from the sale of the assets 
the market based approach used comparable company earnings multiples 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our television reporting unit and fcc licenses  we used discounted cash flow models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
our estimates of future cash flows assume that our television segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in our television expenses  and therefore our television assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
radio we conducted our annual review of our radio reporting unit and determined that the fair value of our radio reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
the fair value of the radio reporting unit was primarily determined by evaluating discounted cash flow models 
the revenue projections and profit margin projections in the models are based on various market clusters signal coverage of the markets and industry information for an average station within a given market 
the information for each market cluster includes such things as estimated market share  estimated capital start up costs  population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures

in calculating the estimated fair value of our radio reporting unit and fcc licenses  we used discounted cash flow models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
our 
table of contents estimates of future cash flows assume that our radio segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in our radio expenses  and therefore our radio assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
based on the assumptions and estimates described above  we recognized impairment losses of million relating to radio fcc licenses in the fourth quarter of impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
however  since february  we have had four swap arrangements that convert the entire amount of our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
under our syndicated bank credit facility  if we exceed certain leverage ratios we would be required to enter into derivative financial instrument transactions  such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
our current policy prohibits entering into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rates our term loan bears interest at libor plus a margin of  for a total interest rate of at december  as of december   million of our term loan was outstanding 
our revolving facility bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our leverage 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million was available under the revolving facility for future borrowings 
our syndicated bank credit facility requires us to enter into interest rate agreements if our leverage exceeds certain limits as defined in our credit agreement 
as of december   we had three interest rate swap agreements with a million aggregate notional amount  with quarterly reductions  that expire on october   and one interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount  with quarterly increases  that also expires on october  the three interest rate swap agreements convert a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
the fourth interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation of  which includes a margin of 
it is expected that the term loan amounts will not exceed the notional amount of the four interest rate swap agreements 
we recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
as of december   our interest rate swap agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  the fair value was a liability of million and was classified as other current liabilities on our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   we recognized a decrease of million of interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we converted our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation at september  we currently anticipate that the aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements will equal our loan amount 
table of contents outstanding 
since we converted our variable rate term loan into a fixed rate obligation through october   an increase or decrease in the variable interest rate or our bank credit facility would not currently affect interest expense payments 
if the future interest yield curve decreases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will decrease and interest expense will increase 
if the future interest yield curve increases  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements will increase and interest expense will decrease
