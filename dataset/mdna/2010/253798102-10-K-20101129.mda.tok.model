item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in the communications technology industry  which is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
the market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants 
we compete for customers on the basis of existing and planned product features  service capabilities  company reputation  brand recognition  technical support  relationships with partners  quality and reliability  product development capabilities  price and availability 
we help customers connect  monitor  and control local or remote electronic devices over a network  via the internet or via satellite 
our revenues consist of products that are in non embedded and embedded product groupings 
the embedded products include modules  chips  software and development tools  single board computers  satellite communication products and engineering design services 
non embedded products include cellular routers  cellular gateway products  wireless communications adapters  serial servers  console servers  usb connected products  remote display products and serial cards 
our non embedded serial cards are in the mature phase of their product life cycles 
our strategy is to focus on key applications  customers and markets to efficiently manage the migration from products that are in the mature phase of their product life cycles to other newer technologies 
we experienced an increase in both revenue and profitability in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year as we partially recovered from the domestic economic downturn and benefited from actions taken in fiscal to position ourselves for growth 
our business was negatively impacted by the effects of the severe downturn in the economy in fiscal  and we experienced a reduction in demand for our products in all geographic locations 
in response to the depressed economic conditions  we put in place a restructuring plan that included various cost reduction actions 
we also reduced our investment in lower growth product lines while increasing our investment in wireless products and solutions that include hardware  software and services 
these actions allowed us to reduce our profit breakeven point and remain profitable despite the negative economic conditions that existed throughout fiscal net sales were million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
our wireless product net sales grew from million  or of net sales  in fiscal to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  an increase of 
we expect continued strength in wireless products net sales resulting from large customer opportunities for our wireless solutions  primarily in the smart grid  fleet management and medical markets 
gross profit increased by million  or in fiscal gross margin improved from for the fiscal year ended september  to for the fiscal year ended september  the business restructuring discussed above contributed to the improvement in our gross margin  in addition to other cost reduction initiatives 
total operating expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or

this was partially offset by a decrease of million in net sales of products included in our product portfolio resulting from the sarian acquisition which were higher in fiscal  primarily due to a large sale to a legacy customer  and a decrease of million in net sales due to large sales of a discontinued chip set in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily driven by increased volume and demand rather than pricing changes 
we did not experience a material change in revenue due to pricing 
as we continue to focus on growing our wireless sales  our wireless product net sales grew from million  or of net sales  in fiscal  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  or an increase of 
net sales were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
revenue decreased primarily due to weakened economic conditions and changes in product

non embedded products net sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due mostly to decreases in sales of serial cards  serial servers and usb connected products  partially offset by increases in cellular and wireless communication adapters 
non embedded net sales related to sarian branded products were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  which included five months of sarian net sales from the date of acquisition 
embedded embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net sales of modules and satellite related products  partially offset by a decrease of million primarily related to large sales of a discontinued chip set in fiscal embedded products net sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due mostly to decreases of modules and network interface cards  partially offset by an increase in chips and software

the increase in net sales in the distribution channel compared to the direct oem channel is primarily due to fulfillment of customer orders for wireless products 
the decreases in net sales in both the direct oem and the distribution channels during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from a weakened economy 
we continued to focus on maintaining our channel strategy  which includes employing additional channel partners and releasing complementary products 
net sales by geographic area our revenue by geographic location of our customers is as follows net sales of net sales in millions north america europe  middle east africa asian countries latin america total net sales net sales in fiscal increased million over fiscal as the us economy partially recovered from the domestic economic downturn

the increase in net sales in emea during fiscal and is primarily due to the acquisition of sarian in april  which provided revenue of million and million  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales continued revenue for the latin america and asian countries increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenue decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenue for fiscal for both latin america and asian countries was due to an increase of million of embedded products and million of non embedded products 
also in fiscal  we recorded a full year of net sales related to the mobiapps acquisition compared to three months of net sales in fiscal the decrease in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal for latin america was primarily due to a reduction in net sales of non embedded products and for asian countries was due to a reduction in net sales of both embedded and non embedded products primarily resulting from the global economic conditions in both regions 
mobiapps revenue of million from date of acquisition of june is included in fiscal asian countries revenue 
gross profit compared to gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the gross margin for fiscal was compared to in fiscal gross margin increased primarily due to a reduction of costs as a result of the business restructuring in fiscal and other cost reduction initiatives and also increased related to a reduction in amortization of purchased and core technology as some technology is fully amortized 
this was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin due to unfavorable product mix primarily related to cellular and certain embedded products 
amortization of purchased and core technology was million or of net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal compared to gross margin for fiscal was compared to for the decrease in gross margin is primarily a result of product and customer mix changes as we had a large sale to a legacy customer which generated a lower gross margin

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring on april  we announced a business restructuring to increase our focus on wireless products and solutions that include hardware  software and services 
the restructuring included the closing of an engineering facility in long beach  california  and the relocation and consolidation of the manufacturing facility in davis  california to our minnetonka  minnesota headquarters 
we paid a lease cancellation fee for one of the leased facilities in davis and had vacated the facility as of september  we continue to maintain non manufacturing activities at the remaining leased facility in davis  california 
as a result of these initiatives  during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge  which consisted of million for employee termination costs for positions and million for contract termination fees and other relocation costs 
all positions were vacated as of september  the employee termination costs included severance and the associated costs of continued medical benefits and outplacement services 
the other restructuring expenses included contract termination fees for non renewal of lease terms relating to one of the facilities in davis  california and relocation expenses for employees 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional million for an additional six months of continued medical benefits as a result of new healthcare legislation passed in december related to the aforementioned restructuring 
also during fiscal we reversed million of the restructuring accrual since costs associated with continued medical benefits and relocation were lower than expected 
acquired in process research and development sarian systems  ltd 
on april   we acquired sarian systems  ltd 
sarian 
prior to the acquisition  sarian was a privately held corporation 
sarian is located in the united kingdom and is a leader in the european wireless router market 
the total purchase price of million was for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of sarian

this net increase is due to an increase in net income of million and a net increase of million of other non cash items  offset by a decrease of million in deferred income taxes and a million decrease due to changes in working capital 
changes in working capital decreased cash flows by million primarily due to an million decrease in accounts receivable as the receivables balance increased due to higher revenue in september than in september inventory levels were approximately the same at september  and  however inventories decreased million at september  compared to this was offset by a net increase of million related to changes in accounts payable and a net increase of million related to changes in other assets and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a net decrease of million 
this net decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net income of million  and decreases of million related to an other than temporary impairment charge during fiscal  million in deferred income taxes  and million related to an in process research and development charge in fiscal this was partially offset by an increase of million of other non cash items and an increase of million due to changes in working capital

we expect positive cash flows from operations and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  cash generated from operations and our ability to secure debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations for the next twelve months and beyond 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  payments due by fiscal period less than in thousands total year years years thereafter operating leases deferred payments on acquisition total contractual cash obligations the operating lease agreements included above primarily relate to office space 
the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of september  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros  british pounds or japanese yen and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
we have not implemented a formal hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk

during fiscal  we acquired sarian for million  which was partially financed by an intercompany loan from both digi international inc for million and digi gmbh for million 
the digi gmbh intercompany loan for million was paid in march and the digi international inc million loan was converted to capital on october  the translation adjustments related to the million intercompany loan were recorded in other income  net within our consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting developments in march  the fasb financial accounting standards board issued an amendment to the accounting standards that provides guidance on criteria used to define a milestone and determines when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone can be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
in addition  certain disclosures related to the milestone method of revenue recognition will be required 
we adopted this provision on october  we do not expect this amendment to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards that provides guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue generating transaction where multiple deliverables exist  and for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables 
this guidance is expected to result in more multiple deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance 
this amendment is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year beginning october  we adopted this provision on october  we do not expect this amendment to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this standard clarifies the existing accounting guidance such that tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality shall be excluded from the scope of the software revenue recognition accounting standards 
accordingly  sales of these products may fall within the scope of other revenue recognition accounting standards or may now be within the scope of this standard and may require an allocation of the arrangement consideration for each element of the arrangement 
this amendment is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year beginning october  we adopted this provision on october  we do not expect this amendment to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of embedded and non embedded products to our distributors and direct end user oem customers  and to a small extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services and royalties 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at both september  and we also generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services and royalties 
revenue recognized resulting from such non product sales represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
our software development tools and development boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for software licenses  professional and engineering services and training is recognized upon performance  which includes delivery of a final product version and acceptance by the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued cash equivalents and marketable securities we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider factors including how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class  the performance of the issuer s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry  expected market volatility  analyst recommendations  the views of external investment managers  any news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the issuer operates 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these securities has occurred and is other than temporary  we would record a charge to other income expense 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectability of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at september  and million at september  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
once the new cost basis is established  the value is not increased with any changes in circumstances that would indicate an increase after the remeasurement 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of june  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
at june   our market capitalization was below the carrying value of our reporting unit 
however  our market capitalization plus our estimated control premium of resulted in a fair value in excess of our carrying value and therefore no impairment was indicated 
in order for our carrying value to equal fair value  we would have required approximately a control premium 
the control premium represents the amount an investor would pay  over and above market capitalization  in order to obtain a controlling interest in a company 
the estimated control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
at september   our market capitalization  which is an indicator of fair value  continued to be below the carrying value of our reporting unit  however  including the control premium there continued to be no indication of goodwill impairment at september  in order for our carrying value to equal fair value  we would have required approximately a control premium 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to our income tax balances that are material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we have unrecognized tax benefits of million classified as a long term liability as we do not expect significant payments to occur over the next months 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate is million 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
warranties in general  we warrant our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service 
the warranty periods range from one to five years from the date of receipt 
we have the option to repair or replace products we deem defective due to material or workmanship 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized based upon an estimated average per unit repair or replacement cost applied to the estimated number of units under warranty 
these estimates are based upon historical warranty incidents and are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure the adequacy of the warranty accrual 
the product warranty accrual was million at september  and million at september  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros  british pounds or japanese yen and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
we have not implemented a formal hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk 
during fiscal  the average monthly exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar increased by approximately from to  the average monthly exchange rate for the british pound to the us dollar increased approximately from to and the average monthly exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar increased by approximately from 
to 
a change from the average exchange rate for the euro  british pound and yen to the us dollar would have resulted in a increase or decrease in annual net sales and a increase or decrease in stockholders equity 
the above analysis does not take into consideration any pricing adjustments we may make in response to changes in the exchange rate 
credit risk we have some exposure to credit risk related to our accounts receivable portfolio 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through regular monitoring of customer financial status  credit limits and collaboration with sales management on customer contacts to facilitate payment 
investments are made in accordance with our investment policy and consist of certificates of deposit  corporate bonds and government bonds 
we may have some exposure related to the fair value of our securities  which could change significantly based on changes in market conditions 
if market conditions deteriorate  we may incur impairment charges for securities in our investment portfolio
