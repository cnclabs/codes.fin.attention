item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a specialized asset management company that uses industry specific expertise to evaluate  originate  service and manage investment opportunities in the commercial finance  real estate and financial fund management sectors 
as a specialized asset manager  we seek to develop investment funds for outside investors for which we provide asset management services  typically under long term management arrangements either through a contract with  or as the manager or general partner of  our sponsored investment funds 
we typically maintain an investment in the funds we sponsor 
assets under management have grown from billion at september  to billion at september  we limit our fund development and management services to asset classes where we own existing operating companies or have specific expertise 
we believe this strategy enhances the return on investment we can achieve for our funds 
in our real estate operations  we concentrate on the ownership  operation and management of multifamily and commercial real estate and real estate mortgage loans including whole mortgage loans  first priority interests in commercial mortgage loans  known as a notes  subordinated interests in first mortgage loans  known as b notes  mezzanine loans  investments in discounted and distressed real estate loans and investments in value added properties properties which  although not distressed  need substantia l improvements to reach their full investment potential 
in our commercial finance operations  we focus on originating small and middle ticket equipment leases and commercial loans secured by business essential equipment  including technology  commercial and industrial equipment and medical equipment 
in our financial fund management operations  we concentrate on trust preferred securities of banks  bank holding companies  insurance companies and other financial companies  bank loans and asset backed securities  or abs 
as a specialized asset manager  we are affected by conditions in the financial markets and  in particular  the continued volatility and reduced liquidity in the global credit markets which have reduced our revenues from  and the values of  many of the types of financial assets which we manage or own and have reduced our ability to access debt financing for our operations 
for fiscal  given the constraints imposed by current economic and market conditions  we expect to focus on managing our existing assets  which provides us with substantial fee income  and raising investor funds through our retail broker channel for investment programs  particularly in our real estate business 
in our real estate segment  we continue to redirect the focus f rom acquiring and managing performing multifamily assets to acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate related debt that has been significantly discounted due to the effects of the economic events and high levels of leverage 
in financial fund management  we continue to manage and receive fees from the collateralized debt obligation  or cdo  issuers that we had previously formed and sponsored  but do not expect to sponsor any new cdo issuers 
in our commercial finance segment  we have reduced our originations during fiscal in conjunction with the reduced availability of debt financing 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we sold approximately million of leases and loans to our affiliate  resource capital corp  or rcc  and recognized a loss of million 
the proceeds of the sale were primarily used to pay off and terminate our warehouse credit facility with pnc bank  na in september  we obtained a million short term bridge loan matures in february in order to originate leases and loans 
we are in the process of seeking longer term financing for future lease and loan originations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing in sufficient amounts to resume our prior origination volumes  upon acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  during fiscal  four of our commercial finance investment entities reduced their equity distributions to their partners as a result of the impact of the recession on the cash flow of these entities 
as a result  we waived million of management fees from these funds and recorded a million reserve for doubtful accounts on amounts owed to us 
we anticipate waiving these management fees in the future  which will accordingly reduce our revenues 
principally as a result of these charges  we recorded a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million in fiscal as compared to net losses attributable to common shareholders of million and million for fiscal and  respectively

results of operations real estate during fiscal  we continue to redirect the focus of our real estate subsidiary  resource real estate  inc  from acquiring and managing performing multifamily assets to a acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate and real estate related debt that have been significantly discounted due to the effects of economic events and high levels of leverage and b managing existing assets for our real estate programs 
in december  we closed resource real estate opportunity fund lp  a limited partnership  which invests in discounted real estate and real estate related debt  after raising a total of million 
additionally  we formed resource real estate opportunity reit  inc  or rre opportunity reit  which w ill further invest in discounted commercial real estate and real estate related debt 
the registration statement for this fund became effective in june for fiscal  our primary fundraising efforts will be focused on the rre opportunity reit 
through our real estate segment  we focus on four different areas the acquisition  ownership and management of portfolios of discounted real estate and real estate related debt  which we have acquired through two sponsored real estate investment entities as well as through joint ventures with institutional investors  the sponsorship and management of real estate investment entities that principally invest in multifamily housing  the management  principally for rcc  of general investments in commercial real estate debt  including first mortgage debt  whole loans  mortgage participations  b notes  mezzanine debt and related commercial real estate securities  and to a lesser extent  the management and resolution of a portfolio of real estate loans and property interests that we acquired at various times between and  which we collectively refer to as our legacy portfolio

we support our real estate investment funds by making long term investments in them 
in addition  from time to time  we make bridge investments in the funds to facilitate acquisitions 
we record losses on these equity method investments primarily as a result of depreciation and amortization expense recorded by the property interests 
as additional investors are admitted to the funds  we sell our bridge investment back to our funds at our original cost and recognize a gain approximately equal to the previously recognized loss

revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from our real estate operations increased million to million for fiscal from million in fiscal we attribute the increase primarily to the following management fees a  increase in asset management fees due to an increase in equity deployed in properties in our investment entities  primarily the assets acquired by resource real estate opportunity fund  lp a  increase in property management fees earned by resource residential  reflecting the unit increase in multifamily units under management to  units at september  from  at september   and a million increase in reit management fees from rcc as a result of an increase in incentive management fees and in equity capital upon which our base management fee is calculated resulting from rcc s success in raising capital through common stock offerings

during fiscal  we earned fees from the acquisition of six distressed notes for million and four property acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of million  as compared to the acquisition of seven properties with an aggregate purchase price of million during fiscal since we do not place financing on our distressed note acquisitions  the decrease is primarily attributable to the reduction in debt placement fees for the properties we acquired in fiscal as compared to fiscal  a  decrease in rental property income and revenues of consolidated vies due to the sale of a consolidated vie interest in january  a  decrease in interest income attributable to the payoff of one loan in june book value of million  a million increase in gains and fees on the resolution of loans and other property interests

results of operations commercial finance during fiscal  we focused our efforts on improving the financial condition of our commercial finance segment primarily by terminating debt that had unfavorable terms by selling investments  lowering our overhead expenses by eliminating operating redundancies following the integration of our fiscal acquisitions  and reducing staff in conjunction with the reduced origination capabilities brought on by the recession and tight debt markets 
as asset managers for our investment partnerships  our goal is to preserve partnership capital and to achieve the best possible results for those investors 
in fiscal  we took the following actions on behalf of those investment partnerships ceased raising new funds when it became apparent that the debt markets were not improving rapidly enough  deferred expense reimbursement to us  for fiscal  we waived million of our asset management fees for our sponsored leasing partnerships  and anticipate that we will continue to waive our fees in the future which  accordingly  will reduce our revenues 
we believe that  as a result  cash flow in these partnerships will improve significantly  which will help pay down loans and generate liquidity for investments in new leases  negotiated with the partnerships lenders to keep them from foreclosing on partnership collateral  and paid down existing debt and reduced exposure with lenders that had unfavorable terms in part by completing three securitizations in fiscal totaling million 
during fiscal  our commercial finance assets under management decreased million to million as compared to billion in fiscal originations of new equipment financing decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our originations have been and we expect they will continue to be impacted by the state of the credit markets and the reduced ability of our managed investment entities to obtain financing to acquire portfolios of leases and loans from us 
during fiscal  we sold approximately million of our portfolio of leases and loans to rcc 
in connection with the sale  the balance on the pnc bank warehouse line of credit used to acquire these leases and loans was repaid and the line was terminated 
as a result  we expect that our commercial finance revenues will continue to decline due to the reduction in the size of the portfolio of leases and loans that we originate and hold on our balance sheet prior to selling them to our investment entities and to rcc 
the commercial finance assets we managed for our own account during fiscal decreased by million to million as compared to million during fiscal  reflecting the reduction in our warehouse borrowings and the sale of commercial finance assets to rcc and our investment entities 
the assets we managed for others during fiscal decreased by million to million from billion at september  reflecting primarily the decrease in assets acquired by us and purchased by our investment entities due to the lack of available financing 
as of september   we managed approximately  leases and loans that had an average original finance value of  with an average term of months as compared to approximately  leases and loans with an average original finance value of  and an average term of months as of september  in march  two of the public equipment leasing partnerships we sponsored and manage formed a joint venture 
the joint venture subsequently acquired a portion of our interest in leaf commercial finance fund  llc  or lcff  an investment fund we formed to acquire and finance leases and loans we originate 
as a result of the transaction  lcff became a vie for which the joint venture was determined to be the primary beneficiary and  therefore  we ceased to consolidate lcff as of march  accordingly  a total of million of commercial finance assets and million of debt financing were transferred to the joint venture and removed from our financial statements 

back to index 
back to index the following table sets forth information related to commercial finance assets we manage in millions september  managed for our own account managed for others leaf investment entities rcc other for information on how we calculate assets under management  see item  business assets under management 
the revenues from our commercial finance operations historically have consisted primarily of finance revenues from leases and loans held by us prior to being sold  asset acquisition fees which we earn when commercial finance assets are sold to one of our investment partnerships and asset management fees we earn over the life of the leases or loans after sale to our investment partnerships 
we expect that our revenues will continue to decline until we are able to access financing on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain replacement financing will continue to limit our ability to originate new leases and loans and further reduce operations 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the revenues recognized and costs an d expenses incurred in our commercial finance operations in thousands years ended september  revenues finance revenues acquisition fees fund management fees equity in losses of unconsolidated partnerships other costs and expenses wages and benefit costs other costs and expenses total revenues include rcc servicing and origination fees of  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased million from million for fiscal as compared million for fiscal we attribute these decreases primarily to the following a million decrease in commercial finance revenues during fiscal the decreases were caused by the reduction in the size of the portfolio of commercial finance assets managed for our own account primarily due to the sale to rcc  a million decrease in asset acquisition fees during fiscal the difficulty in obtaining and maintaining debt financing by the investment funds we manage has limited their ability to acquire equipment financings from us 
consequently  we have reduced our commercial finance originations to match their asset acquisition capabilities  a million decrease in management fees during fiscal our management fees include fees we receive to service the commercial finance assets we manage  offering fees earned for raising capital in our investment entities as well as fees received for originating loans for those entities 
the decline in fund management fees during fiscal was caused primarily by a waiver of the fees we earn to manage the commercial finance assets  lower offering fees received as leaf equipment finance fund  our most recently sponsored investment entity  closed its offering in october  and finally  due to the lower fees as a result of the previously discussed reduction in the portfolio of leases and loans held by our investment entities 
a  increase in equity losses during fiscal  reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses recorded by our investment entities 
the negative impact of the economic recession in the united states on the ability of our investment funds customers to make payments on their leases and loans  has accordingly  increased our exposure from non performing assets  and 
back to index 
back to index other income decreased  during fiscal principally due to the decrease in customer service charges 
these fees typically vary widely from period to period and are driven by the amount and seasoning of commercial finance assets held by us 
costs and expenses fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses from our commercial finance operations decreased by million for fiscal we attribute this decrease primarily to the following a million reduction in wage and benefit costs during fiscal in response to lower origination volume and assets under management  we have reduced payroll and other overhead costs and have continued to eliminate redundant positions 
in total  we have reduced the number of full time employees in our commercial finance operations by to at september  from at september   and a reduction in other costs and expenses of million during fiscal the decrease reflects the reduction in costs  primarily legal  to service our smaller portfolio of assets  as well as our ongoing cost saving and consolidation efforts which targeted eliminating overhead redundancies and increasing operating efficiencies 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we attribute these decreases primarily to the following a million decrease in commercial finance revenues 
in fiscal  we held a significantly higher portfolio balance of leases and loans as a result of the million netbank portfolio acquired in november and held by us until being completely sold in april in addition  as of march  we no longer consolidated lcff  a million portfolio 
as a result of the deconsolidation of lcff  our finance revenues significantly decreased  offset in part by million of management fees earned after deconsolidation 
for the period subsequent to the deconsolidation march to september  lcff generated million of revenues which  because lcff was no longer consolidated with us  were not recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
similarly  we did not record lcff s costs and expenses which aggregated million in addition to million of interest expense  a million decrease in acquisition fees resulting from the billion decrease in the amount of leases sold to our funds and rcc to million 
this decrease reflects the portfolio acquisitions we sold to our investment entities in fiscal additionally  the difficulty in obtaining debt financing by our investment funds has limited their ability to acquire equipment financings from us 
consequently  we have reduced our commercial finance originations to match the asset acquisition capabilities of our funds  an  increase in fund management fees 
our management fees include fees we receive to service the commercial finance assets we manage  offering fees earned for raising capital in our investment entities as well as fees received for originating loans for those entities 
during fiscal  management fees earned to service leases increased by  due to the growth in assets under management created by the billion of lease originations in fiscal these increases were offset  in part  by decreased offering fees of  related to the time between the closing of one investment fund and the opening of another investment fund 
in addition  during fiscal  we waived  of fund management fees in one of our investment entities when we reduced that entity s monthly cash distribution to its partners  and a  decrease in other income  primarily due to reduction in late fees derived from commercial finance assets held by us 
these fees typically vary widely from period to period and are driven by the amount and seasoning of commercial finance assets held by us 
the large decrease in fiscal was due to the sale of the well seasoned netbank portfolio in fiscal costs and expenses fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses from our commercial finance operations decreased by million for fiscal we attribute this decrease primarily to a million reduction in wages and benefits 
our costs have decreased due to several factors i in fiscal  we held significantly higher assets and accordingly  incurred higher servicing costs  ii for fiscal  many of these costs were reimbursed by the investment entities to whom we have sold these assets  and iii in conjunction with converting the operations we acquired in fiscal onto the leaf platform  we have reduced overhead costs by eliminating redundant positions 
furthermore  in response to the ongoing recession and reduced originations  we have increased collection and customer service staff  while to a greater extent  we have decreased sales  credit and lease processing staff 
in total  we reduced the number of full time employees in our commercial finance operations by to as of september  from at september   and 
back to index 
back to index a million reduction in other costs and expenses 
this decrease is due to the decline in assets managed for our own account  which resulted in reduced costs to service our portfolio  primarily legal costs  and to our ongoing cost saving and consolidation efforts 
these efforts targeted eliminating overhead redundancies occurring through our acquisitions and taking advantage of efficiencies obtained by operating on a single platform 
in addition  fiscal included costs related to the portfolio acquisitions we made  which did not recur in fiscal results of operations financial fund management general

these fees vary by cdo issuer  with our annual fees ranging between and of the aggregate principal balance of the eligible collateral owned by the cdo issuers 
cdo indentures require the maintenance of certain overcollateralization test ratios  or o c ratios  which measure the ratio of assets collateral to liabilities notes of a given cdo issuer 
losses incurred on collateral due to payment defaults  payment deferrals or rating agency downgrades reduce the o c ratios 
if o c ratios are not met  incentive or subordinate management fees  which are discussed in the following sections  are deferred and interest collections from collateral are appl ied to outstanding principal note balances 
management fees we receive fees for managing the assets held by our company sponsored partnerships and credit opportunities fund 
these fees vary by limited partnership  with our annual fee ranging between and of the partnership capital balance 
based on the terms of our general partner interests  two of the trapeza partnerships we manage as general partner include a clawback provision 
we discuss the basis for our fees and revenues for each area in more detail in the following sections 
our financial fund management operations have depended upon our ability to sponsor cdo issuers and sell their cdos 
although we continue to manage and receive fees from cdo issuers that we formed and sponsored  we do not expect to sponsor any new cdo issuers as a result of current conditions in the global credit markets 
accordingly  we expect that these management fee revenues will continue to decline

these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in rcc management fees primarily due to an increase in incentive management fees and in rcc s equity capital upon which our base management fee is calculated resulting primarily from rcc s success in raising capital through common stock offerings  a  increase in management and incentive fees earned on separate managed accounts

back to index 
back to index costs and expenses fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses of our financial fund management operations increased  in fiscal this increase was principally due to a million increase in commission expense incurred in connection with certain trust preferred security transactions  a million increase in legal and consulting expenses primarily relating to an unsuccessful bank transaction and a  increase in equity compensation expense due to an adjustment related to previously issued rcc restricted stock and options awarded to members of management 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in compensation million  financial software  and rent expense  as a result of a reduction in asset management and support personnel reflecting our efforts to realign costs with exi sting operations 
revenues fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we attribute the increase primarily to the following a million decrease in fund and rcc management fees  primarily from the following a million net decrease in collateral management fees from our ischus operations primarily due to a reduction in subordinated management fees as a result of an increase in rating agency downgrades which reduced our collateral base and the liquidation of two of our cdo issuers during fiscal  a million net decrease in senior  subordinated and incentive management fees from our trapeza operations  primarily from the following a million decrease in subordinated management fees 
during fiscal and  we recorded subordinated management fees of  and million  respectively  on cdo issuers 
the loss recorded during fiscal was primarily the result of the write off of cumulative accrued subordinated management fees that we no longer expect to receive from nine cdo issuers  and a  decrease in senior management fees as a result of portfolio defaults which reduced our collateral base 
these decreases were partially offset by an  decrease in our share of expenses for the management of trapeza capital management llc and trapeza management group llc  primarily due to a decrease in asset management personnel and state taxes  and a  increase in incentive management fees 
during fiscal  we wrote off  in incentive management fees from two cdo issuers as compared to a write off of  of similar fees from three cdo issuers during fiscal a  decrease in management fees from other company sponsored partnerships primarily due to the liquidation of our previously sponsored hedge fund and a decline in fair values of other company sponsored partnership investments 
these management fees are net asset based  and a  decrease in collateral management fees from the european cdo issuer we manage due to a decrease in the euro to dollar exchange rate 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in collateral management fees resulting from a full year of fees on four bank loan cdo issuers whose management we assumed from an unaffiliated third party asset manager in may  and a  increase in rcc management fees and equity compensation  reflecting a  increase in management fees and a  increase in equity compensation

our ability to meet our liquidity needs will be subject to our ability to generate cash from operations  and  with respect to our investments  our ability to raise investor funds and to obtain debt financing 
however  the availability of any such financing will depend on market conditions which  as we discuss in overview  continues to be subject to substantial volatility and reduced availability 
we also may seek to obtain liquidity through the disposition of non strategic investments  including our legacy portfolio 
in general  if we are unable to renew  replace or expand our sources of financing on acceptable terms  or raise investor funds which may depend  in part  on our ability to obtain financing for the investment entities we sponsor  we may be unable to implement our investment strategies successfully and may be required to liquidate portfolio investments other than non strategic investments to generate liquidity 
any sale of portfolio investments could be at prices lower than the carrying value of such investments  which could result in losses and reduced income 
moreover  even if we are able to renew or replace our facilities  the interest rate we are able to obtain  and the other costs of those facilities  may be materially higher than those previously ava ilable to us  which could reduce our net revenues and earnings 
also  if we cannot expand our overall financing capacity under those facilities or add new facilities  or if we are unable to raise other funds  including third party investments in our investment funds  our ability to expand the amount of assets we own or which are under management will be limited  and our ability to increase net revenues and earnings will be impaired 
at september   our liquidity consisted of two primary sources cash on hand of million  and cash generated from operations  including asset and property management fees as well as payments received on leases and loans  sales of equipment and the continued resolution of our real estate legacy portfolio 
in october  we completed our private placement offering of three year senior notes and generated million in cash 
we used a portion of the offering proceeds to pay down our corporate line of credit borrowings under the td bank facility 
in november  we amended the td bank facility to provide additional flexibility and reduce our debt costs 
in particular  the amendment lowered the minimum interest rate on borrowings  reinstated the libor rate option on borrowings  lowered the required monthly principal paydowns from  to  and extended the facility term to october we anticipate that we will be able to extend this facility

borrowings outstanding decreased million from million at september  the decrease primarily reflects the million reduction in leaf s borrowings on the pnc warehouse facility  offset in part by million in bridge financing 
the tight credit market continues to limit the ability of leaf and its investment entities to obtain debt financing and  as such  reduces its opportunitie s to grow our commercial finance business 
in may  the million of outstanding borrowings with pnc bank were repaid and the warehouse facility was closed 
in september  leaf obtained a million six month bridge loan to purchase leases and loans 
the facility matures on february  until we are able to secure long term financing  leaf expects that it will continue to monitor and scale back its commercial finance business to accommodate the current lack of availability of debt financing to it and its investment entities  including  if necessary  the sale of portfolio assets 
failure to obtain replacement financing will continue to limit our ability to originate new leases and loans and further reduce operations 
in any such event  our commercial finance business could incur losses which could be significant 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we sold approximately million of leases and loans to rcc 
in connection with these sales  we are obligated to repurchase or provide replacement leases and loans for up to a maximum of approximately million of delinquent assets 
furthermore  we may defer or discount our fees from our investment entities based upon current economic conditions 
in certain circumstances  we may also waive all or part of these fees based upon required priority distributions to our investors 
based on changes in the projected cash distributions to be made to the limited partners of one of our managed partnerships  we determined that we will not be able to collect our management fees for the leaf investment entities for fiscal and  accordingly  recorded a provision of million 
our legacy real estate portfolio at september  consisted of six property interests and two loans

because of current economic conditions  the amount of cash we may be able to derive from resolution of our remaining legacy portfolio and other non strategic investments in the future may be limited  in any event  the amount of cash we may derive from them is subject to significant variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our remaining legacy portfolio will be a source of significant ongoing cash generation 
capital requirements our capital needs consist principally of funds to make investments in the investment vehicles we sponsor or for our own account and to provide bridge financing or other temporary financial support to facilitate asset acquisitions by our sponsored investment vehicles

our obligation runs through december  in addition  we agreed to partially indemnify the purchaser of the loan for a portion of the difference between ordinary income tax rates and capital gain rates on accrued interest on the note between the date of sale of the loan in march and december  to date  we have not been required to make any payments resulting from these agreements 
we are also committed to invest of the equity raised by rre opportunity reit to a maximum amount of million 
general corporate commitments 
as a specialized asset manager  we sponsor investment funds in which we may make an equity investment along with outside investors 
this equity investment is generally based on a percentage of funds raised and varies among investment programs 
we are also party to employment agreements with certain executives that provide for compensation and other benefits  including severance payments under specified circumstances 
as of september   except for the clawback liability recorded for the two trapeza entities  the reserve for lease and loan repurchase commitment and executive compensation  we do not believe it is probable that any payments will be required under any of our commitments and contingencies  and accordingly  no liabilities for these obligations have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we make estimates of our allowance for credit losses  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  discounts and collectability of management fees  the valuation of stock based compensation  servic ing liability and repurchase obligation  allowance for lease and loan losses  and in determining whether a decrease in the fair value of an investment is an other than temporary impairment 
significant estimates for the commercial finance segment include the unguaranteed residual values of leased equipment  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and the fair value and effectiveness of interest rate swaps 
the financial fund management segment makes assumptions in determining the fair value of our investments in securities available for sale and in estimating the liability  if any  for clawback provisions on certain of our partnership interests 
we used assumptions  specifically inputs to the black scholes pricing model and the discounted cash flow model  in computing the fair value of the senior notes and warrants 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe rea sonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
stock based compensation employee stock options 
we expense employee option grants over the respective vesting periods  based on the estimated fair value of the award as determined on the date of grant 
restricted common stock 
we value the restricted stock we issue based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant and amortize this cost to compensation expense over the respective vesting period

back to index loans real estate loans 
real estate loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at the amount of unpaid principal  reduced by unearned income and an allowance for credit losses  if necessary 
these loans are included in investments in real estate in the consolidated balance sheets 
interest on these loans is calculated based upon the principal amount outstanding 
accrual of interest is stopped on a loan when management believes  after considering economic factors  business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s fina ncial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
an impaired real estate loan may remain on accrual status during the period in which we are pursuing repayment of the loan  however  the loan is placed on non accrual status at such time as either i management believes that contractual debt service payments will not be met  ii the loan becomes days delinquent  and iii management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts toward  curing the cause of the impairment 
while on non accrual status  we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received 
loans are charged off after being on non accrual for a period of one year 
we maintain an allowance for real estate loans at a level deemed sufficient to absorb probable losses 
we consider general and local economic conditions  the financial condition of our borrowers and  with respect to properties underlying our loans  neighborhood values  competitive overbuilding  and casualty losses as well as other factors that may affect the value of real estate loans 
the value of loans and real estate may also be affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations and liability under applicable environmental laws  changes in interest rates and the availability of financing 
income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms 
we review all credits on a quarterly basis  continually monitor collections and payments from our borrowers and maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon our historical experience and our knowledge of specific borrower collection issues 
we reduce our investments in real estate loans and real estate by an allowance for amounts that may become unrealizable in the future 
investments in commercial finance our investments in commercial finance consist primarily of loans  direct financing leases and operating leases 
we reflected those investments that we are holding for sale to our investment entities separately at fair value as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
loans 
for term loans  the investment consists of the sum of the total future minimum loan payments receivable less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess of the total future minimum contracted payments over the original cost of the loan 
for all other loans  interest income is recorded at the stated rate on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
direct financing leases 
certain of our lease transactions are accounted for as direct financing leases as distinguished from operating leases 
such leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
our investment in direct financing leases consists of the sum of the total future minimum contracted payments receivable and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of leased equipment  less unearned finance income 
unearned finance income  which is recognized as revenue over the term of the financing by the effective interest method  represents the excess o f the total future minimum lease payments plus the estimated unguaranteed residual value expected to be realized at the end of the lease term over the cost of the related equipment 
initial direct costs incurred in the consummation of the lease are capitalized as part of the investment in lease receivables and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of the yield 
we discontinue recognizing revenue for leases and loans for which payments are more than days past due 
fees from delinquent payments are recognized when received 
operating leases 
leases not meeting any of the criteria to be classified as direct financing leases are deemed to be operating leases 
under the accounting for operating leases  the cost of the leased equipment  including acquisition fees associated with lease placements  is recorded as an asset and depreciated on a straight line basis over the equipment s estimated useful life  generally up to seven years 
rental income consists primarily of monthly periodic rental payments due under the terms of the leases 
we recognize rental income on a straight line basis 
during the lease term of existing operating leases  we may not recover all of the cost and related expenses of our rental equipment and  therefore  we are prepared to remarket the equipment in future years 
our policy is to review  on at least a quarterly basis  the expected economic life of our rental equipment in order to determine the recoverability of our undepreciated cost 
we write down our rental equipment to estimated net realizable value when it is probable that our carrying amount exceeds such value and the excess can be reasonably estimated  gains are only recognized upon actual sale of the rental equipment 
there were no write downs of equipment during fiscal  and

in fiscal  the entire portfolio of future payment card receivables was put on the cost recovery method of accounting whereby no income is recognized until the basis of the future payment card receivable has been fully recovered 
allowance for credit losses 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in commercial finance including investments in leases and loans and future payment card receivables based upon  among other factors  management s historical experience with the commercial finance portfolios it manages  an analysis of contractual delinquencies  economic conditions and trends  industry statistics and equipment finance portfolio characteristics  as adjusted for expected recoveries 
in evaluating historic performance of leases and loans  we perform a migration analysis  which estimates the likelihood that an acc ount progresses through delinquency stages to ultimate write off 
we fully reserve  net of recoveries  all leases and loans after they are days past due 
additionally  we review the collectability of our receivables from managed entities 
we have estimated that based on current projections  one of the commercial finance funds will not have sufficient funds to pay a portion of its accrued management fees to us as of september  accordingly  we recorded a provision of million in fiscal with a corresponding reduction to the receivables from managed entities 
investments in commercial finance assets held for sale 
commercial finance assets  which we do not have the intent to hold until maturity  are classified as commercial finance assets held for sale 
these investments  which primarily consist of loans and direct financing leases  are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
cost basis includes deferred origination fees and costs 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flow models 
investment securities our investment securities available for sale  including our investments in cdo issuers we sponsor  which are owned directly are carried at fair value 
the fair value of these cdo investments is based primarily on internally generated expected cash flow models that require significant management judgment and estimation due to the lack of market activity and unobservable pricing inputs 
our investments in affiliates  including holdings in tbbk and rcc  are valued at the closing price of the respective stock 
the fair value of the cumulative net unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities  net of tax  are reported through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on the sale of inv estments are determined on the basis of specific identification and are included in results of operations 
we recognize a realized loss when it is probable there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows of the security holder from what had been previously estimated 
the security is then written down to fair value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of current earnings 
the cost basis adjustment for other than temporary impairment would be recoverable only upon the sale or maturity of the security 
periodically  we review the carrying value of our available for sale securities 
if we deem an unrealized loss to be other than temporary  we will record an impairment charge 
our process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors 
these factors include i the duration of a significant decline in value  ii the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  iii the magnitude of the decline  iv the collateral structure and other credit support  as applicable  and v our more than likely intention to hold the investment until the value recovers 
when the analysis of the above factors results in a conclusion that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value 
our trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings and reported in other income  net 
we value these securities using quoted market prices 
we recognize dividend income on securities classified as available for sale on the ex dividend date 
accounting for income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 

back to index 
back to index the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effects of tax rate changes on deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets  as well as other changes in income tax laws  are recognized in net earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted 
the future realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we continually evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating re sults  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless we determine that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
servicing and repurchase liabilities we routinely sell our investments in commercial finance assets held for sale to our affiliated leasing partnerships and rcc  as well as to third parties 
leases and loans are accounted for as sold when control of the lease is surrendered 
control over the leases is deemed surrendered when the leases have been transferred to the leasing partnership  rcc or third party  the buyer has the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right to pledge or exchange the leases and we do not maintain effective control over the leases through either a an agreement that entitles and obligates us to repurchase or redeem the leases before maturity  or b the ability to unilaterally cause the buyer to return spe cific leases 
subsequent to these sales  we typically remain as the servicer for the leases and loans sold for which we generally receive a servicing fee of approximately of the book value of the serviced portfolio 
the assets and liabilities associated with the respective servicing agreements are typically not material and are offsetting and  accordingly  are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  however  we sold a portfolio of leases and loans to rcc with servicing retained for which we will not be receiving any servicing fees 
accordingly  we recorded a million liability for the present value of the estimated cost to service the portfolio 
additionally  rcc has the option to return  and we have the obligation to repurchase  up to a maximum of approximately million in delinquent leases and loans as specified in the sale agreement 
in conjunction with this option  we recorded a million estimated liability based on historical default rates 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  a review for impairment is performed at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to our carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step two is completed to measure the amount of impairment  i f any 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is computed by subtracting the sum of the fair values of the individual asset categories tangible and intangible from the indicated fair value of the reporting unit as determined under step one 
an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we utilize several approaches  including discounted expected cash flows  market approach and comparable sales transactions to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit for our impairment review of goodwill 
these approaches require assumptions and estimates of many critical factors  including revenue and market growth  operating cash flows  market multiples  and discount rates  which are based on the current economic environment and credit market conditions 
our commercial finance operating segment has goodwill of million  which is tested annually on may st for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the commercial finance operations incurred significant losses  inclusive of the write off of the customer related intangible asset as discussed below and the waiver of management fees from its investment entities 
accordingly  we determined that a triggering event had occurred and performed  as of september   an interim assessment of goodwill for impairment at the commercial finance reporting unit 
based on a third party valuation as of may  as well as test results that were internally generated as of september  as a result of the triggering event in the fourth quarter  we concluded that there has been no impairment of our goodwill 

back to index 
back to index long lived assets and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we acquired customer relationships with third party originators  classified as a customer related intangible asset 
the value of the intangible asset consisted of the estimated excess of future cash inflows over the related cash outflows generated by the acquired customer base and relationships with third party originators 
we had been amortizing the intangible asset over the expected useful life of the asset and continually monitored events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
due to the elimination of the management fees from the leaf investment partnerships  there is no future expected benefit to be derived from the intangible asset 
therefore  the customer list became entirely impaired and  accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss for the entire carrying balance of million as of september  recent accounting standards accounting standard issued but not yet effective the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has issued the following accounting standards which are not yet effective for us as of september  transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb amended prior guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the new pronouncement changes the derecognition guidance for the transferors of financial assets  eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities and requires additional disclosures about all transfers of financial assets 
this guidance will be effective for us in fiscal we do not anticipate that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses in july  the fasb issued guidance that will require companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including  but not limited to  significant purchases and sales of financing receivables  aging information and credit quality indicators 
we will provide the required disclosure in our first fiscal quarter of variable interest entities or vies in june  the fasb issued guidance to revise the approach to determine when a vie should be consolidated 
the new consolidation model for vies considers whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and shares in the significant risks and rewards of the entity 
the guidance on vies requires companies to continually reassess vies to determine if consolidation is appropriate and to provide additional disclosures 
this guidance will be effective for us in fiscal we have determined that this guidance will not have a significant effect on our consolida ted financial statements and will make the necessary vie disclosures 
newly adopted accounting principles we adopted the following accounting standards during fiscal subsequent events 
in february  the fasb issued guidance which removes the requirement to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
this guidance was effective upon issuance 
fair value measurements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the new pronouncement requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
in addition  it clarifies the requirements of the following existing disclosures disclosures regard ing the need to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities  and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the new guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements which will be effective for us in fiscal our adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

back to index 
back to index participating securities 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which requires nonvested equity awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  or participating securities  to be included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
we have  accordingly  adjusted all historical earnings per share data presented 
noncontrolling interests 
in december  the fasb established accounting and reporting guidance for a noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary which requires that the noncontrolling interest be reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and that net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income loss attributable to common shareholders be presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of fiscal  by reclassifying noncontrolling interests as a separate component of equity and recording losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests even when the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest has been reduced to zero 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to various market risks from changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage this risk through regular operating and financing activities 
we have not entered into any market sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
the range of changes presented reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period and provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
the following analyzes the potential impact of a hypothetical change in interest rates as of september  our analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
corporate at september   we have a secured revolving credit facility which is for general business use 
weighted average borrowings on this facility were million for fiscal at an effective interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate on this facility would change our annual interest expense by  our million of senior notes are at fixed rates of interest and  therefore  are not subject to fluctuation 
commercial finance we hold commercial finance assets which are comprised of loans and leases at fixed rates of interest 
to finance these assets  we obtained a million short term bridge facility at a fixed rate of interest 
we are seeking a new longer term facility in which the rate may differ from our current facility 
foreign exchange rate risk we have not entered into any forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency rate risk because we do not believe our foreign exchange exposure is material
