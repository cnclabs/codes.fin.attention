contract provisions and subcontracting most of our revenue is derived from engineering  construction and epc contracts 
the majority of our contracts fall into the following basic categories firm fixed price or lump sum fixed price contracts  providing for a single price for the total amount of work or for a number of fixed lump sums for the various work elements comprising the total price  cost plus fixed fee contracts where income is earned solely from the fee received  unit price contracts  which specify a price for each unit of work performed  time and materials contracts where personnel and equipment are provided under an agreed upon schedule of daily rates with other direct costs being reimbursable  and a combination of the above including lump sum payment for certain items and unit rates for others 
changes in scope of work are subject to change orders to be agreed upon by both parties 
change orders not agreed to in either scope or price result in claims to be resolved in a dispute resolution process 
these change orders and claims can affect our contract revenue either positively or negatively 
we usually obtain contracts through either competitive bidding or negotiations with long standing clients 
we are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by our clients who maintain approved bidder lists 
bidders are pre qualified by virtue of their prior performance for such clients  as well as their experience  reputation for quality  safety record  financial strength and bonding capacity 
in evaluating bid opportunities  we consider such factors as the client and their geographic location  the difficulty of the work  current and projected workload  the likelihood of additional work  the project s cost and profitability estimates  and our competitive advantage relative to other likely bidders 
we give careful thought and consideration to the political and financial stability of the country or region where the work is to be performed 
the bid estimate forms the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project control system  enabling management to monitor projects effectively 
all us government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the client 
in addition  some contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements that require us to pay liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances within our control 
we act as the primary contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as the primary contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  horizontal directional drills  non destructive inspection  catering and security 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as the primary contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 

table of contents under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease possibly resulting in a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and may incur losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in some cases  we are able to recover additional costs and profits from the client through the change order process 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs  and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
our accounting policy related to contract variations and claims requires recognition of all costs as incurred 
revenue from change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work is recognized when an agreement is reached with the client as to the scope of work and when it is probable that the cost of such work will be recovered in a change in contract price 
profit on change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
also included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on uncompleted contracts are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs unapproved change orders 
these amounts are recorded at their estimated net realizable value when realization is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated recoverable amounts of recorded unapproved change orders may be made in the near term 
if we do not successfully resolve these matters  a net expense recorded as a reduction in revenues  may be required  in addition to amounts that have been previously provided 
employees at december   we directly employed a multi national work force of  persons  of which approximately percent were citizens of the respective countries in which they work 
although the level of activity varies from year to year  we have maintained an average work force of approximately  over the past five years 
the minimum employment during that period has been  and the maximum was  at december   approximately percent of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe relations with our employees are satisfactory 
the following table sets forth the location of employees by work countries as of december  number of employees percent us upstream oil gas us downstream oil gas us administration canada oman other international libya total equipment we own  lease and maintain a fleet of generally standardized construction  transportation and support equipment 
in and  expenditures for capital equipment were approximately  and  respectively 
at december   the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was approximately  we constantly evaluate the availability of equipment and in recent years have leased equipment to ensure its availability to support projects 
during  we acquired approximately  of new equipment through various capital lease facilities 
by contrast  during  we paid approximately  to convert existing capital leases to company owned equipment and did not enter into any new capital leases 
we continue to evaluate expected equipment utilization  given anticipated market conditions  and may buy or lease new equipment and dispose of underutilized equipment from time to time 
all equipment is subject to scheduled maintenance to maximize fleet readiness

rent expense for all leased facilities was approximately  in and  in insurance and bonding operational risks are analyzed and categorized by our risk management department and are insured through major international insurance brokers under a comprehensive insurance program  which includes commercial insurance policies  consisting of the types and amounts typically carried by companies engaged in the worldwide engineering and construction industry 
we maintain worldwide master policies written mostly through highly rated insurers 
these policies cover our property  plant  equipment and cargo against all normally insurable risks  including war risk  political risk and terrorism in third world countries 
other policies cover our workers and liabilities arising out of our operations 
primary and excess liability insurance limits are consistent with the level of our asset base 
risks of loss or damage to project works and materials are often insured on our behalf by our clients 
on other projects  builders all risk insurance is purchased when deemed necessary 
substantially all insurance is purchased and maintained at the corporate level  other than certain basic insurance  which must be purchased in some countries in order to comply with local insurance laws 

table of contents the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the future  our ability to maintain insurance  which may not be available or at rates we consider reasonable  may be affected by events over which we have no control  such as those that occurred on september  in we were not constrained by our ability to bond new projects  nor have we been negatively impacted in early global warming and climate change recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
as a result  there have been a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
in  the united states supreme court held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
in december  the epa responded to that holding and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of sometimes referred to as the waxman markey global climate change bill 
the bill includes many provisions that could potentially have a significant impact on us as well as our customers 
the bill proposes a cap and trade regime  a renewable portfolio standard  electric efficiency standards  revised transmission policy and mandated investments in plug in hybrid infrastructure and smart grid technology 
the net effect of the bill will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil  refined petroleum products and natural gas 
although proposals have been introduced in the us senate  including a proposal that would require greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions than the american clean energy and security act of  it is uncertain at this time whether  and in what form  legislation will be adopted by the us senate 
both president obama and the administrator of the epa have repeatedly indicated their preference for comprehensive legislation to address this issue and create the framework for a clean energy economy 
in september  the epa finalized a rule requiring nation wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions beginning january  the rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year  and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas  as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines 
we do not know and cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments 
depending on the final provisions of such rules or legislation  it is possible that such future laws and regulations could result in increasing our compliance costs or additional operating restrictions as well as those of our customers 
it is also possible that such future developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels  which could adversely affect the demand for some of our services  which in turn could adversely affect our future results of operations 
likewise  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any changes to temperature  storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change or otherwise will have a material impact on our operations 
compliance with applicable environmental requirements has not  to date  had a material effect on the cost of our operations  earnings or competitive position 
however  as noted above in connection with our discussion of the regulation of greenhouse gases  compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements of existing environmental regulations or requirements may cause us to incur additional costs or subject us to liabilities that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks 
risks related to our business our business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil  gas and power companies on infrastructure 
our revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major engineering and construction projects 
the availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil  gas and power industries  specifically  the level of capital expenditures of oil  gas and power companies on infrastructure 
the credit crisis in  which continues to some extent  and related distress in the global financial system  including capital markets  as well as the global recession  continue to have an adverse impact on the level of capital expenditures of oil  gas and power companies and or their ability to finance these expenditures 
our failure to obtain major projects  the delay in awards of major projects  the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under utilization of our resources  which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow 
there are numerous factors beyond our control that influence the level of capital expenditures of oil  gas and power companies  including current and projected oil  gas and electric power prices  as well as refining margins  the demand for gasoline and electricity  the abilities of oil  gas and electric power companies to generate  access and deploy capital  exploration  production and transportation costs  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions  regulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers  local and international political and economic conditions  the ability or willingness of host country government entities to fund their budgetary commitments  and technological advances 
our final settlements with the doj and the sec  and the prosecution of former employees  may negatively impact our ongoing operations 
as a result of our final settlements with the doj and the sec resolving their investigations of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act and other provisions of the federal securities laws  which are more fully described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k  we are subject to ongoing review and regulation of our business operations  including the review of our operations and compliance program by a government approved independent monitor 
the activities of the independent monitor have had  and will continue to have  a cost to us and may cause a change in our processes and operations  the outcome of which we are unable to predict 
in addition  the settlements  and the prosecution of former employees  may impact our operations or result in legal actions against us in countries that are the subject of the settlements 
the final settlements could also result in third party claims against us  which may include claims for special  indirect  derivative or consequential damages 

table of contents our failure to comply with the terms of settlement agreements with the doj and sec would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 
under our final settlements with the doj and sec  we are subject to a three year deferred prosecution agreement dpa and permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws  respectively 
as provided for in the dpa  with the approval of the doj and effective september   we retained a government approved independent monitor  at our expense  for a two and one half year period  who is reporting to the doj on our compliance with the dpa 
since the appointment of the monitor  we have cooperated and provided the monitor with access to information  documents  records  facilities and employees 
on march   the monitor filed with the doj the first of three required reports under the dpa 
in the report  the monitor made numerous findings and recommendations to us with respect to the improvement of our internal controls  policies and procedures for detecting and preventing violations of applicable anti corruption laws 
findings and recommendations have been made concerning the improvement of policies and processes related to the vetting of employees  disclosure and tracking of conflicts of interest  our fcpa training program  the fcpa certification process  procurement and project controls  as well as to improve our ability to detect and prevent violations of applicable anti corruption laws 
the report also sets out for the doj s review any findings relating to specific matters that came to the monitor s attention during the course of his review 
the report has highlighted the need for improved internal controls concerning the vetting of new hires  the disclosure of conflicts of interest and effective communication of such conflicts of interest within the company 
we are now in the process of improving our hiring procedure and conflict of interest policies and have openly discussed these matters with the doj  as we are obligated to do pursuant to the terms of the dpa 
our failure to comply with the terms of the settlements with the doj and sec could result in resumed prosecution and other regulatory sanctions  and could otherwise negatively affect our operations 
in addition  if we fail to make timely payment of the penalty amounts due to the doj and or the disgorgement amounts specified in the sec settlement  the doj and or the sec will have the right to accelerate payment  and demand that the entire balance be paid immediately 
our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program  including our supervision  training and retention of competent employees  the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our foreign corrupt practices act compliance manual and code of business conduct and ethics  our continuing management of our agents and business partners  and our successful implementation of the recommendations of the independent monitor to further improve our compliance program and internal controls 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further discussion of this subject 
we may continue to experience losses associated with our prior nigeria based operations which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in february  we completed the sale of our nigerian operations 
in august  we and our subsidiary  willbros international services nigeria limited  entered into a global settlement agreement with ascot offshore nigeria limited ascot  the purchaser of our nigerian operations and berkeley group plc  the purchaser s parent company the global settlement agreement 
among other matters  the global settlement agreement provided for the payment by us of an amount in full and final settlement of all disputes between ascot and us related to the working capital adjustment to the closing purchase price under the february share purchase agreement 
in connection with the sale of our nigerian operations  we also entered into a transition services agreement the transition services agreement  and ascot delivered a promissory note in our favor 
the global settlement agreement provided for a settlement in the amount of million  the amount by which we and ascot agreed to adjust the closing purchase price downward the settlement amount 
under the global settlement agreement  we retained approximately million of the settlement amount and credited this amount to the account of ascot for amounts which were due to us under the transition services agreement and promissory note 
our payment of the balance of the settlement amount settled i any and all obligations and disputes between ascot and us in relation to the adjustment to the closing purchase price under the share purchase agreement and ii all of the parties respective rights and obligations under the indemnification provisions of the share purchase agreement  except as provided in the global settlement agreement 
as partial consideration for the parties agreement on the settlement amount  ascot secured with a non nigerian bank supplemental backstop letters of credit totaling approximately million  which backstopped corresponding letter of credit obligations that we had under various contracts taken over by ascot 
all of our letters of credit related to our former operations in nigeria have expired 
on february   the transition services agreement with ascot expired according to its terms 
we may  however  continue to experience substantial losses or incur significant expenses subsequent to the sale and disposition of our operations and the global settlement agreement 
in particular the same difficulties which led to our leaving nigeria continue to exist for ascot  as well as additional challenges  including various financial difficulties that we understand ascot may from time to time be experiencing 
accordingly  ascot s continued willingness and ability to perform our former projects in west africa continue to be important factors to further reducing our risk profile in nigeria and elsewhere in west africa 
we issued parent company guarantees to our former clients in connection with the performance of some of our contracts in nigeria and nearby west africa locations 
although ascot assumed the responsibility for completing these projects  our parent company guarantees may remain in force in varying degrees until the projects are completed 
indemnities are in place pursuant to which ascot and its parent company are obligated to indemnify us for any losses we incur under these parent company guarantees 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our indemnity rights 
the guarantees include five projects under which we estimated that  at february   there was aggregate remaining contract revenue of approximately million and aggregate cost to complete of approximately million 

table of contents in early  we received our first notification asserting various rights under one of our outstanding parent guarantees 
on february   willbros west africa  inc wwai  the ascot company performing the west african gas pipeline wagp contract  received a letter from west african gas pipeline company limited wapco  the owner of wagp  wherein wapco gave written notice alleging that wwai was in default under the wagp contract  as amended  and giving wwai a brief cure period to remedy the alleged default 
we understand that wwai responded by denying being in breach of its wagp contract obligations  and apparently also advised wapco that wwai requires a further million  without which it will not be able to complete the work which it had previously undertaken to perform 
we understand that  on february   wapco terminated the wagp contract for the alleged continuing non performance of wwai 
in february  we received a letter from wapco reminding us of our parent guarantee on the wagp contract and requesting that we remedy wwai s default under that contract  as amended 
in february  we received another letter from wapco formally demanding that we pay all sums payable in consequence of the non performance by ascot with wapco and stating that quantification of that amount would be provided sometime in the future when the work was completed 
on previous occasions  we have advised wapco that  for a variety of legal  contractual  and other reasons  we did not consider our prior wagp contract parent guarantee to have continued application  and we have reiterated that position to wapco 
wapco disputes our position that we are no longer bound by the terms of our prior parent guarantee of the wagp contract and has reserved all its rights in that regard 
on february   we received a letter from attorneys representing wapco seeking to recover from us under our prior wagp contract parent company guarantee for losses and damages allegedly incurred by wapco in connection with the alleged non performance of wwai under the wagp contract 
while a proceeding has not been filed in any court  the letter purports to be a formal notice of a claim for purposes of the pre action protocol for construction and engineering disputes under the rules of the high court in london  england 
the letter claims damages in the amount of approximately million  even though the total contract amount  at the time we sold our nigeria operations  was only million 
we anticipate that this dispute with wapco may result in litigation between wapco and us under english law in the london high court to determine the enforceability  in whole or in part  of our parent company guarantee  which we expect to be a lengthy process 
we intend to contest this matter vigorously  but we cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome 
we currently have no employees working in nigeria and we have no intention of returning to nigeria 
if ultimately it is determined by an english court that we are liable  in whole or in part  for damages that wapco may establish against wwai for wwai s alleged non performance of the wagp contract  or if wapco is able to establish liability against us directly under our parent company guarantee  and  in either case  we are unable to enforce our rights under the indemnity agreement entered into with ascot in connection with the wagp contract  we may experience substantial losses 
however  management cannot  at this time  predict the outcome of any proceeding which may ensue in this developing wagp contract dispute  or be certain of the degree to which the indemnity agreement given in our favor by ascot will protect us 
we have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
as a result  our business  operating results and liquidity could be harmed 
as disclosed in our annual reports on form k for   and  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting identified several material weaknesses 
these material weaknesses led to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and and the first three quarters of we believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated 
our management has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  and however  our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis  which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity 
furthermore  because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud  even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements 

table of contents our international operations are subject to political and economic risks of developing countries 
we have operations in the middle east oman and libya and anticipate that a portion of our contract revenue will be derived from  and a portion of our long lived assets will be located in  developing countries 
conducting operations in developing countries presents significant commercial challenges for our business 
a disruption of activities  or loss of use of equipment or installations  at any location in which we have significant assets or operations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we are subject to risks that ordinarily would not be expected to exist to the same extent in the united states  canada  australia or western europe 
some of these risks include civil uprisings  terrorism  riots and war  which can make it impractical to continue operations  adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses  repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements and converting it into dollars or other fungible currency  exchange rate fluctuations  which can reduce the purchasing power of local currencies and cause our costs to exceed our budget  reducing our operating margin in the affected country  expropriation of assets  by either a recognized or unrecognized foreign government  which can disrupt our business activities and create delays and corresponding losses  availability of suitable personnel and equipment  which can be affected by government policy  or changes in policy  which limit the importation of skilled craftsmen or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient  governmental instability  which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential customers to be withdrawn or delayed  reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services  decrees  laws  regulations  interpretations and court decisions under legal systems  which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs  and restrictive governmental registration and licensing requirements  which can limit the pursuit of certain business activities 
our operations in developing countries may be adversely affected in the event any governmental agencies in these countries interpret laws  regulations or court decisions in a manner which might be considered inconsistent or inequitable in the united states  canada  japan or western europe 
we may be subject to unanticipated taxes  including income taxes  excise duties  import taxes  export taxes  sales taxes or other governmental assessments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any quarter or year 
these risks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by a concentration of business in a particular country 
due to a limited number of major projects worldwide  we expect to have a substantial portion of our resources dedicated to projects located in a few countries 
therefore  our results of operations are susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in a particular country in which our business may be concentrated at that time 
economic downturns in such countries could also have an adverse impact on our operations 
special risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business 
our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent 
since the anti bribery restrictions of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage  we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 

table of contents our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations  terminations  or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn 
many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them  in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits 
therefore  project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits 
our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us 
we occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional costs  both direct and indirect 
these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
our failure to resolve matters related to a facility construction project termination could have a material adverse impact on us 
on january   transcanada pipelines  ltd 
tcpl notified us that we were in breach of contract and were being terminated for cause immediately on a facility construction contract for seven pump stations in nebraska and kansas that was awarded to us in september at the time of termination  we had completed approximately percent of our scope of work 
although we have disputed the validity of the termination for cause as well as the contractual procedure followed by tcpl for termination  we have agreed in good faith to cooperate with tcpl in an orderly demobilization and handover of the remaining work 
we are working with tcpl to resolve and collect payment on all billed and unbilled amounts owed to us  which  as of december   was approximately million 
since then  additional reimbursable costs  including demobilization costs  have been incurred 
as of december   the company is unable to estimate a reserve and as such no reserve has been established 
if this termination for cause is ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable  we could be held liable for any damages resulting from our alleged breach of contract  including but not limited to  incremental costs incurred by tcpl to hire a replacement contractor to complete the remainder of the work as compared to the costs we would have incurred to perform the same scope of work 
we would also not be entitled to reimbursement of our demobilization costs 
although we do not believe that we were in breach of contract and will vigorously defend our contract rights  the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
for a further discussion of this matter  see note contingencies  commitments and other circumstances to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our business is dependent on a limited number of key clients 
we operate primarily in the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and electric power industries  providing services to a limited number of clients 
much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients 
the loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
one client is responsible for percent of our backlog at december  
table of contents our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our projects is currently performed on a fixed price basis 
under a fixed price contract  we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project  based upon a defined scope  which includes specific assumptions and project criteria 
if our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur  our margins will decrease  and we may incur a loss 
the revenue  cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract 
if we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks  we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending on the size of a project  these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year 
in general  turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations 
this is a result of the long term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts  whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract 
percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our operating results 
we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method on long term fixed price contracts 
under this method  estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined 
accordingly  contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved  and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised 
these estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience  and are only estimates 
variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material 
to the extent that these adjustments result in an increase  a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue  we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
terrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations  our ability to raise capital or secure insurance  or our future growth 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating both outside and inside the united states 
further  the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments may subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to a number of operational risks 
our business operations include pipeline construction  fabrication  pipeline rehabilitation services and construction and turnaround and maintenance services to refiners and petrochemical facilities 
these operations involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  equipment and the environment  and suspension of operations 
in locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others  our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage  loss of revenue  casualty loss  increased costs and significant liability to third parties 

table of contents the insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject 
an enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
our goodwill may become impaired 
we have a substantial amount of goodwill following our acquisitions of inserv  midwest and wink 
at least annually  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of each operating unit 
this estimated fair value could change if there were future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  capital expenditure levels or ability to perform at levels that were forecasted 
these changes could result in an impairment that would require a material non cash charge to our results of operations 
a significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill 
we will continue to monitor the carrying value of our goodwill 
although we did not record an impairment with respect to our downstream oil gas segment at december   for purposes of that evaluation  our estimated fair value of that segment only exceeded its carrying value by percent 
for further discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of long lived assets included in this form k 
we may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors 
some of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties 
in addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work  where work is performed through a joint venture  we also have potential liability for the work performed by our joint ventures 
in these projects  even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget  we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of our joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications 
we act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake 
in our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor  we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as hazardous waste removal  nondestructive inspection and catering and security 
however  with respect to epc and other contracts  we may choose to subcontract a substantial portion of the project 
in the construction industry  the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  when acting as a prime contractor  we are subject to the risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
governmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate  including those relating to currency conversion and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and earnings of our personnel  the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers  including  in some jurisdictions  mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets 
in addition  we depend on the demand for our services from the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and power industries  and  therefore  our business is affected by changing taxes  price controls and laws and regulations relating to these industries generally 
the adoption of laws and regulations by the countries or the states in which we operate that are intended to curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas or the development of electric power generation facilities for economic and other policy reasons  could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services 
our operations are also subject to the risk of changes in laws and policies which may impose restrictions on our business  including trade restrictions  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
other types of governmental regulation which could  if enacted or implemented  adversely affect our operations include expropriation or nationalization decrees  confiscatory tax systems  primary or secondary boycotts directed at specific countries or companies  
table of contents embargoes  extensive import restrictions or other trade barriers  mandatory sourcing and local participation rules  stringent local registration or ownership requirements  oil  gas or electric power price regulation  unrealistically high labor rate and fuel price regulation  and registration and licensing requirements 
our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in  or new interpretations of  existing regulations  and the impact of these changes could be material 
our strategic plan relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth 
acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 
our strategic plan involves growth through  among other things  the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including inherent difficulties relating to combining previously separate businesses  diversion of management s attention from ongoing day to day operations  the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business  including both foreseen and unforeseen liabilities  failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations  difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel  services and systems of an acquired business and to integrating marketing  contracting  commercial and other operational disciplines  difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business  and failure to retain key or essential employees or customers of  or any government contracts held by  an acquired business 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
our operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities 
our us and canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent 
we regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas  such as rivers  lakes and wetlands 
significant fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances  rendering a person liable for environmental damage  without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
in addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed 
we own and operate several properties in the united states and canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released 
any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  the resource compensation and recovery act rcra  and analogous state  provincial or local laws 
cercla imposes joint and several liabilities  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment  while rcra governs the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property 
this could have a significant impact on our future results 

table of contents our operations outside of the united states and canada are oftentimes potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment 
we are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
as a result  there have been a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states as well as other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
although we are unable to predict how such legislation or regulations would impact our business and operations  it is possible that such future laws and regulations could result in increasing our compliance costs or additional operating restrictions as well as our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services 
for a further discussion  see items and business and properties global warming and climate change 
our industry is highly competitive  which could impede our growth 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
a substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals 
we compete for these projects against government owned or supported companies and other companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
in some markets  there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price 
our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies 
the global recession has intensified competition in the industries in which we operate as our competitors in these industries pursue reduced work volumes 
our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures  greater resources or other advantages and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept 
our operating results could be adversely affected if our non us operations became taxable in the united states 
if any income earned before the company s change of domicile in march by willbros group  inc or its non us subsidiaries from operations outside the united states constituted income effectively connected with a us trade or business  and as a result became taxable in the united states  our consolidated operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the services of our executive management 
our success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management 
our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships 
our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients  stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management team 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover  which may adversely affect the performance of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  which allows only one third of our directors to be elected each year  deny stockholders the ability to take action by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders  provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors  chairman  chief executive officer or president  and authorize our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise  either by us  a member of management or a major stockholder  or the perception that these sales could occur  may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions  we may dilute share ownership 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
if we do issue additional equity securities  such issuances may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders individual ownership percentages in our company

the issuance of warrants and the prior issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes and million of our senior convertible notes due the notes may cause a significant increase in the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding 
in may  we induced the conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes into a total of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  certain holders have exercised their right to convert the notes  converting approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes into  shares of our common stock as of december  as of december    shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and  shares of common stock are issuable upon conversion of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes 
if we elect to induce the conversion of additional convertible notes or holders elect to convert additional convertible notes  there may be a significant increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
our authorized shares of common stock consist of million shares 
the issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders 
we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  one million shares of preferred stock  which may give other stockholders dividend  conversion  voting and liquidation rights  among other rights  which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share amounts or unless otherwise noted the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and  included in item of this form k 
overview summary financial results from continuing operations were revenue  net income  and earnings per diluted share 
while we reported another profitable year  the results are lower than we had originally expected for market conditions were more unfavorable than originally projected and contributed to persistent downward margin pressure 
the combination of lower earnings attributable to the economic recession  significant charges required to implement cost reduction initiatives and our decision to retain people and equipment to position the company for an expected upturn in  resulted in realized earnings below our original early expectations  especially in the last half of the year 
some of the factors contributing to lower than anticipated financial results were cost reduction initiatives started at year end to resize and realign the company for the changing market conditions were offset by a positive view of near term market opportunities resulting in the retention of certain resources 
in addition  to achieve these cost reductions the company incurred additional other charges totaling  comprised of severance  accelerated stock vesting and lease abandonment charges 
as part of our strategy to diversify geographically and expand our service offerings  we evaluated and pursued various acquisition opportunities  incurring charges of  for various reasons  we elected to cease our pursuit of several companies  however  we were successful in acquiring the engineering business of wink companies  llc wink in july to fulfill our downstream epc strategy objective 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred costs of  related to the deferred prosecution agreement dpa entered into in as part of the settlement of our foreign corrupt practices act fcpa violations 
these costs are associated with the department of justice monitor who was appointed on september  see note contingencies  commitments and other circumstances in item of this form k for additional information 
these three items taken together represent a pre tax charge of  and an after tax charge of  to net income loss per share 
most of our profit was recognized in the first half of  net income from continuing operations for the first six months was  and diluted earnings per share was 
these favorable results were achieved by working off our year end backlog  mainly large diameter pipeline projects in the united states and canada  and successfully completing a new large diameter pipeline project the texas independence pipeline project tips 
the award of the fayetteville express pipeline project fep contract in the third quarter coupled with over billion of us pipeline bids that we continue to actively pursue  solidified our decision to retain idle large diameter pipeline equipment and personnel resources 
this decision impacted the fourth quarter continuing operations financial results  contributing to a loss of  or loss per share of 
although was a more difficult year than expected for both us and our customers  we made significant progress in several areas during as part of our commitment to managing willbros based on our values  we have made a substantial commitment to place the best people in the right job 
we have approached this task from the top down 
over the past year  we have strengthened our overall senior management group by hiring rich cellon to lead the development of our government services business and kevin fleury to manage our canada business 
mr 
cellon  a retired us navy rear admiral  brings over years of us government leadership experience in facilities management  construction  and procurement  as well as contingency operations 
mr 
fleury has over years of western canadian oilfield services experience  including his most recent position as the ceo and president of a large canadian energy services company 
additionally  we have placed new business unit presidents in our upstream engineering and us construction businesses and created and staffed two new corporate executive positions senior vice president project management to further enhance the profitable execution of our projects  and chief compliance officer to ensure adherence with our policies and procedures and identify areas of risk requiring additional controls 
we believe that we are making steady progress in placing the best people in the right job 

table of contents we achieved several other noteworthy accomplishments in we successfully executed several major pipeline projects  redomiciled the company from panama to the united states  acquired wink  added backlog late in the year for execution  finalized and executed an alliance agreement with nisource  and invested in the continued development of our strategic initiatives relating to government services and international growth  all while many of our customers were reducing capital investment and tightening service budgets 
we have made significant progress despite a difficult market environment 
outlook in the third quarter of  we communicated an increased optimism for based on several internal factors positively affecting our visibility and outlook for the coming year 
these factors included adding significant backlog in both of our segments for the first time in five quarters  improving our visibility and assessment of the us pipeline construction activity expected for the period of through  recognizing the potential upside from our long term alliance arrangement with nisource  acknowledging a significant increase in bidding and proposal activity across all service offerings  and anticipating the positive impact from our efforts to reduce our costs while positioning the company for the future 
as we look at the market in and beyond  we see external factors which support this heightened optimism that we have weathered the storm and better times are ahead 
questions remain  however  as to the magnitude of the near term improvement in and the timing of new capital projects 
in our downstream oil gas segment  we continue to see restrained capital spending as a result of poor current refining petrochemical sector profitability and a consensus negative future near term outlook projected until domestic product demand increases and asset utilization improves 
however  on the positive side  our customers have budgeted funds to complete previously deferred maintenance activities 
our downstream oil gas segment has approximately  of backlog on december  relating to refinery turnaround services to be worked off in also  our downstream oil gas segment s new engineering business unit wink has provided us with an expanded customer base and is actively involved in bidding and proposing small capital projects that provide quick cash paybacks 
turnaround services are expected to drive improved downstream oil gas segment operating results in  and small capital projects  when they materialize  should provide some opportunity for margin expansion 
in  our upstream oil gas segment is projected to have similar results to last year  characterized by significant sequential quarter variances caused by the unevenness of large diameter pipeline construction activity 
these quarterly variances are likely to be further amplified by our customers returning to historic norms of reducing activity levels during the higher weather risk winter months 
as previously discussed  we expect to incur a loss in the first quarter of largely as a result of underutilized pipeline construction and field service people and equipment resources in the us and canada 
the following three quarters are expected to be improved over the anticipated first quarter results 
several factors are expected to contribute to this return to profitability  including the start up of the fep project in the us early in the second quarter  the anticipated increase in oil sands field service activity and improved performance of our upstream engineering business unit 
our level of profitability in and beyond will be dependent on several external factors outside of our control 
some of the key external factors that will determine the level of activity in the energy infrastructure sector are as follows projected gdp growth 
percent in and percent in in the us versus a percent decline in  while globally  gdp is projected to grow by percent in and percent in global economic growth  as measured by gdp  is a key driver of energy demand and the associated infrastructure needed to develop  process  and transport energy 
the pace and tenor of gdp growth is likely to be a key factor in new infrastructure investment decisions 
improved commodity prices 
crude oil averaged per barrel in based on west texas intermediate wti pricing and is expected to increase to nearly per barrel through natural gas prices remain depressed relative to oil prices due to an excess of supply versus demand 
natural gas averaged per mmbtu in based on henry hub prices and is expected to increase to per mmbtu in and per mmbtu in source energy information administration short term energy outlook dated january  

table of contents timing of investments 
significant energy infrastructure investment will be required to develop new natural gas industrial and electricity demand sources new power plant build out  natural gas as transportation fuel or other potential demand drivers utilizing natural gas production from the unconventional gas shale plays 
also  the yet to be determined outcome of decisions on the investment level for domestic electricity sources other than natural gas nuclear  clean coal and renewables  could pull demand away from natural gas 
legislative uncertainty in the united states 
cap and trade  health care  environmental regulations  capital availability and potential tax increases are impacting our customers capital expenditure decisions  particularly with regard to the timing of new investments 
energy policy  in general  will clearly impact the timing and extent of energy infrastructure investment 
while natural gas appears to be well positioned to benefit from trends toward clean  efficient and domestically produced fuels  government support for alternative energy sources  be it wind  solar or nuclear  may impact demand for natural gas 
excess domestic refinery capacity 
current refinery utilization is less than percent and a moderate improvement to percent is expected in the time period 
excess capacity exists that is slowly being reviewed and eliminated  primarily the older  cost inefficient refineries 
these external factors will likely create uncertainty in the timing of heightened infrastructure investment  the timing of margin improvements resulting from better pricing and the level of asset utilization during many of our customers share the view that the domestic energy market is improving  but remain cautious in predicting the timing and level of the expected market improvement to be realized in in the near term  the upstream sector is expected to benefit from positive factors such as increases in rig count in north america as well as projected increases in oil demand in developing global markets  offset by uncertain natural gas activity responding to oversupplied worldwide markets 
in the downstream sector  the views are considerably less favorable as sharp declines in crack spreads and regulatory uncertainty negatively impact the refining industry in the near to long term 
however  in the long term  confidence remains that increased spending will be necessary to meet global demand 
although  uncertainty remains in the market place  we believe it is at a lower level than one year ago 
during the past year  we have focused on creating a more flexible business model for willbros that is scalable in both an expanding and contracting market 
we accomplished this by remaining focused on the low risk north american market  expanding the breadth of our service offering  and creating financial flexibility by building a cash reserve and retaining our borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility 
our financial flexibility remains intact with a year end cash balance of  short term investments of  and unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility of  in addition  we have focused on improving our processes and procedures relative to project management  project controls and information flow to enable the company to execute better on an expected increased volume of fixed price  competitively bid projects 
it is the uncertainty around the short term external factors that makes difficult to predict and precisely why over the past couple years  we focused on implementing a more flexible business model 
this model has allowed us the flexibility to consider investment in growth opportunities and to retain resources while aggressively expanding our business development function  rather than waiting until after the markets improve 
it also allows us to scale the business down should market events warrant this action 
in the long term  we are confident significant investment will be made over many years in energy infrastructure and we believe willbros is properly positioned to take advantage of this build out and our strategy will provide significant upside opportunities 
our strategy as expanded upon in detail in items and business and properties of this form k  our vision is to be a leading provider to the global infrastructure and government services markets of diversified professional construction and maintenance solutions addressing the entire asset lifecycle 
adherence to our values of safety  honesty and integrity  our people  our customers  superior financial performance  vision and innovation and effective communication will guide us in the execution of our strategy which consists of the following focusing on managing risk  leveraging our industry position and reputation into a broader service offering  
table of contents maintaining financial flexibility  and leveraging our core service expertise into additional full epc contracts 
successfully executing our strategy will ensure that we not only are well positioned to address the challenges of  but also are positioned for success and to drive shareholder value for years to come

overall reductions for the year totaled  offset by  of cost associated with the doj monitor appointed in late september  and cost incurred to evaluate several acquisition opportunities of  interest  net expense decreased percent to  from  in the decrease in net expense is the result of a decrease in interest expense of  primarily due to decreased capital lease obligations as a result of buy outs during the second quarter of  offset by  of decreased interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents as a result of declining interest rates throughout other  net income decreased  percent to from  in this change was primarily driven by a  gain recognized as a result of selling one of our fabrication facilities in canada during there were no significant gains recognized during the provision for income taxes for decreased  percent to  on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the decrease in the provision for income taxes is due to the decrease in operating income recognized during and a decrease in effective tax rate primarily due to the reversal of uncertain tax positions 
fourth quarter results in the fourth quarter of  a net loss of  resulted from continuing operations on revenue of  as compared to net income of  from continuing operations on revenue of  for the third quarter of 
table of contents the fourth quarter of s sequential quarter decrease of  percent in revenue is primarily due to a lack of pipeline construction activity as pipeline construction work returns to a more seasonal pattern of execution concentrated from early spring to late fall drier months 
the corresponding sequential quarter decrease in operating income was  percent 
the fourth quarter of had an operating loss of  versus operating income of  in the third quarter of the operating margins for the fourth quarter and third quarter of were negative percent and percent  respectively 
the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted by increased sequential quarter g a costs of  that were largely due to an increase in doj monitor costs of  and acquisition related costs of in the fourth quarter and the favorable impact in the third quarter of reversing of the annual bonus accrual as a result of our failure to meet bonus metrics 
also unfavorably impacting fourth quarter results were other charges consisting of severance and lease abandonment costs in relation to our right sizing efforts of  an increase of  as compared to the third quarter of financial position working capital at december   excluding discontinued operations  increased  percent to  from  in this increase is primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  due to a decrease in activity at year end  an increase in short term investments of  offset by a decrease in cash of  a reduction in accounts receivable of  and in contract cost and recognized income not yet billed of  as a result of reduced activity at year end  and an increase in notes payable and current portion of other long term debt of  as a result of reclassifying some of our convertible notes to current 
our debt to equity ratio at december   decreased to from at december  our aggregate outstanding debt decreased  to  at december  from  at december   related to the buy out of capital leases of  and the reduction of short term debt due to the prepayment of insurance rather than financing as done in stockholders equity increased  to  at december  from  at december  other financial measures backlog in our industry  backlog is considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
our strategy is focused on capturing quality backlog with margins commensurate with the risks associated with a given project  and for the past several years we have put processes and procedures in place to identify contractual and execution risks in new work opportunities and believe we have instilled in the organization the discipline to price  accept and book only work which meets stringent criteria for commercial success and profitability 
we believe the backlog figures are firm  subject only to the cancellation and modification provisions contained in various contracts 
additionally  due to the short duration of many jobs  revenue associated with jobs performed within a reporting period will not be reflected in quarterly backlog reports 
we generate revenue from numerous sources  including contracts of long or short duration entered into during a year as well as from various contractual processes  including change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work 
these revenue sources are not added to backlog until realization is assured 
backlog consists of anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts and contracts whose award is reasonably assured 
at december   total backlog from continuing operations decreased  percent to  from  at december  this reduction in backlog was driven by the completion of projects contained in our backlog at december  including the midcontinent express pipeline project in the us and the alberta clipper project in canada  both large diameter pipeline projects  as well as maintenance work performed in canada s oil sands 
these reductions were partially offset by the addition of the fayetteville express pipeline project into backlog in the third quarter 
table of contents in our upstream oil gas segment  our pipeline construction services contracting has experienced a return to a historical north america contracting model that is characterized by competitive fixed price bids and short time periods from project bid to execution  except for large epc contracts that can span more than one year 
with the return to historical contracting methods  we expect to experience lower backlog numbers partially as a result of eliminating the much longer lead times between award and executing a project 
in our downstream oil gas segment  economic conditions in resulted in the delay or cancellation of various maintenance and capital projects  however  we believe the delays of maintenance and project work have reached a limit related to the safety and operational concerns of our customers resulting in the awarding of critical maintenance projects 
as a result  backlog for downstream oil gas has increased in the second half of as compared to the levels in the first half of the year 
cost reimbursable contracts comprised percent of backlog at december  versus percent of backlog at december  we expect that approximately  or about percent  of our existing total backlog at december   will be recognized in revenue during there was no backlog for discontinued operations at december  and december  the following table shows our backlog by operating segment as of december  and year ended december  amount percent amount percent upstream oil gas downstream oil gas total backlog ebitda from continuing operations we believe that ebitda earnings before net interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment of intangible assets is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance 
ebitda from continuing operations for decreased  to  from  in the decrease in ebitda during is primarily a result of a decrease in contract income of  excluding depreciation and an increase in other charges of  partially offset by a decrease in g a of  excluding depreciation 
the decrease in contract income excluding depreciation results primarily from the  percent decrease in revenue and from a decrease in contract margin of percent 
the increase in other charges relates primarily to our severance and lease abandonment initiative  which also contributed to the decrease in g a

discontinued operations for the year ended december   loss from discontinued operations was  or per share 
this compares to income from discontinued operations of  or per share for the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations is primarily due to the  write off of a note receivable associated with the sale of assets and operations in venezuela  offset by net income of for nigeria discontinued operations 
at the time of the february  sale of our nigeria assets and operations  we had four letters of credit outstanding totaling  associated with discontinued operations 
in the first quarter of  all remaining letters of credit related to our former operations in nigeria expired  leaving no outstanding amounts at december  transition services agreement tsa the tsa expired on february   which ended our obligation to provide any further support or other services to ascot in west africa or otherwise 

table of contents parent company guarantees although the nigeria letters of credit and the tsa have expired  we continue to have potential financial exposure from parent company performance guarantees related to several projects in nigeria that were contracted by our subsidiary  willbros west africa  inc wwai  at the time of our february  sale of wwai to ascot 
on february   we received a letter from attorneys representing west african gas pipeline company limited wapco advising us that we were liable for approximately  of damages allegedly incurred by wapco to complete the remaining portion of the scope of work a portion of the west africa gas pipeline project or wagp originally contracted by wwai 
after wwai was sold to ascot  on february   wapco provided wwai with notice of termination of the wagp contract 
we intend to contest this claim for damages vigorously 
at this time  no estimate can be made on the likely outcome of what is expected to be a prolonged period of litigation

results of operations our contract revenue and contract costs are significantly impacted by the capital budgets of our clients and the timing and location of development projects in the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical and power industries worldwide 
contract revenue and cost vary by country from year to year as the result of entering and exiting work countries  the execution of new contract awards  the completion of contracts  and the overall level of demand for our services 
our ability to be successful in obtaining and executing contracts can be affected by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar compared to the currencies of our competitors  our clients and our work locations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  contract revenue contract revenue decreased  percent to  from  primarily due to decreased upstream oil gas revenue  although downstream oil gas did incur a significant percentage decrease in revenue 
a year to year comparison of revenue is as follows year ended december  percent decrease change upstream oil gas downstream oil gas total upstream oil gas revenue decreased  percent to  from  in we believe the decrease in revenue was the result of our customers reduction in capital and maintenance spending in as a reaction to the overall global economic recession 
at each of our upstream oil gas business units  we experienced revenue decreases from percent to nearly percent 
the majority of our revenue percent was earned in the first six months of as we worked off existing backlog from our us construction business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in this was primarily due to reduced utilization of large diameter cross country pipeline construction assets of  and a reduction of pipeline construction epc work of  we believe both of these reductions were directly linked to the reduced capital budgets of our primary client base for this business 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue from our facility construction group of  and increased revenue from our manage maintain group of  the facility construction revenue was primarily attributable to one large project that included the construction of seven pump stations 
our canada business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease was primarily due to reduced capital budgets of the oil sand producers and pipeline companies  driven by the decline in crude oil prices year over year and the production costs associated with the oil sands 
revenue from our pipeline construction group decreased  additionally  our long term contracts for recurring maintenance at the oil sand production facilities generated  less in revenue in 
table of contents our us engineering business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in revenue from core engineering services declined  reflecting the significant drop off in market demand for front end design work for gas and liquid transportation systems 
the epc component of our offering  which declined  was affected by reduced capital expenditure budgets combined with owners increasing their risk tolerance associated with managing multiple aspects of these large projects 
our oman business unit revenue decreased  percent to  from  in this decrease was largely due to reduced work order activity of  from our primary client  to whom we provide both capital construction and maintenance services 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase of  in our rig moving services 
downstream oil gas revenue decreased  percent to  from  in  primarily as the result of declining construction revenue from capital projects 
the decline in refining profit margins slowed the release of capital projects by our customers 
as a result  while we continued to complete capital contracts awarded in and early  we were not able to replace them to the same extent as in the prior year 
construction services revenue decreased  percent to  primarily due to the completion of a major epc project early in  which was a significant source of construction services revenue in tank construction revenue decreased  percent to  the slow release of capital projects has increased competition and impacted the volume of contract awards that we have been able to obtain in both of these business units in the decline in profit margins in in the refining industry also resulted in the delay of several maintenance and turnaround projects from into this caused maintenance and turnaround revenue to decrease  percent to  downstream engineering revenue increased  percent to  primarily the result of our acquisition of wink in july operating income operating income decreased  percent to  from  in a year to year comparison of operating income is as follows year ended december  operating operating percent margin margin change change upstream oil gas downstream oil gas total upstream oil gas operating income decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease was caused by reduced revenue across the segment  as noted above  combined with increased margin pressure for most of our service offerings 
with fewer prospects available in  the competition for each project grew  forcing us to reduce margin expectations across the segment 
our contract margins for were lower than at three of our four primary business units  suffering declines from percentage points to percentage points 
the only business unit that improved contract income  year over year  was our us construction group  which improved percentage points 
in  we focused on reducing our overhead expenses to remain competitive in a market with fewer opportunities 
these efforts resulted in a reduction of our total g a costs of  in as a percent of segment revenue  g a costs represented percent  although this was an increase as compared to the equivalent percent in g a costs reductions lagged behind the percent revenue decline in operating income for our us construction business unit decreased  percent to  from  in while operating income was down  operating margin was steady year over year  increasing percentage point to percent from percent in in the face of increased competition and an overall weaker economy  this performance helped support the upstream oil gas segment 
while this business unit was able to improve contract margin year over year  this improvement did not offset the impact to operating income associated with the revenue decline of percent 
contract margin improvement was largely driven by two key factors  the completion of the midcontinent express pipeline project  a large multi spread cost reimbursable pipeline project  and the successful transition to and completion of tips  a lump sum two spread pipeline construction project 

table of contents tips performance exceeded expectations and contributed to the slight year over year margin improvement 
by comparison  our contract margin was largely attributable to two large multi spread pipeline construction projects with cost reimbursable terms  southeast supply header sesh and mep 
the cost reimbursable nature of these jobs ensured our profitability  but negatively impacted margin as the size of the projects increased revenue while our profit opportunity remained fixed 
these projects were also offset by smaller lump sum pipeline construction projects that did not perform to the as bid expectations 
we reduced our us construction g a costs by  in operating income for our canada business unit decreased  percent to  from  in this decrease was primarily caused by the reduction of revenue associated with our pipeline construction group in canada 
pipeline construction revenue decreased percent year over year 
in  our two largest pipeline construction projects generated  of revenue  compared to our two largest projects in which generated  this significant decrease was representative of the overall reduction of oil sands related pipeline construction projects in canada 
our maintenance and fabrication services were relatively constant year over year  providing some insulation from the cyclical pipeline construction market 
we reduced our canada g a costs by  in operating income for our us engineering business unit decreased  percent to a loss of  from income of  in a continuing reduction of our work load resulted in reduced utilization of resources throughout the year  and in response we initiated several reductions of force to match the resource base to the available work 
we began the year with approximately engineering and support staff  and we ended the year with approximately in addition to these reductions  we continued to evaluate and make corresponding reductions in other support 
in  we reduced our us engineering g a costs by  operating income for our oman business unit decreased  percent to  from  in the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to reduced revenue in as noted previously 
our contract margins decreased percent year over year  negatively impacting operating income 
these reductions were the result of fewer work orders and qualified prospects compounded by a more competitive bidding environment 
these decreases were partially offset by a reduction of overall business unit g a costs of operating income for our other international business units decreased  percent to a loss of  from a loss of  in these costs are primarily related to international new business development and pursuing new opportunities  as well as the proposal costs associated with submitting multiple qualified bids 
in the third quarter of  we were awarded the gmra project in libya 
we expect to recognize revenue on this project in downstream oil gas operating income increased  percent to from a loss of  in  primarily from the  impairment charge taken in this increase is partially offset by an operating income decrease of  caused primarily by the previously discussed revenue variances  as well as declining margins across most business units 
construction services operating income decreased  percent to primarily as a result of the slow release of capital work 
tank services operating income decreased  percent to due to the slow release of capital work and fewer fixed price contract awards  which traditionally result in higher margins  in as compared to the reduction in fixed price work was caused by pricing pressures from our customers and also contributed to the  percent reduction in maintenance and turnaround operating income 
downstream engineering operating income decreased  to a loss of  as a result of our acquisition of wink in july downstream oil gas incurred  in other charges in  of which  occurred in the engineering business unit almost entirely related to lease impairment charges taken on wink s leased office space 

table of contents non operating items interest  net expense decreased percent to  from  in the decrease in net expense is the result of a decrease in interest expense of  primarily due to decreased capital lease obligations as a result of buy outs during the second quarter of  offset by  of decreased interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents due to declining interest rates throughout other  net income decreased  percent to a net income of from net income of  in the decrease was primarily a result of selling one of our fabrication facilities located in edmonton  alberta  canada  which resulted in a gain on sale of  during provision for income taxes decreased  percent to  from  in during  we recognized  of income tax expense on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  as compared to income tax expense of  on income from continuing operations before income taxes of  in the decrease in the provision for income taxes is due to the decrease in operating income recognized during and a decrease in effective tax rate primarily due to the reversal of uncertain tax positions

upstream oil gas operating income increased  percent to  from an operating income of  in the increase in operating income is the result of previously discussed revenue increases with increasing margins for the segment 
slightly higher margins in the united states combined with a significant increase in revenue accounted for the majority of the increase in operating income 
due to an increase in volume on pipeline work related to the acquisition of midwest  margins in canada improved

additionally  we issue surety bonds customarily required by commercial terms on construction projects 
us surety bonds represent the bond penalty amount of future payments we could be required to make if we fail to perform our obligations under such contracts 
the surety bonds do not have a stated expiration date  rather  each is released when the contract is accepted by the owner 
our maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced 
as of december   no liability has been recognized for letters of credit or surety bonds 
a summary of our off balance sheet commercial commitments for both continuing and discontinued operations as of december  is as follows expiration per period total less than more than commitment year years years letters of credit us performance canada performance other performance and retention total letters of credit us surety bonds primarily performance total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with note  summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
revenue a number of factors relating to our business affect the recognition of contract revenue 
we typically structure contracts as unit price  time and materials  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work  cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
revenue from unit price and time and materials contracts is recognized as earned 
revenue for fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs  taking into consideration physical completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
certain fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts include  or are amended to include  incentive bonus amounts  contingent on accomplishing a stated milestone 
revenue attributable to incentive bonus amounts is recognized when the risk and uncertainty surrounding the achievement of the milestone have been removed 
we do not recognize income on a fixed price contract until the contract is approximately five to ten percent complete  depending upon the nature of the contract 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 

table of contents we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved changed orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than the cost related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and recognized income not yet billed on the balance sheet 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is subject to adjustment in subsequent periods to reflect the changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
income taxes the financial accounting standards board fasb standard for income taxes takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of  with no offsetting valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities of  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets in determination of our valuation allowance and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
the provision or benefit for income taxes and the annual effective tax rate are impacted by income taxes in certain countries being computed based on a deemed profit rather than on taxable income and tax holidays on certain international projects 
goodwill and other intangible assets we utilize the purchase accounting method for business combinations and record intangible assets separate from goodwill 
the fasb standard on goodwill stipulates a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
we do not have any other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we do have other intangible assets with finite lives 
these other intangible assets consist of customer relationships and backlog recorded in connection with the acquisition of inserv in november and customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements recorded in connection with the acquisition of the engineering business of wink  in july the value of existing customer relationships from the inserv and wink acquisitions was recorded at the estimated fair value determined by using a discounted cash flow method 
such acquired customer relationships have a finite useful life and are therefore being amortized over the estimated useful life of the relationships 
additionally  we were able to assign values to the trademarks and non compete agreements purchased in the wink acquisition 
the trademarks and non compete agreements were recorded at their fair value and are being amortized over the useful life of the contracts 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting standards for goodwill 
for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
significant assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the evaluation of our long lived assets 
according to accounting standards for goodwill  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually 
we conduct our annual evaluations during the fourth quarter 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
the underlying assumptions used for determining fair value are susceptible to change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about future revenues and operating costs  the amount and timing of anticipated capital expenditures  discount rates  inflation rates  and economic conditions require significant judgment 
we have  in goodwill as of december   of which  relates to our downstream oil gas segment and  relates to our upstream oil gas segment 
for our impairment analysis  we estimate the fair value of goodwill using the discounted cash flows methodology and an analysis of comparable companies 
the principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected results of operations  weighted average cost of capital wacc and terminal value assumptions 
this analysis required the input of several critical assumptions including future growth rates  cash flow projections  wacc  operating cost escalation rates  rate of return  terminal value assumptions and long term earnings and merger multiples for comparable companies in both the upstream and downstream markets 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of the company s consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
we believe the goodwill amounts reflect the value of the relatively stable  long lived cash flows of both businesses  considering the current environment and market growth potential 
the results of the analysis show the downstream oil gas segment with a carrying value of  as of december   compared to a fair value of  the fair value exceeds the carrying value by percent  therefore  we did not record an impairment 
additionally  the upstream oil gas segment has a carrying value of  as of december   compared to a fair value of  the fair value exceeds the carrying value by percent  therefore  we did not record an impairment 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb officially launched the fasb accounting standards codification the codification  which has become the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental  us gaap  in addition to guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
the codification is designed to simplify us gaap into a single  topically ordered structure 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
the codification is effective for all interim and annual periods ending after september  implementation of the codification did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents on january   we adopted an update to accounting standards related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
this update requires us to separately account for the debt and equity components of our notes and notes in a manner that reflects their nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance 
therefore  we estimated the fair value  as of the date of issuance  of our notes and notes as if the instruments were issued without the conversion option feature 
the difference between the fair value and the principal amounts of the instruments was  this amount was retrospectively recorded as a debt discount and as a component of equity 
the discounts are being amortized over seven and five year periods for the notes and notes  respectively  which resulted in additional non cash interest expense in historical and future periods 
our cash obligations have not changed as a result of the adoption of this standard 
the presentation and disclosure requirements have been applied retrospectively for all periods presented related to this standard 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note long term debt in item of this form k for more information on the retrospective application of this standard 
on january   we adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard  which established new accounting  reporting  and disclosure standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the standard requires expanded disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of our owners and the interests of the noncontrolling owners previously referred to as minority interests of a subsidiary 
the presentation and disclosure requirements have been applied retrospectively for all periods presented related to this standard 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in item of this form k for more information regarding the retrospective application of this standard 
on january   we adopted an update related to determining the useful life of intangible assets 
this update amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under previously existing literature 
the objective of this guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under the fasb s standard on intangibles goodwill and other  the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under the fasb s standard on business combinations  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted an update to existing accounting standards for business combinations 
the update establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest and the goodwill acquired 
additionally  transaction costs that were previously capitalized under current preceding guidance are now required to be expensed as incurred 
the update also establishes disclosure requirements which enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
in april  the fasb issued a further update in relation to accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  which amends the previous guidance to require contingent assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period 
if fair value cannot be reasonably estimated during the measurement period  the contingent asset or liability would be recognized in accordance with standards and guidance on accounting for contingencies and reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss 
further  this update eliminated the specific subsequent accounting guidance for contingent assets and liabilities  without significantly revising the original guidance 
however  contingent consideration arrangements of an acquiree assumed by the acquirer in a business combination would still be initially and subsequently measured at fair value 
these updates are effective for all business acquisitions occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted the provisions of these updates for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after january   which included our acquisition of wink 
in september  the fasb issued a new accounting standard for fair value measurements  which is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair value  establishing a framework for measuring fair value  and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the standard related to financial assets and liabilities and to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an update to the new standard for fair value measurements that provided guidance on the application of the new standard to other standards that address fair value measurements for the purposes of lease classification or measurement 
this update removes certain leasing transactions from the scope of the new accounting standard for fair value measurement 
further  an additional update was issued which defers the effective date of the new standard for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 

table of contents in october  the fasb also issued an update to the original standard related to determining the fair values of a financial asset when the market for the asset is not active  which clarifies the application of the fair value measurement standard in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for financial asset is not active 
on january   we adopted the provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  which include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  indefinite lived intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment  nonfinancial long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value  and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb further updated the fair value measurement standard to provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
our adoption of this guidance did not affect our consolidated financial statements 
on june   we adopted the provisions of a new accounting standard relating to subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
on june   we adopted an update to accounting standards for disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which requires publicly traded companies to provide disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides amendments to previous guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this standard clarifies the characteristics that identify a variable interest entity vie and changes how a reporting entity identifies a primary beneficiary that would consolidate the vie from a quantitative risk and rewards calculation to a qualitative approach based on which variable interest holder has controlling financial interest and the ability to direct the most significant activities that impact the vie s economic performance 
this statement requires the primary beneficiary assessment to be performed on a continuous basis 
it also requires additional disclosures about an entity s involvement with a vie  restrictions on the vie s assets and liabilities that are included in the reporting entity s consolidated balance sheet  significant risk exposures due to the entity s involvement with the vie  and how its involvement with a vie impacts the reporting entity s consolidated financial statements 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt the standard on january   but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation and changing prices our operations are affected by increases in prices  whether caused by inflation  government mandates or other economic factors  in the countries in which we operate 
we attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor  equipment  fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk is our exposure to changes in non us primarily canada currency exchange rates 
we attempt to negotiate contracts which provide for payment in us dollars  but we may be required to take all or a portion of payment under a contract in another currency 
to mitigate non us currency exchange risk  we seek to match anticipated non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency whenever possible 
to the extent we are unable to match non us currency revenue with expense in the same currency  we may use forward contracts  options or other common hedging techniques in the same non us currencies 
we had no forward contracts or options at december  and the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at december  due to the generally short maturities of these items 
at december   we invested primarily in short term dollar denominated bank deposits 
we have the ability and expect to hold our investments to maturity 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings under the credit facility 
at december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility subject to variable interest rates
