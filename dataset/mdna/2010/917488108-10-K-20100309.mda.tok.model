item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
overview despite a decline in consolidated sales and eps in  utmd continued excellent overall profitability 
the profitability allowed the company to achieve its roe objective  and continue utmd s consistent long term program of providing excellent shareholder returns including payment of dividends and share repurchases 
measures of the company s liquidity and overall financial condition improved in on an already strong condition at the end of for example  utmd s current ratio current assets to current liabilities increased to  and its total debt ratio total liabilities to total assets decreased to 
ending days in accounts receivable were just  and a r over days from invoice date were of total receivables 
consolidated global sales were down  most of the decline was due to weaker international business 
whereas international sales increased at an annually compounded rate of for the previous four years  they were down in sales in to utmd s largest international customer in were down  accounting for of the net total sales decline 
utmd expects that a partial recovery in sales to this international customer  based on orders already received in  will allow international sales to once again lead sales growth in notwithstanding  there are a number of significant risk factors that may negatively impact utmd s international sales in  with an unpredictable magnitude the liquidity of utmd s trading partners  the strength and timing of economic recovery in overseas markets  the value of the us dollar in foreign exchange  changes in us government trade policies and the resulting reactions of other governments  particularly if the us becomes more protectionist  and changes in international regulatory requirements and possible restrictions for medical devices  particularly in china  among other factors 
utmd s ireland subsidiary shipped of utmd s total international sales in compared to in this represented of utmd s global sales in  and created of utmd s consolidated earnings before income taxes ebt 
this compares to of global sales and of ebt in after a year of coping with excess resources  utmd did reduce the size of its workforce in ireland by near the end of  which it believes  combined with higher sales in  will return utmd ireland profitability closer to results 
domestic sales  comprised of domestic oem and domestic direct sales  declined or about 
the domestic oem sales were down because sales of molded components to customers outside the medical device industry by utmd s oregon facility were down 
the oregon oem sales  which at about of total sales have been a small part of utmd s business  have been useful in covering the extra overhead costs in oregon 
utmd s utah oem sales in were up 
the consolidation of the oregon operations into utah during the first half of will lead to better us manufacturing overhead absorption and improved gross profit margins beginning later in domestic direct sales declined  also by 
this was primarily due to a continued decline in sales of utmd s flagship intrauterine pressure monitoring device used in l d units of hospitals  intran plus 
domestic intran sales were down or compared to there were three reasons for the decline lower utilization rates of iupcs which are used to actively manage vaginal births  as evidenced by higher c section rates in the us  restrictive group purchasing organization gpo contracts that require member hospitals to buy cheaper devices without regard for physician preference or total costs of care including complications  and lower average selling prices for intran plus in response to a competitive environment 
the last reason explained only a half percentage point of the ten percent decline 
after noting that declining utilization rates of specialty medical devices in us hospitals may be a more permanent phenomenon for the foreseeable future  utmd also reduced its manufacturing workforce in utah by in second half the financial benefit of this utah reduction began to be realized in gross profit margins in late q utmd also increased its capital spending for manufacturing tooling and equipment in by about relative to  which will help lower manufacturing costs in in response to restrictive gpo practices  increasing hospital administration limitations on face to face meetings with clinicians and changing medical device sourcing and ordering practices  utmd s sales and marketing resources have been restructured to meet the changing conditions 
as a result  operating expenses in were less than of sales  and will be similarly managed in net profits in were substantially squeezed by lower non operating income compared to  and a higher income tax provision rate which was more than one and a half percentage points of ebt earnings before taxes higher than in the lower non operating income resulted primarily from lower interest rates on utmd s excess cash deposits and lack of royalty income 
the higher tax provision rate was due primarily to a smaller portion of consolidated taxable income generated in ireland at lower income tax rates 
due to a slow economic recovery  utmd expects that its non operating income may be even lower in  but still targets a net profit margin of about of sales in productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  in the increase was due primarily to a  increase in cash and investments provided by profitable operations 
in  utmd repurchased  of its shares for and paid  in dividends to shareholders 
in  utmd used its cash to repurchase  of its shares for  and pay  in dividends to shareholders 
productivity of total assets average total asset turns total sales divided by average total assets for the year was compared to in both years asset turns were diminished by utmd s substantial cash equivalent balances 
year end and cash and investment balances were  and  representing and of total assets  respectively 
utmd also used its cash generated in ireland in to reduce the principle balance of the ireland subsidiary loan by excluding average cash and investment balances  average total asset turns were in compared to in in  total assets excluding cash and investment balances are expected to remain less than annual sales  which benefits return on average shareholders equity roe 
mitigating the increase in assets was a decrease in receivables due to lower sales activity and better a r collections performance 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  oregon and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software and the utah and ireland facilities 
utmd leases the oregon facility as a result of the cmi acquisition  and a portion of its midvale  utah parking lot 
in  net consolidated pp e depreciated book value of all fixed assets increased as a result of in depreciation  capital expenditures of and the effect of currency exchange rates on pp e in ireland 
the net book value of pp e in the us increased  and in ireland decreased the year end net book value after accumulated depreciation of consolidated pp e was of actual acquisition cost 
since utmd s pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity  the continued productivity of fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability 
in  the utah facility will be expanded to house the transfer of oregon equipment 
as a result  new pp e purchases are expected to exceed depreciation of fixed assets by as much as average inventory turns were despite lower sales 
net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances decreased or about while sales activity decreased 
the resulting average days in a r on december  of days  based on q shipments  was down significantly from days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date at year end were of total a r  down from at the end of the company believes the older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end both of those amounts exceed utmd s working capital needs for internally financing growth in normal operations 
utmd s current ratio increased to from due to a  increase in current assets while current liabilities remained about the same 
cash and investments increased a combined  after falling  during the primary difference was utmd s use of just in to repurchase its own shares  compared to  used during to repurchase shares 
although the current ratio in may be diminished by use of cash for share repurchases or an acquisition or other substantial investment in pp e  utmd expects that current assets will continue to be a healthy multiple of current liabilities 
net after accumulated amortization intangible assets  which are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  were  at the end of compared to  at the end of utmd s goodwill balance remained at  under current gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three acquisitions of  and continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business  representing of total sales in when including derivative new devices that ensued the acquisitions 
utmd does not expect the current intangible value of goodwill associated with the acquisitions to become impaired in purchases of other intangibles of in were offset by in amortization expense 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets compared to at the end of b liabilities 
in  utmd s total liabilities decreased from the end of the resulting ending total debt ratio was 
total liabilities decreased by while total assets increased by 
the total debt ratio was at the end of current liabilities remained about the same as at the end of the ireland subsidiary note payable  which is payable in euros  declined in usd book value compared to actual principal payments of the difference results from currency exchange in the value of the usd compared to the euro 
in euro terms all euro amounts in this report are in thousands  the note payable declined from  at the end of to  at the end of as a reminder to shareholders  the note was initiated in december to finance repatriation of profits achieved in ireland since through under the american jobs creation act of utmd ltd 
ireland estimates that it will repay this note from profits generated by its operations over the next three to four years 
in addition to liabilities on the balance sheet  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales in were  compared to  in and  in domestic sales were  in  compared to  in and  in utmd divides its domestic sales into two distribution categories direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct domestic sales were in both and  and in therefore  domestic oem sales were of total domestic sales in both and  and in domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales in  compared to in and in international foreign sales in were  compared to  in and  in international sales were of global consolidated sales in  in and in of the international sales  were to customers in europe compared to in both and ireland operations utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd ltd 
trade shipments were down in euro terms  and down in usd terms  in compared to utmd groups its sales into four general product categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial sampling  transvaginal uterine sonography  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal critical care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including providing vascular access  enteral feeding  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors enjoy a significant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a summary description of revenues in the above tables obstetrics 
the decline in total obstetrics l d device sales in was primarily the result of the restrictive effects of us gpo administrative agreements 
for example  gpo restrictions included a sole source contract consummated by healthtrust purchasing group hpg with a utmd competitor for iupcs and vads which took effect on september  these specialty catheters and surgical tools are clearly in the category of clinician preference products 
the hpg sole source agreement violates the mandate by the us senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee in april that gpos only allow multi source contracting for clinician preference products  as well as the ensuing healthcare group purchasing industry initiative code of ethics  of which hpg was a founding member 
it also represented a violation of hpg s own code of ethics  which states in section hpg  no gpo should come between hospital administration and their physicians when it comes to the choice of medical devices needed to treat the patient 
to this end  healthtrust offers a complete line of contracts in these areas 
clinician preference products 
that provides substantial choice to our members and their physicians 
in the us  sales of intran plus intrauterine pressure catheters iupcs declined and sales of cmi vacuum assisted delivery systems vads declined about of the iupc decline resulted from lower prices 
the silver lining of this decline is that the company s reliance on a single product is much less concentrated  ie  in  us iupc sales were of total sales compared to when us iupc sales were of total sales 
domestic gynecology electrosurgery urology es gyn product sales increased  while international es gyn sales declined 
as a result of the american society for colposcopy and cervical pathology asccp revised guidelines for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  which advised greater monitoring of lower grade lesions in lieu of surgical treatment  utmd observed approximately a decline in use of letz electrodes from a consistent gynecology customer base 
the effect of the new guidelines now seems to have stabilized 
neonatal critical care device nicu sales increased internationally and decreased in the us in the us  because products in this category are sold to hospitals  sales are affected by gpo restrictions 
however  because nicu devices are more diverse and lower volume than in l d  and because of the special nature of the patients  utmd believes that clinicians remain more heavily involved in product selection 
therefore  us gpo administrative deals are less of a challenge in supplying specialty nicu devices than for l d 
blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm 
us bpm sales increased  while international bpm sales decreased  
sales in to utmd s largest international customer were down by  representing about of utmd s total sales decline of  virtually all of utmd s domestic oem sales were included in the bpm category in domestic oem sales decreased compared to this category includes molded components some of which are not related to medical devices sold to other companies for use in their products 
in contrast to the other product categories  international sales of bpm devices comprise most in and in of utmd s bpm sales 
utmd s bpm sales depend heavily on successful marketing by international distributors and oems 
due to a stronger us dollar and a general economic downturn  utmd experienced slowing of international distributor orders for bpm products in mainly because utmd s largest international customer started ordering bpm kits again in late  utmd expects an increase in international bpm sales in looking forward to  utmd s improvement in domestic direct sales depends on its ability to obtain medical staff involvement in purchasing decisions for utmd s physician preference products used in us hospitals where administrators are making the product decisions through the use of gpos contracts awarded on bases which may not adequately take into consideration the total cost of patient care  which includes complication rates and longer term health outcomes 
an important factor in utmd s ability to compete in this administratively cumbersome environment is its continuing ability to develop devices that are clearly differentiated on the basis of patient safety and better health outcomes 
excluding the possibility of acquisition of a new product line with established sales  management projects overall revenues in about the same as in this assumes a continued decline in us hospital utilization rates of specialty medical devices and an increase in international sales of about 
b gross profit 
utmd s gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in and in the gpm in was lower for several reasons because many of utmd s manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed in order to preserve capabilities  the lower consolidated sales activity in had a higher overhead content 
utmd did not reduce its experienced workforce until the latter part of the year  hoping for an improvement in demand by customers  particularly for ireland and oregon operations 
utmd maintains facilities and other manufacturing infrastructure well in excess of its current needs  which will help improve gpm when sales do increase 
the ireland subsidiary gross profits were disproportionately lower than total gross profits because the largest loss of sales occurred in ireland manufactured devices 
adjustments in the workforce did not occur until december ireland subsidiary gross profits in euros were in compared to in and in the associated gpms were in  in and in because of competition and a number of long term fixed pricing agreements  utmd had a limited ability to increase its product prices in  at the same time direct labor and direct materials costs increased fairly substantially 
as a result of the transition expenses of consolidating oregon operations into utah  continued pricing pressure by us hospitals and growth in sales coming primarily from lower margin international business  utmd does not expect to achieve expansion in its gpm until utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating income 
operating income is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
combined operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in the following table provides a comparison of operating expense categories for the last three years 
r d expenses s m expenses g a a litigation expense provision g a b corporate legal expenses g a c stock option compensation expense g a d management bonus accrual g a e outside accounting audit tax expenses g a f all other expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating income in was  compared to  in and  in utmd s operating profit margin operating income divided by total sales was in  compared to in and in looking forward to  utmd projects an operating margin of about  as it expects minor increases in both revenues and operating expenses 
i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  processing orders  paying commissions to outside representatives and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing inside representatives and paying commissions to outside reps that solicit product sales and provide customer support across the us the decline in s m expenses primarily reflects fewer inside direct sales representatives 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in in  utmd intends to hold the ratio of s m expenses to total sales to about 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing premarketing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in both and utmd will continue to opportunistically invest in r d 
in  r d expenses should remain in the range of of sales 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  corporate risk management  protection of intellectual property and legal costs 
aggregate g a expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in except for the categories of g a expenses isolated in the table above  utmd s g a expenses have remained consistent over the last three years 
the following lettered items refer to the same g a subcategories in the table above a absent unforeseen litigation  utmd plans a lower litigation expense provision in b the higher corporate legal expenses were essentially due to the legal costs associated with the filing of sec form s  registration statement under the securities act of that year 
in  utmd expects routine expenses consistent with those in and c stock option expense in was calculated using a black scholes pricing model for unvested options 
please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
in  utmd expects option expense about lower than in d the main difference in management bonus accrual compared to and was due to the fact that utmd s ceo did not receive a management bonus 
accrued bonuses in will continue to depend both on utmd s overall performance and each individual s performance 
e utmd s personnel  fundamental business activities  internal control systems and financial reporting mechanisms have remained relatively unchanged over the last several years 
utmd s costs remain below these expenses incurred by most publicly traded companies 
management expects audit costs will be about the same as costs 
d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income noi includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest on the ireland bank loan  bank service fees and excise taxes 
noi was in  compared to in and  in utmd expects total noi will be approximately that estimate does not include the possibility of a failure of citibank that would require recognition of a capital loss 
the estimated noi may also be lower if utmd utilizes its invested cash for an acquisition  unexpected litigation costs or substantial share repurchases 
investment of excess cash 
investment income including gains and losses on sales in was  compared to in and  in in  average interest rates were much lower than prior years 
capital gains or losses and dividends from investments in common stocks were in  in and in the company holds investments in citigroup c and general electric ge common stock which together were about below their aggregate purchase price at the end of when purchased  these holdings at cost represented less than of utmd s total investment portfolio 
at the end of  they represented less than one half percent of utmd s total investment portfolio 
unless one or both of the companies fail  utmd will not sell the holdings at current prices  expecting that the current value is immaterial and they may recover somewhat in value 
therefore  utmd does not expect an associated noi loss which impacts earnings 
currently  of utmd s cash investments are being held in interest bearing money market securities yielding about royalties 
annual royalties received in were compared to in both and the and royalties came from the license of patents which expired during presently  there are no other patents under which utmd is receiving royalties from other parties 
interest expense 
in  utmd paid in interest expense on the ireland loan  compared to in and in the interest expense results from borrowing million  in december to allow the repatriation of profits generated by utmd s ireland subsidiary since inception in through due to a lower loan balance as well as expected continued low interest rates  utmd estimates that its interest expense may be about lower in other noi 
income received from renting underutilized warehouse space in ireland and parking lot space in utah for a cell phone tower  offset by bank fees and excise taxes  was in  in and in utmd expects other noi will be about in  primarily because of expected lower bank fees 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating income 
consolidated ebt was  in  compared to  in and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s ebt margin was in  in and in the ebt of utmd ltd 
was in  in and  in utmd is targeting consolidated ebt of about  as operating income is projected to be similar to and non operating income lower  resulting in an ebt margin between and 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was  in   in and  in the effective consolidated corporate income tax provision rate was  and for the same periods respectively 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate may result from variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products and a rate on rental and other types of income  special us tax exclusions such as the manufacturing profit deduction  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other permanent factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects the consolidated income tax provision rate to be close to the rate 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales was in  in and in utmd s profitability has consistently ranked it in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been a primary driver for utmd s past excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were in  in and in if utmd achieves the projections above  eps in will be approximately the same as in the ending weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands  compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was shares in thousands  compared to in and in actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe for was before dividends  compared to excluding the fifth dividend payment in  which would normally have been paid in january before dividends  in and before dividends in utmd s roe is primarily driven by its high net profit margin  which in declined to from in roe was also reduced by a lower debt ratio as utmd continued to reduce its bank loan balance in ireland  and by slightly lower total asset turns 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without diluting shareholder interest 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without having to issue more stock 
looking forward  unless utmd utilizes its cash to make an acquisition or repurchase shares  roe will be lower than because the net profit margin is projected to be slightly lower while financial leverage and asset utilization remain about the same 
retaining a high cash balance which returns less than dilutes overall roe 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities in was lower due to net income being lower than in mitigating that decrease was a larger increase in accrued expenses 
other changes were generally consistent with effective balance sheet management in the presence of lower sales activity 
the company s use of cash for investing activities was primarily as a result of purchases of liquid investments in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining safety and liquidity 
utmd expended  in on such purchases  compared to  in and  in in  utmd received  from selling short term investments  compared to  in and  in no acquisitions requiring investment of cash were made in any of the three years 
in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
employees exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options 
the company received a tax benefit from option exercises in utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in comparison  in utmd received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options  including  shares retired upon optionees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon optionees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
utmd received a tax benefit in from option exercises  and a benefit of in utmd did not borrow during  or in december  utmd s foreign subsidiary borrowed million  to allow repatriation from ireland to the us of profits achieved since  per the american jobs creation act of in  the bank of ireland loan terms were modified to no longer require a guarantee by utmd s line of credit in the us in  utmd made repayments of on the ireland note  compared to  in and  in dividends paid to shareholders were higher in because utmd accelerated into december the dividend payment that normally would have been made in  resulting in five dividend payments in a similar acceleration was made at the end of  which resulted in four dividend payments in management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
in an uncertain economic environment  utmd s cash balances allow management to operate with the long term best interest of shareholders in mind 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be higher than during the past three years as utmd s utah facility will be expanded to consolidate operations previously located in oregon 
in addition  utmd may use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases when the price of the stock is undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
in summary  management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following to invest in new facilities and equipment at an opportune time that will enhance future profitability  to make investments in new technology and or processes  to acquire a product line that will augment revenue growth and better utilize utmd s existing infrastructure  and or to repurchase utmd shares in the open marketplace 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to work to retain its significant global market shares of established key specialty products  accelerate revenue growth of newer products  develop additional proprietary products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development  continue achieving excellent overall financial operating performance  look for accretive acquisitions to augment sales growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest  including continued cash dividends and open market share repurchases when the utmd share price seems undervalued 
the safety  reliability and performance of utmd s medical devices are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with clinicians who use its specialty devices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
utmd s passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks  particularly for women and their babies 
the company has a fundamental focus to do an excellent job in meeting customers and patients needs  while providing shareholders with excellent returns 
despite utmd s decline in eps over the last three years  looking back ten years to the end of  utmd s eps have more than doubled and the year ending share price has more than quadrupled 
combining this performance with steadily growing dividends since  longer term utmd shareholders have experienced excellent returns 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia indices all declined over that same ten year time span 
in  the year ending share price increased  essentially regaining the decline which occurred in  primarily near the end of that year 
utmd also increased dividends share by 
this was accomplished in by utmd continuing to achieve a high positive cash flow 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to be able to finance a substantial acquisition in without issuing stock  should an immediately accretive one become available 
shareholders may recall that utmd also has a shelf registration that gives it speed and flexibility in obtaining additional financing should an acquisition that exceeds current cash availability become available 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire reasonably valued  cash flow positive companies with established products or technologies that will enhance utmd s specialist focus  but not significantly increase business risk and not dilute financial performance 
off balance sheet arrangements none contractual obligations the following is a summary of utmd s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  long term debt obligations are comprised solely of future payments required to pay off the ireland note contractual obligations and commitments total and thereafter long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management has identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s receivables are with us hospitals and medical device distributors 
although the company has historically not had significant write offs of bad debt  the possibility exists  particularly with foreign customers where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread us hospital bankruptcies 
inventory valuation reserves the company strives to maintain a good balance of inventory to meets its customer s needs and optimize manufacturing lot sizes while not tying up an unnecessary amount of the company s capital increasing the possibility of  among other things  obsolescence 
the company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve 
while the company has historically not had significant inventory write offs  the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created 
the company s historical write offs have not been materially different from its estimates 
accounting policy changes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb changed the hierarchy of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap such that the newly released fasb accounting standards codification asc will replace other sources of authoritative gaap with the exception of rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission  which will continue to be authoritative 
the asc is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  and is not intended to significantly change gaap
