item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see disclosures regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview of our business we are an independent natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of primarily gas properties  mostly in the southwestern and appalachian regions of the united states 
we operate in one segment 
we have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to economically find  develop  acquire and produce oil and gas reserves 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
our corporate headquarters is located in fort worth  texas 
industry environment we operate entirely within the united states 
as traditional basins in the us have matured  exploration and production has shifted to unconventional resource plays  typically shale reservoirs that historically were not thought to be productive for oil and gas 
these plays cover large areas  provide multi year inventories of drilling opportunities and  with modern oil and gas technology  have sustainable lower risk growth profiles 
the economics of these plays have been enhanced by continued advancements in drilling and completion technologies 
these advancements make these plays more resilient to lower commodity prices while increasing the domestic supply of natural gas and  with increased supply  an expected reduction in the volatility of natural gas prices 
examples of such technological advancements include advanced d seismic processing  hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation using almost one hundred percent sand and water  advances in well logging and analysis  horizontal drilling and completion technologies and automated remote well monitoring and control devices 
oil and gas are commodities 
the price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand in the united states 
demand for natural gas in the united states increased substantially over the past years  however  the current economic slowdown has reduced this demand 
demand is impacted by general economic conditions  weather and other seasonal conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
over or under supply of natural gas can result in price volatility 
factors impacting the future supply balance are the growth in domestic gas production and the increase in the united states lng import capacity 
american gas supplies have increased as a result of recent expansion in domestic unconventional gas production 
existing lng capacity may result in lower natural gas prices 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
the reduced liquidity provided by the worldwide financial markets and other factors resulted in an economic slowdown in the united states and other industrialized countries in  which resulted in reductions in worldwide energy demand 
at the same time  north american gas supply has increased as a result of the expansion in domestic unconventional gas production 
the combination of lower demand due to the economic slowdown and higher north american gas supply has resulted in declines in natural gas prices from their highs in mid these circumstances have led to a decrease in drilling activity and reduced the demand for drilling rigs  oilfield supplies  tubulars and drill pipe 
during  we experienced lower overall industry costs  but these declines lagged behind the decline in prices 
the duration and magnitude of the commodity price declines cannot be predicted 

table of contents oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available to us for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce  revenues and profitability  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities 
any continued or extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and access to capital 
capital budget for our capital budget for is currently set at million  excluding acquisitions 
the capital budget is more than the capital spending levels with higher expected operating cash flows resulting from higher projected oil and gas prices and higher production 
for  we expect our cash flow and proceeds from asset sales to fund our capital budget 
as has been our historical practice  we will periodically review our capital expenditures throughout the year and adjust the budget based on commodity prices  drilling success and other factors 
source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of oil and gas that is produced from our properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced  the prevailing market price at the time of sale  quality  btu content and transportation costs to market 
production volumes and the price of oil and gas are the primary factors affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a substantial  but varying  portion of our gas and oil production 
the use of derivative instruments has in the past and may in the future  prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements but also protects us from declining price movements 
our average realized price calculations including all derivative settlements include both the effects of the settlement of derivative contracts that are accounted for as hedges and the settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges 
principal components of our cost structure direct operating expenses 
these are day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include maintenance  repairs and workovers expenses related to our oil and gas properties 
these costs  on an mcfe basis  are expected to continue to moderate in direct operating expenses also include stock based compensation expense non cash associated with grants of stock appreciation rights sars and the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
production and ad valorem taxes 
production taxes are paid on produced oil and gas based on a percentage of market prices not hedged prices or at fixed rates established by federal  state or local taxing authorities 
ad valorem taxes are generally based on reserve values at the end of each year 
exploration expenses 
these are geological and geophysical costs  including payroll and benefits for the geological and geophysical staff  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes 
exploration expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with grants of sars and the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
these costs include overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our production and development operations  franchise taxes  audit and other professional fees and legal compliance 
general and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with grants of sars and the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
abandonment and impairment of unproved properties 
this category includes unproved property impairment and costs associated with lease expirations 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with our longer term debt securities 
as a result  we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we will likely continue to incur interest expense as we continue to grow 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization 
this includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this expense also includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on a basis other than federal taxable income 
currently  substantially all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  we anticipate using all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 
for additional information  see risk factors certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation  in item a of this report 
management s discussion and analysis of income and operations overview of results during  we achieved the following financial and operating results achieved production growth  achieved reserve growth  drilled net wells with a success rate  continued expansion of key plays by growing production  proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage  maintained a strong balance sheet by retaining a debt to capitalization ratio of and issuing million of new senior subordinated notes  received proceeds of million from asset sales  realized million of cash flow from operating activities  and ended the year with stockholders equity of billion 
our performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of growth through drilling 
during  we did not make a material acquisition of proved reserves 
instead  we acquired unproved acreage  primarily in the marcellus shale 
the business of exploring for  developing  and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing our operations are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
as a result of the drop in commodity prices  we have increased our efforts on improving our operating efficiency 
these efforts resulted in lower direct operating expense per mcfe for when compared to however  as we continue to expand our marcellus shale team to meet the needs of this developing asset  we have experienced upward pressure on our general and administrative costs per mcfe 
to mitigate this trend  we closed our gulf coast division office effective november  with those operations being combined and operated out of the southwest division in fort worth 
we successfully faced other challenges in  including accessing the capital markets to fund our growth on sufficiently favorable terms  continuing to introduce new extraction technologies into the marcellus shale and retaining qualified operational people despite our lower capital spending program 
we began the year in the midst of a worldwide economic decline and have taken several steps to improve our liquidity see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition cash flows and liquidity 
our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to provide new growth opportunities 
we continue to believe that our portfolio of long lived assets positions us for future growth 
total revenues decreased in over the same period of this decrease was due to lower realized oil and gas prices somewhat offset by higher production 
our production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program 
average realized prices including all derivative settlements were lower in as discussed in item a of this report  significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a material impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations  including the fair value of our derivatives 

table of contents outlook for  the board has approved a million capital budget for oil and gas related activities  excluding proved property acquisitions 
we expect to fund our capital budget expenditures with cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales 
the price risk on a portion of our forecasted oil and gas production for is mitigated using commodity derivative contracts and we intend to continue to enter into these transactions 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production are largely based on current market prices  which are beyond our control 
we announced our plan to offer for sale our tight gas sand properties in ohio and the data room opened in january these properties include approximately  producing wells   net acres of leasehold and  miles of pipeline and gathering system infrastructure 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell these assets for a price of million  subject to typical post closing adjustments 
the completion of the sale is dependent upon prospective buyer due diligence procedures and there can be no assurance the sale will be completed 
oil and gas sales  production and realized price calculations our oil and gas sales vary from year to year as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes 
hedges included in oil and gas sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting 
cash settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in the statement of operations in derivative fair value income loss 
oil and gas sales decreased from due to a decrease in realized prices  partially offset by a increase in production 
oil and gas sales in increased from due to a increase in production and an increase in realized prices 
the following table illustrates the primary components of oil and gas sales for each of the last three years in thousands oil and gas sales oil wellhead oil hedges realized total oil revenue gas wellhead gas hedges realized total gas revenue total ngl revenue combined wellhead combined hedges total oil and gas sales our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells into production and through additions from acquisitions  partially offset by the natural decline of our oil and gas wells and asset sales 
for  our production volumes increased in the appalachian region and in the southwestern region 
crude oil production declined from primarily due to the sale of certain oil properties in west texas 
for  our production volumes increased in the appalachian region  increased in our southwestern region and increased in our gulf coast region

derivative fair value income loss was a gain of million in compared to a gain of million in and a loss of million in some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income loss 
mark to market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark to market value of our derivatives 
any gains on our derivatives will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future or any losses will be offset by higher wellhead revenues based on the value at the settlement date 
at december   our derivative contracts are recorded at their fair value  which is a net asset of million  a decrease of 
table of contents million from the million asset recorded as of december  most of the year end net asset was related to derivative contracts  therefore  this decrease is primarily related to the settlement of these contracts 
we have also entered into basis swap agreements to limit volatility caused by changing differentials between index and regional prices received 
these basis swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting purposes and are marked to market 
hedge ineffectiveness  also included in derivative fair value income loss  is associated with contracts that qualify for hedge accounting 
the ineffective portion is calculated as the difference between the change in the fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in future cash flows from item hedged 
the following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value income loss for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in thousands change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting a realized gain loss on settlements gas b c realized gain loss on settlements oil b c hedge ineffectiveness realized c unrealized a derivative fair value income loss a these amounts are unrealized and are not included in average sales price calculations

other revenue decreased in to  compared to million in and million in the period includes a million gain on the sale of marcellus acreage and a million lawsuit settlement offset by a non cash loss from equity method investments of million 
the period includes a million gain on the sale of assets and a non cash loss from equity method investments of  the period includes non cash income from equity method investments of  and other miscellaneous income

in  this effect was more than offset by lower overall industry costs  lower workover expenses and asset sales 
on an absolute dollar basis  our spending for direct operating expenses is lower when compared to despite higher production levels reflecting cost containment measures and lower overall industry costs 
we incurred million of workover costs in compared to million in and million in on a per mcfe basis  direct operating expense for decreased or from the same period of with the decrease consisting primarily of lower workover costs per mcfe  lower utility costs per mcfe  lower well service costs  asset sales and our focus on cost containment

stock based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and sars grants 
these costs are increasing due to increasing grant date fair values and an increase in the number of grants on our increasing employee base 
exploration expense was million in compared to million in and million in the following table details our exploration related expenses for  and exploration expense was significantly lower in when compared to due to our focus on development of our large shale and coal bed methane projects and the closure of our gulf coast office 
the increase in exploration expense from to reflects higher seismic and personnel costs due  in part  to the early stages of the marcellus shale development

this increase is primarily due to the significant increase in lease acquisition costs over the past three years and increased leasing activity in new areas that require several years to delineate along with lower oil and gas prices which resulted in reduced drilling activity 
as we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment  additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded 
deferred compensation plan expense was a loss of million in compared to a gain of million in and a loss of million in our stock price increased to at december  compared to at december  this non cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense 
the year ended decreased million from the same period of due to a decline in our stock price  which decreased from at december  to at december  during  our stock price increased from at december  to at december  
table of contents income tax benefit expense was a benefit of million in compared to expense of million in and expense of million in the decrease reflects a decrease in income from continuing operations compared to the same period of the year ended also includes an unfavorable million charge to reflect updated state tax rates used in establishing deferred taxes due to a change in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states  particularly in pennsylvania due to our increased focus on development of the marcellus shale along with increased proved reserves and acreage in pennsylvania

in a continuing effort to mitigate the effect of the deterioration in the capital markets and the decline in oil and gas commodity prices which began in mid  we took additional measures in to enhance our liquidity 
in may  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due  at a discount 
we used the million of proceeds received from the issuance of these senior subordinated notes to repay outstanding bank debt  increasing the availability of our credit line 
also in  we entered into commodity derivative contracts covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
these contracts expire through december we also sold oil and gas properties in west texas and new york for million with the proceeds used to repay outstanding bank debt 
our capital spending was significantly reduced in all areas except our marcellus shale operations 
as part of our semi annual bank review completed september   our borrowing base and facility amounts were reaffirmed at billion and billion 
the borrowing base represents the amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets and liabilities while the bank commitment or facility amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the credit agreement 
during  our net cash provided from continuing operations of million and proceeds from the sale of assets of million were used to fund million of capital expenditures including acquisitions and equity investments 
at december   we had  in cash and total assets of billion 
our debt to capitalization ratio was 
as of december  and  our total debt and capitalization were as follows in thousands bank debt senior subordinated notes and other total debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization ratio long term debt at december  totaled billion  including million of bank credit facility debt and billion of senior subordinated notes 
our available committed borrowing capacity at december  was million 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves 
we currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas 
table of contents price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs 
however  long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and remain profitable 
we operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
our ability to expand our reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  bank borrowings  asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves 
our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward looking statements are based on currently available information 
if this information proves to be inaccurate  future availability of financing may be adversely affected 
factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance  the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets  investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance  the global financial climate and  in particular  with respect to borrowings  the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies 
for additional information  see risk factors difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in item a of this report 
credit arrangements we maintain a billion revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on october  availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances 
the borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of rds of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at february   the bank credit facility had a billion borrowing base and a billion facility amount 
remaining credit availability was million on february  our bank group is comprised of twenty six commercial banks  with no one bank holding more than of the bank credit facility 
we believe our large number of banks and relatively low commitment levels allows for sufficient lending capacity should we elect to increase our billion commitment up to the billion borrowing base and also allows for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector 
our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes 
the debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence  working capital  dividends and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  cash flow cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives 
our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital 
we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility 
because of this  and since our principal source of operating cash flows or proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  we often have low or negative working capital 
we sell substantially all of our oil and gas production at the wellhead under floating market contracts 
however  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next to months 
any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production 
production receipts  however  often lag payments to the counterparties 
any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility 
as of december   we have entered into hedging agreements covering bcfe for and bcfe for net cash provided from continuing operations in was million compared to million in and million in cash provided from operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production  net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts 
the decrease in cash provided from operating activities from to reflects lower price realizations a decline of somewhat offset by a increase in production 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due to increased production from acquisitions and development activity and higher price realizations 
as of december   we have hedged approximately of our projected production and of our projected production 
net cash provided from continuing operations is also

in addition   shares of stock were issued in exchange for marcellus shale unproved acreage 
our capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded by net cash flow from operations  proceeds from asset sales and issuance of equity 
our capital expenditure budget for is currently set at million  excluding acquisitions 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the near term  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow and asset sales 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a continued drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting the amount up or down and also between our operating regions  depending on commodity prices  cash flow and projected returns 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
cash dividend payments the amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and primarily depends on cash flow and capital expenditures 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders per share in each quarter 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders per share in each quarter 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders per share in the fourth quarter and per share in the third  second and first quarters 
cash contractual obligations our contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases  drilling commitments  derivative obligations  asset retirement obligations and transportation commitments 
as of december   we do not have any capital leases nor have we entered into any material long term contracts for equipment 
as of december   we do not have any significant off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any unrelated party 
as of december   we had a total of  of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit facility 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below  our balance sheet at december  reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of  which is payable in first quarter we expect to make interest payments of million per year on our senior subordinated notes  million per year on our senior subordinated notes  million per year on our senior subordinated notes due  million per year on our senior subordinated notes due  million per year on our senior subordinated notes and million per year on our senior subordinated notes 
the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facility  additional debt issuances and proceeds from asset sales in thousands

b derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of december  while such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received after our payments to counterparties  which can result in borrowings under our bank credit facility 
c the ultimate settlement and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance 
d this table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets 
in addition to the amounts included in the above table  we have contracted with several pipeline companies through to deliver natural gas production volumes in appalachia from certain marcellus shale wells 
the agreements call for total incremental increases of  mmbtu per day over the  mmbtu per day at december  these increases  which are contingent on certain pipeline modifications  are for  mmbtu per day in march   mmbtu per day in july   mmbtu per day in november and an additional  mmbtu per day for november delivery commitments under a sales agreement  we have an obligation to deliver  mmbtu per day of volume at various delivery points within the barnett shale basin 
the contract  which began in  extends for five years ending march as of december   remaining volumes to be delivered under this commitment are approximately bcf 
our proved reserves in the barnett shale are sufficient to fulfill these delivery commitments 
hedging oil and gas prices we use commodity based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations 
we do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes 
we do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions  knockouts or extendable swaps 
we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans 
while there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising oil and gas prices may not be captured  we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important 
among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions  the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital  smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs  more consistent returns on invested capital  and better access to bank and other credit markets 
at december   we had collars covering bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of to and million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of to 
their fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination  based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  approximated a pretax gain of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december 
table of contents at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding period contract type volume hedged average hedge price natural gas collars  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day crude oil collars  bbls day in addition to the collars above  we have entered into basis swap agreements 
the price we receive for our production can be less than nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments 
the fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre tax loss of million at december  interest rates at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged at year end the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under cash contractual obligations 
inflation and changes in prices our revenues  the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business 
in a trend that began in and accelerated through the middle of  commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly 
the higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and  consequently  rising costs 
these cost trends put pressure on our operating costs and also on our capital costs 
due to the decline in commodity prices that began in the last half of and continued into  costs moderated in we expect costs in to continue to be a function of supply and demand

credit ratings we receive credit ratings from standard poor s ratings group  inc s p and moody s investor services  inc 
moody s  which are subject to regular reviews 
s p s corporate rating for us is bb with a stable outlook 
moody s corporate rating for us is ba with a stable outlook 
we believe that s p and moody s consider many factors in determining our ratings including production growth opportunities  liquidity  debt levels  asset  and proved reserve mix 
we also believe that the rating agencies take into consideration our size  corporate structure  the complexity of our capital structure and organization  and history of how we have chosen to finance our growth 
we believe that our single line of business  and practice of funding our growth with a balanced mix of long term debt and common equity positively impact our ratings 
in addition to qualitative and quantitative factors unique to range  we believe that the rating agencies consider various macro economic factors such as the projected future price of oil and gas  trends in industry service costs  and global supply and demand for energy 
based upon the factors influencing our credit ratings which are within our control  we are currently not aware of any reason why our credit rating would change materially from the present ratings 
a reduction in our debt ratings could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate  fees and other terms associated with such additional financing 

table of contents management s discussion of critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes  and b the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
oil and gas properties we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers 
costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and b we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
proven property leasehold costs are amortized to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves 
properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant at least annually and impairments to value are charged to expense 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the sec  including the recent rule revisions designed to modernize the oil and gas company reserves reporting requirements which we adopted effective december   the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price and cost changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates used by us 
we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior vice president of reservoir engineering who reports directly to our president 
for additional discussion  see proved reserves  in item of this report 
to further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates  we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves 
independent petroleum consultants reviewed of our reserves in compared to in and in historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 
the reserves included in this report are those reserves estimated by our employees and were based on a month average commodity price in accordance with sec rules 
depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs 
while total depletion expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing when depletion expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of depletion expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of depletion expense recognition 
based on proved reserves at december   we estimate that a change in proved reserves would increase or decrease depletion expense by approximately million assuming a production increase 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in note to our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
we adopted the new sec accounting and disclosure regulations for oil and gas companies effective december  which will be accounted for prospectively 
we estimate the effect of this change in estimate was an increase to depletion  depreciation and amortization expense in fourth quarter of approximately million primarily due to lower prices reflected in our estimated reserves 
we monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and gas properties in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  future abandonment costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  physical damage to production equipment and facilities  a change in costs  or other changes to contracts or environmental regulations 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the review is done by determining if the historical cost of proved properties less the applicable accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization is less than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows 
the expected future net cash flows are estimated based on our plans to produce and develop reserves 
expected future net cash inflow from the sale of production of reserves is calculated based on estimated future prices and estimated operating and development costs 
we estimate prices based upon market related information including published futures prices 
the estimated future level of production is based on assumptions surrounding future levels of prices and costs  field decline rates  market demand and supply  the economic and regulatory climates 
when the carrying value exceeds the sum of future net cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair market value as determined by discounted future net cash flows using a discount rate similar to market participants and the carrying value of the asset 
we cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 
our historical impairment of producing properties has been  in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in we believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impractical to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome 
we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions 
we evaluate our unproved property investment periodically for impairment 
the majority of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and evaluated at least quarterly as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
impairment of a significant portion of our unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period  expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success 
impairment of individually significant unproved property is assessed on a property by property basis considering a combination of time  geologic and engineering factors 
we continue to experience an increase in lease expirations caused by current economic conditions  which have impacted our future drilling plans thereby increasing the amount of lease expirations and our expansion in shale plays which involved acquisition of a significant acreage position prior to development 
unproved properties had a net book value of million in compared to million in and million in the increase from represents additional acreage purchases primarily in the marcellus and barnett shale 
we have recorded abandonment and impairment expense related to unproved properties of million in compared to million in and million in oil and gas derivatives every derivative instrument is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
all of our derivative instruments are issued to manage the price risk attributable to our expected oil and gas production 
in determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts  we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative 
our derivatives are measured using a market approach using third party pricing services which have been corroborated with data from active markets or broker quotes 
while we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivatives  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity 
the determination of fair values includes various factors including the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities and the credit standing of our counterparties 
our counterparties include twelve financial institutions  eleven of which are secured lenders in our bank credit facility 

table of contents through december  we have elected to designate our commodity derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges 
to designate a derivative as a cash flow hedge  we document at the hedge s inception our assessment that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the item hedged 
this assessment  which is updated at least quarterly  is based on the most recent relevant historical correlation between the derivative and the item hedged 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is calculated as the difference between the change in fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in cash flows from the item hedged 
if  during the derivative s term  we determine the hedge is no longer highly effective  hedge accounting is prospectively discontinued and any remaining unrealized gains or losses  based on the effective portion of the derivative at that date  are reclassified to earnings as oil or gas sales when the underlying transaction occurs 
if it is determined that the designated hedged transaction is not probable to occur  any unrealized gains or losses are recognized immediately in the statement of operations as derivative fair value income loss 
during  there were gains of million compared to losses of  in and losses of million in reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment for our derivatives 
we apply hedge accounting to qualifying derivatives used to manage price risk associated with our oil and gas production 
accordingly  we record changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts  including changes associated with time value  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci on our consolidated balance sheet 
gains or losses on these swap and collar contracts are reclassified out of aoci and into oil and gas sales when the underlying physical transaction occurs 
any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge which represents the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differs from the change in the cash flows of the forecasted sale of production is reported currently each period in derivative fair value income loss on our consolidated statement of operations 
ineffectiveness can be associated with open positions unrealized or can be associated with closed contracts realized 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method 
we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our consolidated statement of operations each period in derivative fair value income loss 
we also enter into basis swap agreements which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market 
the price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix our basis adjustments 
cash flows from our derivative contract settlements are reflected in cash flow provided from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of retirement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation  aro  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimate of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of the costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we increased our existing estimated asset retirement obligation by million or approximately of the asset retirement obligation at december  in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense  a component of depletion  depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit  which can take years to complete  and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 

table of contents in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require accumulated other comprehensive income to be considered  even though such income or loss has not yet been earned 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized hedging gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized hedging gains included in oci 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition oil  gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized when the products are sold and delivery to the purchaser has occurred 
we use the sales method to account for gas imbalances  recognizing revenue based on gas delivered rather than our working interest share of gas produced 
we recognize the cost of revenues  such as transportation and compression expense  as a reduction of revenue 
stock based compensation arrangements the fair value of stock options and stock settled sars is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the model employs various assumptions  based on management s best estimates at the time of the grant  which impact the fair value calculated and ultimately  the expense that is recognized over the life of the award 
we utilize historical data and analyze current information to reasonably support these assumptions 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
the expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and adjust it as circumstances warrant 
restricted stock awards are classified as a liability and are remeasured at fair value each reporting period with the resulting gain or loss recognized in deferred compensation plan expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
accounting standard not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued asc formerly sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity vie 
this standard also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is therefore required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
previously  the standard required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
this standard is effective for calendar year companies beginning in january  early adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard on our financial statements  but do not expect it to have a material effect 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
all accounts are us dollar denominated 

table of contents financial market risk the debt and equity markets have exhibited adverse conditions since late the unprecedented volatility and upheaval in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and may affect our ability to access those markets 
at this point  we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global markets and we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets 
additionally  we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our twenty six lenders in the bank credit facility 
see also item a 
risk factors 
market risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of oil and gas prices 
we employ various strategies  including the use of commodity derivative instruments  to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
we are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk we use commodity based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations 
we do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes 
we do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions  knockouts or extendable swaps 
at times  certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty 
at december   our derivatives program includes collars  which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price 
as of december   we had collars covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
these contracts expire monthly through december the fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of december   approximated a net unrealized pre tax gain of million 
at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding average fair period contract type volume hedged hedge price market value in thousands natural gas collars  mmbtu day  collars  mmbtu day  crude oil collars  bbl day 
table of contents other commodity risk we are impacted by basis risk  caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity 
natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets 
if commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions  derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge  resulting in increased basis risk 
in addition to the collars and swaps above  we have entered into basis swap agreements 
the price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments 
the fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre tax loss of million at december  the following table shows the fair value of our collars and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a change in commodity prices at december  we remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments  however  such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity 
the hypothetical change in fair value would be a gain or loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease in thousands hypothetical change in fair value fair value collars our commodity based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non performance by the counterparty to the contracts 
our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
our derivative counterparties include twelve financial institutions  eleven of which are secured lenders in our bank credit facility 
we have one counterparty that is not part of our bank group and three counterparties in our bank group with no master netting agreement 
j 
aron company is the counterparty not in our bank group 
at december   our net derivative receivable includes a payable to j 
aron company of million 
counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts 
while counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions  the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non performance by counterparty  which was immaterial 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt 
we attempt to balance variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs  interest rate volatility and financing risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  billion bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which was on that date 
on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest expense 
the fair value of our subordinated debt is based on year end quoted market prices
