our business strategy is to lead in the design  development and commercialization of high performance  innovative ultrasound technology and hcu systems 
we intend to sustain long term growth of our business through technological innovation  broadening of sales distribution channels  entering into and maintaining strategic relationships  expanding into new clinical and geographic markets  and delivering high quality products to customers 
we are focusing on the development of innovative products with the objective of improving patient care and efficiency through ease of use  high performance imaging  and providing quicker results to physicians and clinicians 
we also are investing in research and development in existing and new lines of business and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth 
recognizing that one of our greatest challenges is the current state of the global economy  we are focused on increasing sales force efficiency and effective cost management 
over the last few years  we have laid a foundation for long term growth by introducing innovative products  entering into strategic relationships  expanding into new markets  and providing high quality products with an industry leading year warranty 
in fiscal year  we plan to continue to build on this foundation and to execute well in key areas  including continuing to innovate using existing and new technologies  to build and maintain key relationships in the sales distribution channels  to improve sales force productivity  to deliver high quality products  and to manage expenses 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of cardiodynamics international corporation cdic  a leader in impedance cardiography icg for noninvasive hemodynamic assessment that develops  manufactures  and markets icg devices and sensors 
the icg product line provides non invasive assessment of cardiac output and other hemodynamic parameters 
the business combination enables us to expand our distribution platform and product offerings 
key opportunities include the following product innovation our products provide exceptional reliability  image quality  and ease of use in a lightweight design that can be either hand carried  used on a stand or mounted on a wall or ceiling 
we are committed to continuing to develop our next generation of products and expanding our existing product base by using new and existing technologies 
in fiscal year  we introduced the nanomaxx  which is based on our fourth generation product platform  and we acquired the bioz product line from cdic 
fiscal year will continue to see the release of new and innovative products 
strategic relationships and acquisitions we are focused on building relationships and acquiring products and technologies that will enable us to continue to develop markets within ultrasound or with ultrasound dependent technologies 
we believe that new relationships  products  and technologies can accelerate market penetration to customers not served by our direct sales force 
expansion of cardiovascular disease management cvdm and vascular access markets we intend to maximize growth in cvdm through the introduction of new products  expansion of our sales force and internationally 
we also intend to expand our presence in the vascular market through the growth of sales of nanomaxx  our most recently released product  and through the launch of our lumenvu technology into the vascular access market 

table of contents results of operations the unfavorable global economic environment adversely affected our business in fiscal year  as hospitals cut back or delayed capital spending 
our financial performance during reflected a decrease in revenue  operating income  and cash flow 
but because of our strong and growing product pipeline  we believe that we are well positioned to manage the continuing uncertainties surrounding the economy 
as the global economy recovers and as we enhance our product offerings and strategic alliances  we believe opportunities to increase revenue will grow 
the following financial information sets forth our results of operations and is derived from our consolidated financial statements in thousands year ended december  as adjusted as adjusted revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other loss income income before income taxes income tax provision net income revenue overall revenue decreased in compared to due primarily to a slowdown in hospital capital spending  offset by revenue of million from cdic 
the increase in compared to was attributable to the higher mix of m turbo systems  which has a higher average selling price than the micromaxx system  and s series ultrasound tools  expansion of our international sales channels  and improved us sales productivity 
changes in exchange rates had a unfavorable impact on revenue in and had a positive impact on revenue in revenue by geographic location is as follows year ended december  percentage change versus versus united states europe  africa  and the middle east latin america and canada asia pacific total revenue 
table of contents united states us revenue decreased in compared to due primarily to decreased sales in both hospitals and office channels  partially offset by revenue of million from cdic and million of patent royalty revenue 
the increase in compared to was attributable to increased sales of new products and increased sales productivity 
international revenue from europe  africa and the middle east decreased in compared to primarily due to an unfavorable exchange rate impact of and a decreased sales in europe resulting from a slowdown in european hospital capital spending  partially offset by revenue of million from cdic 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to new products and expansion of our sales channel  partially offset by an unfavorable exchange impact of 
revenue from latin america and canada decreased in compared to due to decreased sales in latin america and an unfavorable exchange rate of  partially offset by increased sales in canada 
the increase in compared to was due to increased sales in latin america attributable to expansion of the sales channel  partially offset by an unfavorable exchange impact of 
revenue from asia pacific increased in compared to primarily due to expansion of our sales channel  increased sales of our higher end products as well as a favorable exchange rate impact of 
the increase in compared to was due to increased sales in australia attributable to new products and a favorable exchange impact of 
fiscal year outlook we expect revenue to increase up to in compared to we expect to introduce new products and features  to develop the cardiovascular disease market  and to continue international expansion 
our revenue may continue to be negatively impacted by economic factors 
the expansion of our four vertical markets including hospital  primary care  muscular skeletal  and field medicine  may not be as successful as anticipated and we may encounter regulatory and other issues in selling our products 
introduction of new products may not be as successful as anticipated 
our revenue may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products 
increased competition may also impact our anticipated revenue growth 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
gross margin years ended december  percentage of revenue gross margin gross margin remained consistent in compared to primarily as a result of an improved product mix and maintaining our pricing discipline in a difficult economy  which was offset by an unfavorable exchange impact 
gross margin remained consistent in compared to primarily as a result of the increase in warranty expense  resulting from a shift to products with five year warranties from products with one year warranties  which was offset by the reduction in royalties to atl  which had expired in september  reduction of material costs  and  favorable impact of foreign exchange rates 

table of contents fiscal year outlook we expect gross margins in to be level with increased competition from existing and new competitors as well as pricing pressure due to economic conditions could result in lower average realized prices which could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct  government and distributor sales  mix of us and international sales  and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
our cost to provide warranty services may increase if we experience an increase in failure rates or replacement costs differ from our estimates 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying value of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our cost of revenue  a decrease in our gross margin or lost sales 
our gross margin may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
operating expenses years ended december  percentage of revenue research and development sales  general  and administrative research and development expenses remained flat over compared to  as we maintained our investment in future technologies despite a challenging economy 
the increase in compared to was due to development of future new products and features  and further development related to the m turbo system and s series ultrasound tools 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to resulting primarily from decreases in legal expenses  stock based compensation and sales compensation expense  offset by cdic expenses of million  integration costs of million  and acquisition costs net of bargain purchase gain of million 
the increase in compared to was attributable to increased headcount to support business growth  increased incentive compensation related to improved financial performance  increased stock based compensation  increased legal costs related to our patent litigation  and increased severance and acquisition costs 
fiscal year outlook we anticipate that operating expenses will be up slightly in compared to other loss income  net years ended december  percentage of revenue other loss income total other loss increased in compared to due to lower gains recognized on the repurchase of our debt and a reduction in interest income  resulting from lower interest rates  offset by lower interest expense on our debt due to less outstanding debt 
in  we recorded a loss compared to other income in primarily due to a decrease in interest income  resulting from lower interest rates  higher interest expense  resulting from the first full year of outstanding convertible debt  and foreign currency losses  partially offset by the gain recognized on the partial repurchase of our convertible senior notes during the fourth quarter 

table of contents fiscal year outlook we anticipate that other loss will increase in due to lower interest income as a result of cash used in stock repurchases  slightly offset by less interest expense as a result of less outstanding debt 
income tax expense years ended december  effective tax rate income tax provision the income tax expense is based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income and the applicable foreign rates applied to foreign income 
the decrease in our consolidated effective tax rate in  as compared to  results from a reduced federal statutory rate and an increase for research and experimentation credits  offset by increases in non deductible expenses and establishing a valuation allowance on our capital loss carryforwards 
the increase in our consolidated effective tax rate in  as compared to  results primarily from non deductible expense associated with a contingent liability incurred as part of the lumenvu acquisition  a tax assessment resulting from an income tax audit in a non us jurisdiction  an increase in executive compensation subject to internal revenue code section m limitations and the impact of reaching the maximum federal marginal tax rate 
we assess our ability to realize our tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards utilized currently as well as the reversing effect of temporary differences 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
fiscal year outlook we anticipate that our effective tax rate in will be comparable to fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market accounts 
our short term investment securities totaled million as of december   compared to short term and long term investment securities million as of december  investment securities generally consist of high grade corporate debt 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
cash flows years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in and million in the decrease in compared to was primarily attributable to reduced operational performance  offset by a net decrease in working capital offset by an increase in long term deferred revenue primarily as a result of a settlement with ge 
the increase of cash provided in compared to was primarily due to improved operations and reduced spending on inventory and prepaid assets  partially offset by a reduction in payables 
investing activities used cash of million in  compared to million provided in and million used in the increase in cash used in compared to was due to the acquisition of cdic and net purchases of investment securities 
the increase in cash provided in compared to cash used in was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities of million and lower acquisition costs of million 
financing activities used cash of million in  used million in and provided million in less cash was used in financing activities in compared to primarily due to less cash used in repurchases of convertible notes  slightly offset by an increase in the repayment of long term obligations 
cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of million in repurchases of senior convertible notes and the associated warrant repurchases  partially offset by the sale of call options for million and the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
this compared to proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt of million in  offset by the purchase of the call option intended to partially hedge our convertible note for million and issuance of warrants for million  and the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million in fiscal year outlook we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures  and planned repurchase of up to million of our common shares in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash for potential future acquisitions 
our ability to provide cash from operations will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended and as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than obligations under our operating leases reflected in the contractual obligations table below 
we are not a party to any derivative transactions except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below and the call option and warrant instruments indexed to our common stock 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees require only disclosure 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 

table of contents contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations includes interest of on convertible senior notes and interest of and on bank loans assumed in the acquisition of cdic contingent purchase consideration for the acquisition of lumenvu inc the consideration is contingent upon achieving milestones related to the technology acquired from lumenvu 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  we have million of unrecognized tax benefits reflected as either liabilities or as a reduction of deferred tax assets  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be incurred 
other commitments in june  we committed to donating of our systems and two probes per system per year over a four year period to a research university commencing in for use in clinical research 
as part of our supplier agreements  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our products in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
in certain countries  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare gpos 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of million in  million in and million in critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty 
table of contents obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  business combinations  valuation of investments and inventories  warranty expense  income taxes  stock based compensation  and convertible debt 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is considered probable 
for extended warranty service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are provided or over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of any discounts  trade in allowances  and estimated returns 
we estimate returns by reviewing our historical returns  considering customer reaction to new product introductions and current economic conditions 
we separately price and sell product upgrades to our customers 
we recognize licensing revenue using the proportional performance method  a ratable recognition approach over the life of the license 
sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the distributor and collection of any resulting receivable is considered probable 
our only significant post shipment obligation to distributors is our standard product warranty covering materials and workmanship see warranty expense below 
the distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error  generally within days of receipt  and in such cases  replacement products would be sent 
since the distributor s remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit  we do not defer revenue associated with these sales 
costs associated with the repair of returned  defective products are captured in our warranty liability 
our standard distributor arrangements do not have any other return provisions 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software  software related elements  and hardware when the software elements are more than incidental to the product as a whole  is recognized in accordance with software revenue recognition rules 
we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our undelivered products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
when the undelivered element represents services under extended service contracts  revenue equal to the stated price is deferred and recognized evenly over the contract term as those services are provided 
business combination 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of cdic and medis 
the purchase method of accounting was used to account for this acquisition 
the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given  equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date 
because the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired  the excess of the value of the net assets acquired over the purchase price has been recorded as a bargain purchase gain 
we recorded identifiable assets including customer relationships  developed technology  trademarks  and internally developed software  which have lives from two to six years 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs to their net realizable values are recorded for obsolete material  shrinkage  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 

table of contents we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical product failure rates and service repair costs using management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
we provide  with certain exceptions  a five year warranty with the nanomaxx  m turbo  s series  micromaxx  and bioz systems 
given the length of the warranty period  the warranty liability for these systems is more difficult to estimate than it has been for our other products that have a one year warranty 
however  given the similarity of the components used in the nanomaxx system  m turbo system  and s series ultrasound tools compared with our micromaxx system and the historical product failure rate and service repair costs of the micromaxx and the other systems  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the warranty liability for these products 
we expect our warranty liability and expense to continue to increase due to the five year warranty offered with these products 
should actual failure rates or repair or replacement costs for any of our products differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and our results may be materially affected 
income taxes 
the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge  if any  from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate 
we have accumulated foreign nol carryforwards and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
additionally  during  with the acquisition of cdic we acquired us federal and state nol carryforwards 
we assess our ability to utilize these nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards utilized currently 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets will be fully realized with the exception of million related to capital loss carryforwards and million related to cdic state nol carryforwards 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
for stock options  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  and risk free rate 
we estimate volatility by considering our historical stock volatility 
we estimate the expected life and expected term based on historical trends 
the risk free rate is estimated using comparable published federal funds rates 
further  we estimate future forfeitures for both stock options and rsus granted  which are not expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures using historical forfeiture trends and employee turnover rates as well as our judgment of future forfeitures 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from our estimate 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock based compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on  or determined from  external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
in addition  future grants of equity awards will result in additional compensation expense in future periods 
convertible debt and hedge transaction 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance  which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion 
we bifurcated a component of the conversion option and classified that component in equity 
the value of the equity component was calculated by first measuring the fair value of the liability component  using the discount rate of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature  as of the issuance date 
the difference between the proceeds for the convertible debt and the amount reflected as the liability component was recorded as the equity component 
we recognize the accretion of the resulting discount as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
upon settlement of our convertible senior notes  we revalue the liability component  utilizing an interest rate of comparable nonconvertible debt 
we allocate a portion of the consideration transferred to the liability component equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to repurchase 
any difference between the consideration attributed to the liability component and the sum of the net carrying amount of the liability component and unamortized debt issuance costs is recognized as a gain or loss in the statement of income 
any remaining consideration is allocated to the reacquisition of the equity component and is recognized as a reduction of stockholders equity 
our interest expense is composed of two parts the stated rate of the debt and the amortization of the debt discount 
additionally  we have recorded the call option and warrant transactions as equity instruments 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no

asu removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance if the products contain both software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu becomes effective for revenue arrangements entered into for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  but requires retrospective application from the beginning of the vendor s fiscal year 
we will adopt this pronouncement prospectively beginning in and believe that this will not have a material impact on our current transactions 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  asu 
asu provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
it also requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price 
the guidance eliminates the use of the residual method  requires entities to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method and significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu becomes effective for revenue arrangements entered into for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  but requires retrospective application from the beginning of the vendor s fiscal year 
we will adopt this pronouncement prospectively beginning in and believe that this will not have a material impact on our current transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our investments consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities or expected maturities of less than one year 
generally we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity  however  we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk because of our international presence  we are exposed to foreign currency risk on intercompany balances  from translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results and in receivables due from customers denominated in a currency other than usd 
our transactional and translational exposure is primarily related to the strengthening of the usd against the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and customers 
as of december   our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than usd were million 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts that expire on january  they serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the usd 
these foreign currencies include the british pound  the canadian dollar  the euro and the japanese yen 
gains and losses in the fair value of these contracts are intended to offset the losses and gains  resulting from the changes in the underlying intercompany balances 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was not material to our results of operations or our financial position 
the operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated from their local currency into usd 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound  the european union euro and the japanese yen represented the majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations 
as of december   we had million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts expiring at various dates through december  the fair value of these contracts as of december  was not material to our results of operations or our financial position 

table of contents our foreign currency forward contracts are not eligible for hedge accounting treatment and changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in other income on the consolidated statement of income 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of these contracts  totaling million in notional amount  indicates that if the usd weakened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by approximately million 
conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would increase by approximately million 
the offsetting gains and losses resulting from the changes in the intercompany balances as described above are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above 
we transact sales with international customers primarily in usd 
we are exposed to risk of fluctuations in their local currency  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by them 
as of december  of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or million  was denominated in a currency other than usds 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are considered necessary in order to mitigate our collection risk
