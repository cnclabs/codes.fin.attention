item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year 
fiscal contained weeks while fiscal and both contained weeks 
this extra week  which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal  impacts the year over year analysis in this md a 
there are references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the company s results of operations 
results for the full fiscal year were not significantly impacted by the movement of foreign currency exchanges rates as  for example  the us dollar weakened against the euro by approximately during fiscal fluctuations during the quarters of fiscal had a more pronounced impact on the company s comparative results as described in the company s form q s filed with the sec 
when comparing fiscal with  the exchange rates between the us dollar and many foreign currencies  especially the euro  fluctuated significantly 
for example  the us dollar strengthened against the euro by approximately when comparing fiscal with fiscal when the stronger us dollar exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is a decrease in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
when the us dollar weakens  the resulting impact is an increase in us dollars of reported results as compared with the prior period 
in the discussion that follows  this is referred to as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information  such as income or expense items as adjusted for the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as discussed above 
sales adjusted for the impact of acquisitions by adjusting avnet s prior periods to include the sales generated by businesses acquired as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the period presented and  in the discussion that follows  the sales adjusted for acquisitions is referred to as pro forma sales or organic sales

table of contents management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods 
furthermore  management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these items and uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
results of operations executive summary fiscal financial results exceeded management s expectations as the technology markets continued to recover from the recession  which began in fiscal and continued into the first quarter of fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  the company experienced double digit year over year revenue growth in each quarter and ended the fiscal year with record revenue of billion  an increase in revenue of over fiscal both operating groups contributed to the significant growth as organic revenue increased over year over year 
in addition  due to the company s week fiscal calendar  fiscal included an extra week when compared with fiscal  which management estimates added approximately million in sales 
although gross profit margin has continued to improve sequentially in the last three quarters of fiscal  it still declined basis points year over year to 
the year over year decline was partially due to business mix and the negative economic environment as all three regions in both operating groups experienced declines  in particular in em emea and ts asia 
operating income increased significantly over the prior year to million 
the company reported an operating loss of over billion in fiscal  as a result of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the company also recognized restructuring  integration and other charges in both fiscal and excluding the impairment and restructuring  integration and other charges  operating income margin increased basis points year over year 
the improvement in operating income margin was primarily the result of effective cost management  including the impact of cost reduction actions taken during fiscal for which the full benefit was realized during fiscal  as sales increased year over year as compared with only a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
management continues to focus on managing working capital velocity  defined as annual sales or quarterly sales annualized when calculating the velocity for a quarter divided by the sum of the monthly average of receivables plus inventory less accounts payable 
this focus resulted in working capital velocity improving to a record times in fiscal as a result  the company used only million in cash from operations in fiscal to fund the growth in revenue 
subsequent to fiscal  the company completed its previously announced acquisition of bell microproducts inc bell  a value added distributor of storage and computing technology providing integration and support services to oems  vars  system builders and end users in the us  canada  emea and latin america 
bell operated both a distribution and single tier reseller business and generated sales of approximately billion in calendar  of which  and was generated in north america  emea and latin america  respectively 
the consideration for the transaction consisted of in cash per share of bell common stock  which represented an equity value of approximately million  including the accelerated vesting of  and payment in cash for  bell equity awards of approximately million which will be expensed in the first quarter of fiscal  and the assumption of approximately million in net debt  thereby resulting in an aggregate transaction value of approximately million 
the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to future earnings excluding integration and transaction costs 
the company is integrating bell into both the em and ts operating groups and expects cost saving synergies of approximately million to million upon completion of the integration activities  which are anticipated to be completed by the end of fiscal also subsequent to fiscal year  the company completed it acquisition of tallard  a value added distributor of it solutions in latin america with annualized revenues of approximately million  and also completed a tender offer for unidux  an electronics component distributor in japan with annualized revenues of approximately million

the negative effects of the recession began later in the emea region than in the americas and  as a result  the region s recovery also occurred later than the other regions 
however  the quarterly gross profit margin at em improved sequentially during the last three quarters of fiscal in all three regions with the largest improvement in the emea region where gross profit margin increased over basis points from the march to june quarter

the cost reduction actions taken during fiscal  as described in further detail below  were completed during the first quarter of fiscal and the full benefit of the actions were realized beginning in the second quarter of fiscal metrics that management monitors with respect to operating expenses are sg a expenses as a percentage of sales and as a percentage of gross profit 
sg a expenses were of sales and of gross profit in fiscal as compared with of sales and of gross profit in fiscal the year over year improvement in these metrics is primarily the result of effective cost management  including the impact of cost reduction actions taken during fiscal  as sales increased year over year as compared with only a increase in sg a expenses

in the third quarter of fiscal  the company began to experience demand weakness and organic sales growth at both em and ts continued to slow through the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company experienced continued sales deceleration in both operating groups  particularly in november in the asia region and in december in the americas region 
during the third quarter of fiscal  end demand in the em business deteriorated even further  in particular in em americas and em emea which have been the company s most profitable regions 
as a result of the poor market conditions through mid march of fiscal  the company took actions to reduce costs by approximately million on an annualized basis and expected such actions to be completed by the end of the june quarter of fiscal however  based upon third quarter of fiscal results  the company announced further actions to reduce annualized costs by an additional million  bringing the aggregate annual cost reductions announced to approximately million since march as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  management estimated that approximately million in annualized cost savings had been achieved and the remaining cost reduction actions were completed at the end of september  therefore  the full benefit of the cost savings of million were reflected in the december quarter of fiscal in addition  the december quarter of included cost synergies of approximately million as a result of acquisition integration activities most of which were completed by the end of fiscal impairment charges during fiscal  the company recognized non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling billion pre tax  billion after tax and per share

as a result  the goodwill from the recent acquisition was required to be impaired

avnet s effective tax rate on its loss before income taxes was in fiscal as compared with an effective rate on income of in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was negatively impacted by the non deductibility of substantially all of the impairment charges and changes to existing tax positions 
partially offsetting these impacts was a net tax benefit of million  or per share  related primarily to the release of tax reserves due to the settlement of certain tax audits in europe 
avnet s effective tax rate is primarily a function of the tax rates in the numerous jurisdictions in which it does business applied to the mix of pre tax book income 
the effective tax rate may vary year over year as a result of changes in tax requirements in the jurisdictions in which the company does business and management s evaluation of its ability to generate sufficient taxable income to offset net operating loss carryforwards as well as the establishment of reserves for unfavorable outcomes of tax positions taken on certain matters that are common to multinational enterprises and the actual outcome of those matters

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charges to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets wherein such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
in determining the company s effective tax rate  management considers current tax regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which it operates  and requires management s judgment for interpretation and application 
changes to such tax regulations or disagreements with the company s interpretation or application by tax authorities in any of the company s major jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s provision for income taxes 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
the company is also required to make judgments regarding the evaluation of changes in events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  the results of which would determine whether an interim impairment test must be performed 
should these assumptions or judgments change in the future based upon market conditions or should the structure of the company s reporting units change based upon changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges to its remaining goodwill 
during fiscal  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined there is no goodwill impairment and there are no reporting units with material goodwill that are at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test

see impairment charges in this md a for further discussion of the company s evaluation of goodwill impairment in fiscal contingencies and litigation from time to time  the company may become liable with respect to pending and threatened litigation  tax  environmental and other matters 
management does not anticipate that any contingent matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
revenue recognition the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized in income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements  from time to time  which are intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 

table of contents the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding at july  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt excludes discounts on long term notes 
the following table sets forth the carrying value and fair value of the company s debt at july  dollars in millions carrying value at fair value at carrying value at fair value at july  july  june  june  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate excludes discounts and premiums on long term notes 
many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at july  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
