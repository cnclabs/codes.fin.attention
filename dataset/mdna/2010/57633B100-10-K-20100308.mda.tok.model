item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a domestic provider of it staffing services to mostly large and medium sized organizations 
since july until our september  spin off  we conducted our business as subsidiaries of igate 
we do not sell  lease or otherwise market any computer software or hardware  and of our revenues are derived from the sale of information technology and brokerage operations staffing services 
it should be noted that in january  the company sold its brokerage operations staffing business  as more fully discussed in note  subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
economic trends and outlook generally  our business outlook is highly correlated to general us economic conditions 
during periods of increasing employment and economic expansion  demand for our services tends to increase 
conversely  during periods of contracting employment and or a slowing domestic economy  demand for our services tends to decline 
as the economy slowed during the last half of and recessionary conditions emerged in and during much of  we have seen less demand for it staffing services 
during the second half of  we have seen signs of market stabilization and a modest pick up in activity levels within certain sales channels and technologies 
these are encouraging signs as we enter  however  the weak us job market and high unemployment are still troubling data points for our industry 
in addition to tracking general us economic conditions  a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients see the risk factor entitled our revenues are highly concentrated  and the loss of a significant client would adversely affect our business and revenues 
accordingly  our trends and outlook are impacted by the prospects and well being of these specific clients 
by way of illustration  during the second half of  while general us economic conditions were positive  we experienced a decline in billable headcount and negative sequential quarterly revenue growth due to client specific issues at two of our larger clients 
this account concentration factor may result in our results of operations deviating from the prevailing us economic trends from time to time 
in recent years  a larger portion of our revenues have come from our wholesale sales channel  which consists largely of strategic relationships with systems integrators and other staffing organizations 
this channel tends to carry lower gross margins  but provides higher volume opportunities 
should this trend in our business mix continue  it is likely that our overall gross margins will decline 
within our retail sales channel  many larger users of it staffing services are employing managed service providers msp to manage their contractor spending in an effort to drive down overall costs 
the impact of this shift towards the msp model has been lower gross margins 
should this trend towards utilizing the msp model continue  it is likely that our gross margins will decline in the future

in order to minimize the impact of the economic and industry trends mentioned above on our gross margin  the company will need to continue lowering operating cost structure as a percentage of totals revenues  through innovation and greater efficiencies 
investments in our global recruitment centers  offshore telesales group  and technological improvements  coupled with continued cost rationalization efforts  should provide us with a cost effective platform in which to deliver our services

the march completion of a major brokerage operations assignment  coupled with very limited new order opportunities during the year  resulted in our brokerage operations billable headcount declining from consultants at year end 
table of contents to consultants at year end in light of this significant decline  coupled with brokerage operations not considered a core service offering  the company sold the business to the former vice president of brokerage operations in january for contingent consideration 
our it billable consultant headcount at december  total consultants  which was approximately lower than the it billable headcount of consultants at december  much of this billable headcount decline occurred during the fourth quarter a loss of consultants and reflected a high level of project ends 
activity levels increased modestly over the second half of which is an encouraging sign as we enter it should be noted that much of the billable headcount declines during the fourth quarter did not fully impact our revenues for that period as much of the decline occurred during the latter part of the quarter 
accordingly  the full impact of this headcount decline will be reflected in our first quarter results 
revenues from our wholesale it channel in declined by from a year ago  largely due to steep declines from many of our staffing clients 
revenues from our integrator clients declined modestly during the year  and actually showed some growth during the last half of the year 
retail it channel revenues declined by during  compared to much of this decrease was with our financial services clients and with a major msp account 
additionally  pricing pressures contributed to the revenue declines in brokerage operations revenues were down from and reflected the completion of a major assignment in march and very soft demand for brokerage operation services for much of the year 
permanent placement fee revenues were approximately  lower in compared to and was largely due to a deteriorating job market in the us for much of ibm and tek systems represented and of total revenues  respectively

our top ten clients represented approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to in compared to in our gross margin performance reflects a number of offsetting factors 
industry wide pricing pressures continued to persist  particularly during the first half of however  we were able to mitigate much of the impact through company initiatives to rationalize and adjust resource costs in response to prevailing economic conditions 
additionally  lower fee revenues had a negative impact on gross margins  when compared to the previous year 
this was largely off set by a favorable channel mix of business  as less revenues in came from our lower margin brokerage operations unit 
wholesale it channel gross margin increased by basis points in compared to this improvement was due to a favorable revenue mix between lower margin staffing clients and integrator clients 
in our retail it channel  gross margins declined by basis points due to pricing pressures from msp clients  net of resource cost reductions 
brokerage operations margins were down basis points in to 
lack of demand for brokerage operation services resulted in lower pricing on the limited amount of new order opportunities 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expense in totaled million  or of revenues  compared to million or of revenues in in  we continued austerity measures to align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions 
these measures included the continuation of an employee salary and wage freeze  the elimination of bonuses  and adjustments to our employee benefit programs 
in addition to these austerity measures  benefited from lower cost components that are variable in nature and tend to track activity and profitability levels  such as sales and recruiting commissions  h b processing fees and job board access fees 
these expense components tend to decrease in challenging times and increase as business conditions turn favorable and activity levels increase 

table of contents below is a variance analysis by expense category related to the million decline in sg a expenses in compared to sales expense decreased by million due a reduction in sales support staff  lower management bonuses  and reduced marketing expenditures

general and administrative expense was million lower in lower management bonuses  facility costs  bad debt expense  and insurance premiums were partially offset by higher severance costs in versus it is important to note that the company invested in additional sales and recruiting resources during the fourth quarter as signs of market stabilization emerged 
additional investment is planned for early should the us economy continue towards economic recovery and job growth

it should be noted that much of the billable consultant decline in fourth quarter did not fully impact our revenues during that period as most of the decline occurred during the latter part of the quarter 
revenues from our wholesale it channel for declined by from the corresponding period  one year earlier 
declines from several systems integrator clients were largely responsible for this year over year variance 
the wholesale channel tends to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions as clients in this channel quickly adjust their ratio of sub vendor consultants employed in response to changing conditions

as industry demand weakened  pricing pressures steadily increased over the course of the year 
in addition  an increasing portion of our overall revenues in was generated by our lower margin brokerage operations business 
we entered with a gross margin run rate of approximately and expected continued pressure on our gross margins until such time as the us economy began to stabilize 
wholesale it channel gross margin declined by basis points in compared to pricing pressures on new assignments during were particularly pronounced with many of our it staffing clients  as these clients looked aggressively to mitigate their own margin deterioration by reducing sub vendor costs 
in our retail it channel  gross margins declined by basis points in compared to much of this decline was attributable to msp clients who aggressively sought bill rate reductions on existing assignments 
gross margins on our brokerage operations revenues were essentially flat in from the previous year

austerity measures  enacted during the latter part of  included adjustments to our employee benefits programs  and an employee salary and wage freeze  in addition to continued rationalization of support staff 
in addition to these austerity initiatives  it should be noted that there are significant components of our operating cost structure that are variable in nature and tend to track our activity and profitability levels

bad debt expense was approximately million higher in  offset by lower management bonus expense and higher legal expenses in the year  related to a lawsuit settlement 

table of contents fourth quarter was our first quarter in which our operating cost structure reflected all expenses of a publicly traded  stand alone organization 
prior to the distribution  our operating cost structure included expense allocations charged by our former parent related to certain corporate overhead expenses  but excluding many expense components that would have been incurred had we been an independent organization 
during the first nine months of these expense allocations totaled million 
it should be noted that the incremental costs incurred in fourth quarter associated with operating as a publicly traded  stand along organization  approximated the quarterly allocations that we were charged by our former parent during prior to the distribution 
other income expense components in and  interest income generated on excess cash balances approximated million 
in  we incurred expenses totaling million related to a loss in an unconsolidated affiliate and foreign exchange transaction losses 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million  representing an effective tax rate on pre tax income of  compared to million for  which represented an effective tax rate on pre tax income of 
as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  we have historically derived certain tax benefits as a result of being included in the igate consolidated us tax return 
during and  these benefits totaled million and million  respectively 
excluding these benefits  which would not be available to us as a stand alone company  our effective tax rate would have been for and for a higher aggregate state income tax rate and certain nondeductible compensation costs incurred in accounted for the higher adjusted effective tax rate during that year 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition and liquidity at december   we had million of cash and equivalents  no outstanding debt  and a tangible net worth of million 
this compares to million of cash and equivalents  no outstanding debt  and a tangible net worth of million at december  in addition to our cash balances  we have access to a revolving credit facility with million of maximum availability under which our borrowing base was million as of december  this facility is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein 
historically  we have funded our business needs with cash generated from operating activities 
prior to the distribution  we would typically transfer our excess cash balances to our former parent 
in the staffing services industry  investment in operating working capital defined as current assets minus cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities is a significant use of cash 
controlling our operating working capital levels by closely managing our accounts receivable balance is an important element of cash generation 
at december  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso s measurement was days compared  to days and days at december  and  respectively 
we believe that effectively managing our dso s has been an important factor in maximizing cash flows in recent years 
cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalents balances on hand at december  are expected to be adequate to fund our business needs over the next months  exclusive of any acquisition activities 
below is a tabular presentation of cash flow activities for the periods discussed years ended december  cash flows activities amounts in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents operating activities cash provided from operating activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
factors contributing to cash flows during the period included net income of million  non cash charges of million principally related to stock based compensation  depreciation and bad debt charges and a decrease in operating working capital of million 
the decline in operating working capital was due to lower activity levels experienced in  partially offset by an increase in our dso measurement 
in  cash flows from operating activities included net income of million  non cash charges of million  and a decline in operating working capital requirements of million 
the operating working capital decline was the result of lower activity levels and a day improvement in our dso measurement 
factors contributing to cash flows were net income of million  non cash charges of million  and a modest decline in operating working capital 
the operating working capital decline included a million increase related to the settlement of a lawsuit which was reserved for in  partially offset by reduction in accounts receivable  largely due to dso improvements 
we expect to see operating working capital levels increase should activity levels improve in such an increase would have a negative impact on cash generated from operating activities 
we believe that dso s are likely to remain in the day range in investing activities cash used in investing activities for december   and totaled approximately million for each of the three years 
in  maintenance type capital expenditures accounted for essentially all of our cash usages 
in and  recurring maintenance type capital expenditures and investments in a joint venture accounted for our uses of cash 
we believe that recurring maintenance type capital expenditures should continue to require approximately million in annual investment to support our existing operations 
financing activities prior to the distribution  our financial resources had historically been managed by igate on a centralized basis 
our cash balances were transferred to igate regularly  and igate funded our cash as needed 
in  prior to the distribution  and during the year ended december   mastech had net cash transfers to igate of million and million  respectively 
in  financing activity generated million of cash flow due to excess tax benefits from share based payments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options by our employees 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we have financial commitments related to existing operating leases  primarily for office space that we occupy 
our commitments are as follows payments due by period amounts in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total operating leases we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and whenever possible  seeking to insure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation 

table of contents seasonality our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations 
however  our consultants billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation policies 
accordingly  we typically have lower utilization rates and higher benefit costs during the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and require the application of significant judgment by management  and as a result  are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observances of industry trends and other available information from outside sources  as appropriate 
the following explains our most critical accounting policies 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein  for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
time and materials contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
out of pocket expense reimbursement amounts vary from assignment to assignment 
in  these reimbursement amounts represented approximately of total revenues 
revenue is earned when our consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
in certain situations related to client direct hire transactions  where our fee is contingent upon the hire s continued employment with the client  revenue recognition is deferred until such employment requirements are satisfied 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts we extend credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
the majority of our revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from large companies and major systems integrators 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed and  in accordance with the terms of client contracts  will be invoiced in subsequent periods 
we review accounts receivable periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts when it is probable that the related receivable balance will not be collected 
this analysis is based on historical collection experience  client specific collection issues  and other matters that we identify in our collection monitoring 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be necessary  which could impact earnings 
stock based compensation effective january   we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards using a fair value approach as prescribed in asc topic formerly sfas no 
r share based payments 
the impact of this adoption is more fully described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein 
income taxes prior to our spin off  we have filed our federal tax return as part of igate s consolidated us tax return 
as previously noted  we received certain tax benefits from being included in igate s tax return  which we will not enjoy as a stand alone company 
the impact on our income tax expense related to such benefits is discussed above and disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere herein 

table of contents we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years  we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or decrease to income tax expense 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 generally accepted accounting principles asc topic which establishes the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc as the official single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles 
all existing accounting standards are superseded 
all other accounting guidance not included in the codification will be considered non authoritative 
the codification also includes all relevant securities and exchange commission guidance organized using the same topical structure in separate sections within the codification 
following the codification  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates asu which will serve to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the changes to the codification 
the codification is not intended to change gaap  but it will change the way gaap is organized and presented 
the codification is effective for the company s third quarter financial statements and the principal impact on the financial statements is limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting literature will be referenced in accordance with the codification 
in august  the fasb issued guidance on measuring liabilities at fair value 
this guidance applies to all entities that measure liabilities at fair value and provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  an entity is required to measure fair value using one or more techniques laid out in this asu 
the guidance provided in this asu is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
the company does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance for revenue recognition on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the asu provides amendments to the criteria in revenue recognition multiple element arrangements for separating consideration in multiple element arrangements 
the amendments in this asu establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
further  the term fair value in the revenue guidance will be replaced with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a market place participant 
the amendments in this asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
cash equivalents are stated at cost  which approximates market value 
our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variations 
foreign currency risk exists by nature of our global recruitment centers 
however  exposure to currency risk is not viewed to be material and  accordingly  we do not have any exchange rate hedges in place
