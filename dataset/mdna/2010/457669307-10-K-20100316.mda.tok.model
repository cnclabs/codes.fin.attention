item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with expertise in recombinant protein drug development 
our corporate office is located in richmond  virginia 
on march   we completed the sale of our fob platform to merck co  inc merck for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as part of this transaction  merck assumed the lease of our boulder  colorado based manufacturing facility which was also used to manufacture iplex and acquired ownership of all the equipment in the building 
in addition  merck offered positions to employees at the boulder facility 
we retained our richmond  virginia corporate office  which houses our clinical  regulatory  finance and administrative functions  in support of our iplex program 
after fees  taxes and other expenses related to the transaction  we received total net proceeds of approximately million 
we retained our richmond  va corporate office  which house s our clinical  regulatory  finance  and administrative functions  in support of the continuing iplex program 
until the sale of our follow on biologics platform  we pursued a dual path strategy involving entry into the follow on biologics arena also known as biosimilars  biogenerics and biologics and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
following the sale of our follow on biologics assets  we have engaged the services of rbc capital markets to act as financial advisor in evaluating other options for use of these proceeds from sale of our fob business to merck 
these options could include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  product licensing or mergers  and could also include share repurchase or the distribution of a portion of the proceeds to shareholders if we do not find attractive acquisition or licensing opportunities 
in parallel we also intend to continue to focu s on our proprietary protein platform and our product  the fda approved iplex  which is in various stages of development for a number of serious medical conditions 
based on a comprehensive market analysis  our current resource allocation strategy for iplex is focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  also known as lou gehrig s disease and retinopathy of prematurity rop 
in april  we engaged rbc capital markets rbc as our financial advisor to assist us in evaluating strategic options the strategic review process for use of the fob sales proceeds 
these options could include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  product licensing or mergers  and could also include share repurchases or the distribution to shareholders of all or part of the remaining fob sales proceeds if we do not find attractive acquisition  licensing or merger opportunities 
on june  we announced that geoffrey allan  phd  resigned as our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board due to a health condition 
dr 
allan had held these positions since our company was formed in mel sharoky  md  one of our directors  assumed the role of chairman of the board 
pending the completion of the strategic review process  we have decided not to hire a new president and chief executive officer 
in june  we announced results from our exploratory us phase ii clinical trial evaluating iplextm in patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy mmd 
the trial explored measures of endurance  muscle function and strength  cognitive function  gastrointestinal function  general health  pain  quality of life  insulin sensitivity  lipid metabolism  and safety and tolerability of iplextm 
the results of the trial indicated that iplextm did not exhibit a statistically significant improvement in the functional measure of endurance by the six minute walk test  muscle function  streng th  cognitive function  general health  pain  or quality of life in any of the tests utilized in this study 
iplextm did  however  demonstrate improvements in standard measures of insulin sensitivity and reductions in fasting glucose  fasting insulin  cholesterol and triglycerides  which is consistent with the expected metabolic profile of insulin like growth factor 
pending the completion of the strategic review process  we have decided not to conduct further clinical trials focused on mmd patients 
following the transfer of our boulder  colorado manufacturing facility to merck  we no longer have the capability to manufacture iplex  which is an extremely complicated drug to produce 
any agreement with a third party to undertake the manufacture of iplex would not result in production of additional quantities of iplex for at least to months 
we are not actively exploring any third party manufacturing arrangements for iplex at this time 
since we no longer have a facility to manufacture iplex  we announced in july that we would conserve our limited inventory of iplex on hand for the treatment of existing patients  would cease the supply of iplex to any new patients  and would not initiate further clinical trials with iplex including a phase ii clinical trial for als patients in the us discussed with the us food and drug administration fda in early 
we plan  however  to continue to collect and analyze data for the rop and als indications 
there are approximately patients who currently receive iplex  in the us and the remainder around the rest of the world 
most of the patients receive iplex pursuant to a court ordered expanded access program eap for als in italy  pursuant to which we have received most of our operating revenues in the form of cost recovery charges 
the us patients are being treated for als under single patient investigational new drug applications approved by the us food and drug administration fda 
we believe that we have sufficient iplex inventory to supply these existing patients into approximately mid at which time our primary source of operating revenues will cease 
until the extraordinary gain generated by the sale of our fob platform to merck  we have not been profitable 
we have accumulated deficits of approximately million through december  when our iplex product inventory is depleted  our primary source of income will be interest earned on the fob sales proceeds  unless an income generating activity results from our strategic review process 
until the recent sale of our manufacturing facility to merck  we had not been profitable and have accumulated deficits of approximately million through december  following the sale of our fob assets to merck  we operated on a cash neutral basis as a result of revenues on our expanded access program and interest on the net proceeds of the sale of our fob assets  offsetting our ongoing base costs 
moving forward our major source of income will continue to be the cost recovery charges for our expanded access program and our major expenses will be related to due diligence for the ongoing corporate strategic review together with some research and development expenses 
in general  our expenditures may increase as development of our product can didate s progresses 
however  there will be fluctuations from period to period caused by differences in project costs incurred at each stage of development 
research and development activities since we began operations in late  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of a number of product candidates for metabolic and endocrine diseases 
until the sale of our fob platform on march   our research and development efforts were principally focused on pursuing a dual path strategy involving entry into the fob arena and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
our focus is now principally on our proprietary protein platform 
our lead proprietary protein product  the fda approved iplex  has been studied as a treatment for several serious medical conditions including als and rop 
we conduct very little of our own preclinical laboratory research 
we have outsourced several pha se ii clinical studies with iplex and our other anti cancer product candidates  insm and rhigfbp  and have no plans to conduct additional clinical studies at this time 
all of our research and development expenditures  whether conducted by our own staff or by external scientists on our behalf and at our expense  are recorded as expenses as incurred and were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to develop and manufacture products and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
all of our research and development expenditures related to our proprietary protein platform are interrelated as they are all associated with drugs that modulate igf i activity in the human body 
a significant finding in any one drug for a particular indication may provide benefits to our efforts across all of these products 
all of these products also share a substantial amount of our common fixed costs such as salaries  facility costs  utilities and maintenance 
given the small portion of research and development expenses that are related to products other than iplex we have determined that very limited benefits would be obtained from implementing cost tracking systems that would be necessary to allow for cost information on a product by product basis 
at present we expect research of iplex in the als indication to represent our main research and development effort for  although we currently do not expect research and development expenses in this area to be material 
this may change  however if  following the strategic review process  we identify an opportunity which changes the focus of the company our clinical trials with our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control  including the possibility that necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained 
for example  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that is determined to be appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may also be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  all of our product candidates and particularly those that are in the preclinical or early clinical trial stage must overcome significant regulatory  technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
some of these product candidates may never reach the clinical trial stage of research and development 
as preclinical studies and clinical trials progress  we may determine that collaborative relationships will be necessary to help us further develop or to commercialize our product candidates  but such relationships may be difficult or impossible to arrange 
our projects or intended projects may also be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
any significant delays that occur or additional expenses that we incur may have a material adverse affect on our financial position and may require us to raise additional capital sooner or in larger amounts than is presently expected 
in addition  as a result of the risks and uncertainties related to the development and approval of our product candidates and the additional uncertainties related to our ability to market and sell these products once approved for commercial sale  we are unable to provide a meaningful prediction regarding the period in which material net cash inflows from any of these projects is expected to become available 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal for the months ended december   revenues totaled million  as compared to million in the months of consistent with fourth quarter results  the decrease was primarily attributable to a year over year decrease of million in cost recovery from our iplex eap in europe 
net income for the months ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the corresponding months of this million improvement was primarily due to the million after tax gain on sale of our fob assets to merck  combined with a million decrease in total expenses  a million improvement in investment returns  a million decrease in interest expense  and a million reduction in the realized loss on investments  which were partially offset by a million reduction in net revenue 
the million decrease in total expenses was due to an million reduction in r d expenses  which was partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
the million reduction in r d expenses was due primarily to a decrease in manufacturing expenses following the sale of our fob assets in march the million increase in sg a expenses was due largely to a combination of the recognition of stock compensation expense for the restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested on march   and the award of bonuses  together with the increased finance  legal and consulting fees related to the ongoing strategic review 
the improved return on investments reflected the increased cash position  the lower interest expense was again due to the reduction in debt discount amortization and the million reduction in investment loss was due to the write off of the napo investment  which occurred in as of december   insmed had total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and certificate of deposits on hand totaling million  consisting of million in cash and short term investments and million in a certificate of deposit  as compared to million of cash on hand as of december  the million increase in total cash was due to the million in before tax proceeds from the sale of insmed s fob assets to merck  million from the conversion of warrants and options into common stock  the release of a million previously restricted certificate of deposit  and a million increase in unrealized gains on investments  which was partially offset by million utilized to fund operations and million for the partial repayment of the company s convertible n otes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the full year totaled million  up from million in the corresponding period of this increase was primarily due to a million improvement in cost recovery from the eap to treat patients with als in italy 
the net loss for the months ended december  was million or per share  compared to million or per share for the months ended december  r d expenses increased to million from million  reflecting the higher activity as our clinical trials in the fob and iplex areas advanced 
sg a expenses fell to million from million  due to the elimination of litigation expenses following the march settlement and the removal of commercial expenses associated with our business restructuring plan 
interest income for the full year was million  compared to million for the full year this decrease was mainly due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance for the full year as compared to the full year interest expense for the months ended december  was million  compared to  for the corresponding period of this higher interest expense was due to an increase in the debt discount amortization resulting from the quarterly payment of our convertible notes  which began in march as of december   we had total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand of million  compared to million on hand as of december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments mainly reflected the use of million for operating activities and million for principal and interest repayments of our convertible notes  which began on march  liquidity and capital resources there is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point where fda approval for sales is received 
in our financial management  we have generally sought to raise the funds necessary for such development primarily through the issuance of equity securities in private placement transactions 
however  we may pursue additional financing options  including entering into agreements with collaborative partners in order to provide milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
we have funded our operations to date through public and private placements of debt and equity securities and the proceeds from the sale of our fob platform to merck 
we will continue to incur losses to the extent we expand our research and development and do not expect material revenues for at least the next several years furthermore  revenues from our eap in italy associated with cost recovery will be eliminated by approximately mid  when our current iplextm inventory is depleted 
at december   our cash and investments were approximately million  and were invested in money market instruments  treasuries  municipal bonds and mutu al funds 
this is an increase of million from fiscal  as a result of our sale of our fob platform to merck and our cash use during the year 
expenditures in fiscal were principally related to research and development  clinical trial activity  manufacturing activity and administrative activity at our sites in boulder  colorado  and richmond  virginia and due diligence expenses related to our ongoing strategic review process 
planned expenditures in include continued strategic review process due diligence expenses  the funding of our ongoing research and development activity  and general and administrative support costs 
on march   we completed the sale of our fob platform for an aggregate purchase price of million 
after fees  taxes and other costs related to the transaction  we received net proceeds of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
we believe these net proceeds will provide sufficient liquidity for us to continue as a going concern 
even though we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for the upcoming year  our business strategy may require us additional capital through debt or equity sales 
in the future  we may require additional funds for the continued development of our potential product candidates or to pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when we need them or on favorable terms 
if at any time we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds  we will be required to delay  restrict or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
we could  but have no plans to  enter into agreement with corporate partners in order to fund operations through milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts as set forth below payments due by years in thousands total beyond operating lease obligations short term debt short term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of the company s convertible notes outstanding as of december  we began repaying these notes in quarterly installments  beginning on march  we made our final payment on the notes on march  critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policies discussed below are those we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financ ial statements description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  cost to develop and manufacture products  patent protection costs and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
we do not have separate accounting policies for internal or external research and development and we do not conduct any research and development for others 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be com pleted at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
revenue recognition we record revenue from product sales when the goods are delivered and title passes to the customer 
at the time of sale  estimates for sales deductions  including rebates to government agencies  are recorded 
these provisions are provided for in the same period the related product sales are recorded 
following our settlement agreement with tercica and genentech on march   we ceased to supply iplex to patients and discontinued sales of iplex for short stature disorders as of march  revenue from our expanded access program in italy is recognized when the drugs have been provided to program patients and collectibility is assured 
royalties that were paid to tercica and genentech are netted against expanded access program revenue 
license income is recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and payments are due 
grant revenue is recognized once payment has been received 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
currently  we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this option valuation model 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fai r valued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities and  at december   had million invested in money market instruments  treasuries  municipal bonds and mutual funds 
such investments are subject to interest rate and credit risk and are not insured by the federal government 
our policy of investing in highly rated securities whose liquidities at december   are all less than two years minimizes such risks 
in addition  while a hypothetical one percent per annum decrease in market interest rates would have reduced our interest income for fiscal  it would not have resulted in a loss of the principal and the decline in interest income would have been immaterial 
our purpose in making these investments is to generate investment income 
we currently do not transact any significant portion of our business in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that we continue to transact our business using the us dollar as our functional currency  we do not believe that the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
