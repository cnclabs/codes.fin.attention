our former goodrich aviation technical services  inc 
ats business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial and general aviation airplane markets 
we are also a leading supplier of systems and products to the global defense and space markets 
our business is conducted globally with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
key market channels for products and services  growth drivers and industry and our highlights we participate in three key market channels commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane original equipment oe  commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket  and defense and space 
commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane oe includes sales of products and services for new airplanes produced by airbus and boeing  and regional  business and small airplane manufacturers 
the key growth drivers in this market channel include the number of orders for their airplanes  which will be delivered to the manufacturers customers over a period of several years  oe manufacturer production and delivery rates for in service airplanes such as the airbus a and boeing ng  and introductions of new airplane models such as the boeing and  and the airbus a xwb  and engine types such as the pratt and whitney purepower tm pwg 
we continue to expect deliveries to commence during the fourth quarter of we have significant sales content on most of the airplanes manufactured in this market channel 
over the last few years  we have benefited from increased production rates and deliveries of airbus and boeing airplanes and from our substantial content on many of the regional and general aviation airplanes 
delivery of new commercial  regional  business  and general aviation aircraft in and beyond  however  may be negatively impacted by the current economic conditions which may influence customers willingness and or ability to purchase new aircraft 
commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket the commercial  regional  business and general aviation airplane aftermarket channel includes sales of products and services for existing commercial and general aviation airplanes  primarily to airlines and package carriers around the world 
the key growth drivers in this channel include worldwide passenger capacity growth measured by available seat miles asm and the size  type and utilization levels of the worldwide airplane 
table of contents fleet 
other important factors affecting growth in this market channel are the age and types of the airplanes in the fleet  fuel prices  airline maintenance practices  gross domestic product gdp trends in countries and regions around the world and domestic and international air freight activity 
capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asms  is expected to grow slightly in asm expectations could be adversely affected if airlines choose to fly their in service airplanes less frequently  or temporarily ground airplanes due to decreased demand  high fuel prices and other factors including the downturn of the global economy 
while we have significant product content on most of the airplane models that are currently in service  we enjoy the benefit of having excellent positions on the newer  more fuel efficient airplanes currently in service 
even though many airlines have announced that they will remove some of their older airplanes  such as boeing md and classic airplanes  from their fleets  we do not expect these removals to have a significant impact on our results in defense and space worldwide defense and space sales include sales to prime contractors such as boeing  northrop grumman  lockheed martin  the us government and foreign companies and governments 
the key growth drivers in this channel include the level of defense spending by the us and foreign governments  the number of new platform starts  the level of military flight operations  the level of upgrade  overhaul and maintenance activities associated with existing platforms and demand for optical surveillance and reconnaissance systems 
the market for our defense and space products is global  and is not dependent on any single program  platform or customer 
we anticipate fewer new fighter and transport aircraft platform starts over the next several years 
we also anticipate that the introduction of the f lightning ii and new helicopter platforms  along with upgrades on existing defense and space platforms  will provide long term growth opportunities in this market channel 
additionally  we are participating in  and developing new products for  the rapidly expanding homeland security and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance sectors  which should further strengthen our position in this market channel 
long term sustainable growth we believe that we are well positioned to grow our sales  through organic growth and acquisitions  over the long term due to awards for key products on important new and expected programs  including the airbus a xwb  the boeing and  the pratt whitney purepower tm pwg and the lockheed martin f lightning ii  the large installed base of commercial airplanes and our strong positions on newer  more fuel efficient airplanes  which should fuel sustained long term aftermarket strength  balance in the large commercial airplane market  with strong sales to both airbus and boeing  aging of the existing large commercial and regional airplane fleets  which should result in increased aftermarket support  increased number of long term agreements for product and service sales on new and existing commercial airplanes  increased opportunities for aftermarket growth due to airline outsourcing  
table of contents growth in global maintenance  repair and overhaul mro opportunities for our systems and components  particularly in europe  asia and the middle east  where we have expanded our capacity  and expansion of our product offerings in support of high growth areas in the defense and space market channel  such as helicopter products and systems and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance products

at certain sites we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are based on current facts  laws  regulations and technology 
these estimates take into consideration our prior experience and professional judgment of our environmental specialists 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites  third party indemnity obligations  and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of the accrued 
table of contents liability for environmental remediation were included in current liabilities as accrued expenses 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was associated with ongoing operations and million and million  respectively  was associated with previously owned businesses 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will generally complete remediation in less than years at sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 
certain states in the us and countries globally are promulgating or proposing new or more demanding regulations or legislation impacting the use of various chemical substances by all companies 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of complying with such regulations and legislation 
during  a judgment in our favor became final when the initial verdict was upheld on appeal 
as a result  we received million from commercial union insurance company for reimbursement of environmental remediation costs  attorney fees and interest  however  we paid a portion of the insurance proceeds to a former subsidiary 
see note  discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
asbestos we and some of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging damages as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers in products or at our facilities 
a number of these cases involve maritime claims  which have been and are expected to continue to be administratively dismissed by the court 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future legislative or other developments will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
insurance coverage we maintain a comprehensive portfolio of insurance policies  including aviation products liability insurance which covers most of our products 
the aviation products liability insurance typically provides first dollar coverage for defense and indemnity of third party claims 
a portion of our historical primary and excess layers of pre insurance coverage for third party claims was provided by certain insurance carriers who are either insolvent  undergoing solvent schemes of arrangement or in run off 
we have entered into settlement agreements with a number of these insurers pursuant to which we agreed to give up our rights with respect to certain insurance policies in exchange for negotiated payments 
these settlements represent negotiated payments for our loss of insurance coverage  as we no longer have this insurance available for claims that may have qualified for coverage 
a portion of these settlements was recorded as income for reimbursement of past claim payments under the settled insurance policies and a portion was recorded as a deferred settlement credit for future claim payments 
at december  and  the deferred settlement credit was million and million  respectively  for which million and million  respectively  was reported in accrued expenses and million and million  respectively  was reported in other non current liabilities 
the proceeds from such insurance settlements were reported as a component of net cash provided by operating activities in the period payments were received 

table of contents liabilities of divested businesses asbestos in may  we completed the tax free spin off of our engineered industrial products eip segment  which at the time of the spin off included enpro industries  inc enpro and coltec industries inc coltec 
at that time  two subsidiaries of coltec were defendants in a significant number of personal injury claims relating to alleged asbestos containing products sold by those subsidiaries prior to our ownership 
it is possible that asbestos related claims might be asserted against us on the theory that we have some responsibility for the asbestos related liabilities of enpro  coltec or its subsidiaries 
a limited number of asbestos related claims have been asserted against us as successor to coltec or one of its subsidiaries 
we believe that we have substantial legal defenses against these and other such claims 
in addition  the agreement between enpro and us that was used to effectuate the spin off provides us with an indemnification from enpro covering  among other things  these liabilities 
we believe that such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in a particular period 
other in connection with the divestiture of our tire  vinyl and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
guarantees at december   we had letters of credit and bank guarantees of million and residual value guarantees of lease obligations of million 
see note  financing arrangements and note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we were a guarantor on a revolving credit agreement totaling million between rolls royce goodrich engine control systems limited jv and a financial institution 
in addition  we guarantee the jv s foreign exchange credit line and we are indemnified by rolls royce for 
aerostructures long term contracts our aerostructures business in the nacelles and interior systems segment has several long term contracts in the pre production phase including the boeing and airbus a xwb  and in the early production phase including the airbus a these contracts are accounted for in accordance with long term construction contract accounting 
the pre production phase includes design of the product to meet customer specifications as well as design of the processes to manufacture the product 
also involved in this phase is securing the supply of material and subcomponents produced by third party suppliers that are generally accomplished through long term supply agreements 
contracts in the early production phase include excess over average inventories  which represent the excess of current manufactured cost over the estimated average manufactured cost during the life of the contract 
cost estimates over the lives of contracts are affected by estimates of future cost reductions including learning curve efficiencies 
because these contracts cover manufacturing periods of up to years or more  there is risk associated with the estimates of future costs made during the 
table of contents pre production and early production phases 
these estimates may be different from actual costs due to the following ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  anticipated cost productivity improvements related to new manufacturing methods and processes  supplier pricing  including escalation where applicable  potential supplier claims  the supplier s financial viability and the supplier s ability to perform  the cost impact of product design changes that frequently occur during the flight test and certification phases of a program  and effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
additionally  total contract revenue is based on estimates of future units to be delivered to the customer  the ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims and sales price escalation  where applicable 
there is a risk that there could be differences between the actual units delivered and the estimated total units to be delivered under the contract and differences in actual revenues compared to estimates 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period such losses are determined to the extent total estimated costs exceed total estimated contract revenues 
boeing contract during  our aerostructures business entered into a long term supply contract with boeing on the program 
our latest outlook projects approximately billion of original equipment sales for this contract 
at december   we had approximately million recorded as in process inventory related to this contract 
aftermarket sales associated with this program are not accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the boeing program has experienced delays in its development schedule and boeing has requested numerous changes in the design of our product and scope of our work 
under the terms of our contract  we are entitled to reimbursement of certain costs and equitable price adjustments under certain circumstances 
we have asserted changes to our pricing that are material 
discussions with boeing are ongoing 
in our evaluation of the contract  we have included an estimate of the probable revenues related to these assertions 
if we are unable to reach a fair and equitable resolution with boeing  if any key suppliers on the program fail to comply with the material terms of their supply contracts  or if any of the actual costs or revenues differ from the estimates  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows in a given period 
during  we entered into an agreement to settle the previously disclosed arbitration with alenia aermacchi  spa aaem  a supplier of fan cowls used in the nacelles that we provide to boeing on the program 
the material terms of the settlement agreement include a termination of the underlying program contracts between aaem and us and the orderly transfer of the fan cowl program to another supplier  b the supply of a specified number of fan cowls during the transfer period  c installment payments to aaem over an approximately two year period  subject to aaem s continued support for testing and certification and execution of the program transfer  and d termination of the arbitration with a mutual release of claims and covenant not to sue 
the payments to be made to aaem under the settlement agreement are

as a result of the settlement with aaem  we identified a preferred supplier for future fan cowl support and negotiated pricing on the and several other programs  taking into account the supplier s position as a preferred supplier 
jstars program in  seven q seven  ltd 
q was selected by northrop grumman corporation to provide propulsion pods for the re engine program for the jtd engines used by the us air force 
we were selected by q as a supplier for the inlet  thrust reverser  exhaust  ebu  strut systems and wing interface systems 
as of december   we have million of pre production costs related to this program 
funding for the jstars program for the budget cycle was approved 
future funding remains uncertain 
while we believe that program funding will continue  there can be no assurances of such 
if the program were to be cancelled  we would need to write off our pre production costs 
tax we are continuously undergoing examination by the united states internal revenue service irs  as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions 
the irs and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported by us on our income tax returns 
tax years and during  the irs issued a revenue agent s report for the tax years and in july  we submitted a protest to the appeals division of the irs with respect to certain unresolved issues which involve the proper timing of deductions 
although it is reasonably possible that these matters could be resolved during the next months  the timing or ultimate outcome is uncertain 
tax years to during  we reached agreement with the irs on substantially all of the issues raised with respect to the examination of taxable years to we submitted a protest to the appeals division of the irs with respect to the remaining unresolved issues which involve the proper timing of certain deductions 
we were unable to reach agreement with the irs on the remaining issues and in december  we filed a petition to the us tax court 
if the irs were to prevail  we believe the amount of the estimated tax liability is fully reserved 
we cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of a final resolution of the remaining unresolved issues 
tax years prior to the previous examination cycle included the consolidated income tax groups for the audit periods identified below coltec industries inc and subsidiaries december  july  through date of acquisition goodrich corporation and subsidiaries including rohr  inc rohr and coltec we previously reached final settlement with the irs on all but one of the issues raised in this examination cycle 
we received statutory notices of deficiency dated june  related to the remaining unresolved issue which involves the proper timing of certain deductions 
we filed a petition with the us tax court in september to contest the notices of deficiency 
if the irs were to prevail  we believe the amount of the estimated tax liability is fully reserved 

table of contents although it is reasonably possible that these matters could be resolved during the next months  the timing or ultimate outcome is uncertain 
rohr was examined by the state of california for the tax years ended july   and the state of california disallowed certain expenses incurred by one of rohr s subsidiaries in connection with the lease of certain tangible property 
california s franchise tax board held that the deductions associated with the leased equipment were non business deductions 
the additional tax associated with the franchise tax board s position is million 
the amount of accrued interest associated with the additional tax is approximately million at december  in addition  the state of california enacted an amnesty provision that imposes nondeductible penalty interest equal to of the unpaid interest amounts relating to taxable years ended before the penalty interest is approximately million at december  the tax and interest amounts continue to be contested by rohr 
no payment has been made for the million of interest or million of penalty interest 
in april  the superior court of california issued a ruling granting our motion for summary judgment 
in august the state of california appealed the ruling 
once the state s appeals have been exhausted and if the superior court s decision is not overturned  we will be entitled to a refund of the million of tax  together with interest from the date of payment 
following settlement of the us tax court for rohr s tax years to  california audited our amended tax returns and issued an assessment based on numerous issues including proper timing of deductions and allowance of tax credits 
we submitted a protest of the assessment to the california franchise tax board in november we believe that we are adequately reserved for this contingency 
although it is reasonably possible that these matters could be resolved during the next months  the timing or ultimate outcome is uncertain 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in june  new accounting guidance was issued that is included in accounting standards codification topic  consolidation 
this statement amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities and is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after november  upon adoption  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  share based compensation  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contract accounting percentage of completion we have sales under long term contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
we use the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability are known 
amounts representing contract claims or change orders are considered in estimating revenues  costs  and profits when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
estimates of revenue and cost for our contracts span a period of many years from the inception of the contracts to the date of actual shipments and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying factors are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the assumptions of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the factors change 
the factors include but are not limited to estimates of the following escalation of future sales prices under the contracts  ability to recover costs incurred for change orders and claims  costs  including material and labor costs and related escalation  labor improvements due to the learning curve experience  anticipated cost productivity improvements related to new manufacturing methods and processes  supplier pricing  including escalation where applicable  potential supplier claims  the supplier s financial viability and the supplier s ability to perform  the cost impact of product design changes that frequently occur during the flight test and certification phases of a program  and effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain pre production costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
during the early years of a contract  manufacturing costs per unit delivered are typically greater than the estimated average unit cost for the total contract 
this excess manufacturing cost for units shipped results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period identified  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
unbilled receivables our aerostructures business is party to a long term supply arrangement whereby we receive cash payments for our performance over a period that extends beyond our performance period of the 
table of contents contract 
the contract is accounted for using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
unbilled receivables include revenue recognized that will be realized from cash payments to be received beyond the period of performance 
in estimating our revenues to be received under the contract  cash receipts that are expected to be received beyond the performance period are included at their present value as of the end of the performance period 
product maintenance arrangements we have entered into long term product maintenance arrangements to provide specific products and services to customers for a specified amount per flight hour  brake landing and or aircraft landings 
revenue is recognized as the service is performed and the costs are incurred 
we have sufficient historical evidence that indicates that the costs of performing the service under the contract are incurred on other than a straight line basis 
income taxes as of each interim reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
in addition  we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions and estimates as to the amount and jurisdictional source of income expected to be earned during the full fiscal year 
further influencing this estimate are evolving interpretations of new and existing tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions 
due to the subjective and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related groups of assets  may not be recoverable and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful lives is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit margin assumption is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
changes to these assumptions could result in the recognition of impairment 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually  or when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
our annual testing date is november we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the amount of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
as of our november testing date  none of our reporting units were at risk of their book value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any impairment exists 
the cash flow forecasts 
table of contents are adjusted by a long term growth rate and a discount rate derived from our weighted average cost of capital at the date of evaluation 
other assets as with any investment  there are risks inherent in recovering the value of participation payments  sales incentives  flight certification costs and entry fees 
such risks are consistent with the risks associated in acquiring a revenue producing asset in which market conditions may change or the risks that arise when a manufacturer of a product on which a royalty is based has business difficulties and cannot produce the product 
such risks include but are not limited to the following changes in market conditions that may affect product sales under the program  including market acceptance and competition from others  performance of subcontract suppliers and other production risks  bankruptcy or other less significant financial difficulties of other program participants  including the aircraft manufacturer  the oe manufacturers oem and other program suppliers or the aircraft customer  and availability of specialized raw materials in the marketplace 
participation payments certain of our businesses make cash payments under long term contractual arrangements to oem or system contractors in return for a secured position on an aircraft program 
participation payments are capitalized  when a contractual liability has been incurred  as other assets and amortized as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and  the carrying amount of participation payments was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of participation payments is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of units or a revision in the economics of the program 
if such estimates change  amortization expense is adjusted and or an impairment charge is recorded  as appropriate  for the effect of the revised estimates 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives such as up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products to certain airline customers in connection with sales contracts 
the cost of these incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless recovery of these costs is specifically guaranteed by the customer in the contract 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized as other assets and amortized to cost of sales  or as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and  the carrying amount of sales incentives was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of sales incentives is evaluated for recovery when indicators of potential impairment exist 
the carrying value of the sales incentives is also compared annually to the amount recoverable under the terms of the guarantee in the customer contract 
if the amount of the carrying value of the sales incentives exceeds the amount recoverable in the contract  the carrying value is reduced 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
flight certification costs when a supply arrangement is secured  certain of our businesses may agree to supply hardware to an oem to be used in flight certification testing and or make cash payments to reimburse an 
table of contents oem for costs incurred in testing the hardware 
the flight certification testing is necessary to certify aircraft systems components for the aircraft s airworthiness and allows the aircraft to be flown and thus sold in the country certifying the aircraft 
flight certification costs are capitalized in other assets and are amortized to cost of sales  or as a reduction to sales  as appropriate 
at december  and  the carrying amount of sales flight certification costs was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of flight certification costs is evaluated for recovery when indicators of impairment exist or when the estimated number of units to be manufactured changes 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
entry fees our aerostructures business in our nacelles and interior systems segment made a cash payment to an oem under a long term contractual arrangement related to a new engine program 
the payments are referred to as entry fees and entitle us to a controlled access supply contract and a percentage of total program revenue generated by the oem 
entry fees are capitalized in other assets and are amortized over units of delivery as a reduction to sales 
at december  and  the carrying amount of entry fees was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of entry fees is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other significant assumptions or economic conditions change 
recovery of entry fees is assessed based on the expected cash flow from the program over the remaining program life as compared to the recorded amount of entry fees 
if the carrying value of the entry fees exceeds the cash flow to be generated from the program  a charge would be recorded to reduce the entry fees to their recoverable amounts 
no such impairment charges were recorded in  or see note  supplemental balance sheet information to our consolidated financial statements 
service and product warranties we provide service and warranty policies on certain of our products 
we accrue liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues 
our service and product warranty reserves are based upon a variety of factors 
any significant change in these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations 
such factors include but are not limited to the following the historical performance of our products and changes in performance of newer products  the mix and volumes of products being sold  and the impact of product changes 
share based compensation we utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share based compensation awards 
see note  share based compensation 
assumptions stock options we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the expected value that our employees will receive from the options based on a number of assumptions  such as interest rates  
table of contents employee exercises  our stock price and expected dividend yield 
our weighted average assumptions included risk free interest rate expected dividend yield historical volatility factor weighted average expected life of the options years the expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate  historical volatility and expected dividend yield must be applied 
the expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options 
it is based on our historical experience with similar grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the expected us treasury rate over the expected life 
historical volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life 
expected dividend yield is based on the stated dividend rate as of the date of grant 
restricted stock units the fair value of the restricted stock units is determined based upon the average of the high and low grant date fair value 
the weighted average grant date fair value during  and was  and per unit  respectively 
performance units the value of each award is determined based upon the average of the high and low price of our stock on the last day of each reporting period  as adjusted for a performance condition and a market condition 
the performance condition is applied to of the awards and is based upon our actual return on invested capital roic as compared to a target roic 
the market condition is applied to of the awards and is based on our relative total shareholder return rtsr as compared to the rtsr of a peer group of companies 
since the awards will be paid in cash  they are recorded as a liability award and are marked to market each reporting period 
as such  assumptions are evaluated for each award on an ongoing basis 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions we consult with an outside actuary as to the appropriateness for many of the assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our worldwide pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions 
all significant assumptions are evaluated at least annually 
assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase  health care cost projections  the mortality rate assumption  and the long term rate of return on plan assets are based upon our historical and benchmark data  as well as our outlook for the future 
plan assets have been valued at fair value 
see note  pensions and postretirement benefits 
the us discount rate was determined based on a customized yield curve approach 
our projected pension and postretirement benefit payment cash flows were each plotted against a yield curve composed of a large  diverse group of aa rated corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rates were used to determine the benefit obligations 
in canada and the uk  a similar approach to determining discount rates in the us was utilized 
the appropriate benchmarks by applicable country were used for pension plans other than those in the us  us and canada to determine the discount rate assumptions 

table of contents sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the approximate impact at december  of a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plan cost and liability  holding all other assumptions constant 
the discount rate assumption is selected each year based on market conditions in effect as of the disclosure date 
the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the disclosure date and for calculating the following year s pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption  although reviewed each year  is changed less frequently due to the long term nature of the assumption 
this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of disclosure date  rather  it is used only in the calculation of pension expense
