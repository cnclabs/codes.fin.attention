item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business 
an economic downturn could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
home furnishings are generally considered a postponeable purchase by most consumers 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  hooker s primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales or earnings 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  and geopolitical factors have particular significant effects on our company 
a recovery in the company s sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn due to the postponeable nature and re latively significant cost of home furnishings purchases 
we may lose market share due to competition  which would decrease future sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
hooker competes with many domestic and foreign manufacturers 
some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign producers has increased dramatically over the past decade 
we may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  including increases in supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of our competitors 
in addition  large retail furniture dealers have the ability and could at any time begin to obtain offshore sourcing on their own 
as a result  we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which may lower sales and earnings 
failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business and decrease sales and earnings 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes  as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles 
if we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could result in lower sales and earnings 
a loss of several large customers through business consolidations  failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in future sales and earnings 
the loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations  failures or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our sales and earnings 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to hooker by a customer whose business fails  or is failing  may become uncollectible 
our ability to grow sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of our business strategies 
we are primarily a residential furniture design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company with domestic upholstery manufacturing capabilities 
our ability to maintain and grow sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of our overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing  distributing and servicing our products 
we must also make good decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets 
since we have exited domestic manufacturing of wood furniture and are now completely dependent on offshore suppliers for wood and metal furniture products  we must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow us to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with our global sourcing supp liers 
we must also continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect our ability to grow sales and earnings 

table of contents we depend on suppliers in china for a very high proportion of our imported furniture products  and a disruption in supply from china or from our most significant chinese supplier could undermine our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and adversely affect our sourcing costs 
in fiscal  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of our import purchases and the factory in china from which we directly source the largest portion of our import products accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported products 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory to adequately meet demand for approximately four months 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect net sales and profit margins 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in us dollars  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could adversely impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods 
our dependence on offshore suppliers could  over time  adversely affect our ability to service customers  which could lower future sales and earnings 
we rely exclusively on offshore suppliers for our wood and metal furniture products 
our offshore suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if our suppliers do not meet our specifications  we may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from offshore vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured wood and metal furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues 
our failure to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption by a major offshore supplier could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in decreased sales and e arnings 
we rely on offshore sourcing for all of our wood and metal products  and for some of our upholstered products 
we are subject to changes in local government regulations  which could result in a decrease in earnings 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we source our products could have an adverse impact on our performance 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to customers 
international trade policies of the united states and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings 
for example beginning in  the us department of commerce has imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed were of sufficient magnitude to a lter our import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these tariffs are subject to review and could be increased in the future 
if demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and we respond by realigning manufacturing  our near term earnings could decrease 
our domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we may decide to source certain products from offshore suppliers  instead of continuing to manufacture them domestically 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near term earnings before the expected cost reductions from realignment are realized 
we may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated an d may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions 

table of contents fluctuations in the price  availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase costs  any of which could decrease our sales or earnings 
we use various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
we do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the loss of future sales 
we may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to our customers due to competition an d market pressures 
we may experience impairment of our long lived assets  which would decrease earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment when circumstances indicate  but at least annually 
we have million in net long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks and trade names  which based upon the outcome of the annual test  could result in the write down of all or a portion of these assets 
a write down of our assets would  in turn  reduce our earnings and net worth 
over the past three fiscal years  we have written down million in long lived assets 
it is possible that we will have additional write downs in the future  resulting in additional reductions to our earnings and net worth 
factors which may lead to additional write downs of our long lived assets include a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived assets use  or a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life we may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies  which could disrupt our business  dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock 
we may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages 
however  we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
we may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business 
we may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination of these 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share

after the fiscal year that ended november   our fiscal years will end on the sunday closest to january in connection with the change in our fiscal year  we had a two month transition period that ended january item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this annual report 
our fiscal years end on the sunday closest to january  in some years generally once every six years the fourth quarter will be fourteen weeks long and the fiscal year will consist of fifty three weeks for example  the fiscal year that ended february  was fifty three weeks 
our quarterly periods are based on thirteen week reporting periods which will end on a sunday rather than quarterly periods consisting of three calendar months 
as a result  each quarterly period generally will be thirteen weeks  or days  long 
the financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k include the fifty two week period that began february  and ended on january  fiscal  fifty two week period that began february  and ended on february  fiscal  fifty three week period that began january  and ended on february  fiscal  overview we have seen a growing consumer preference for lower priced  high quality imported furniture products since led by this change in consumer demand  from to we systematically increased our focus on high quality imported home furnishings with a coordinated exit from domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
we closed our last domestic wood manufacturing plant during the fiscal year first quarter and completed the sale of all wood furniture manufacturing assets no longer needed in the business in december as a result  we have replaced a domestic manufacturing model for wood furniture  which had high overhead and high fixed costs  with a low overhead  variable cost import model 
in early  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of sam moore furniture industries  inc  a bedford  virginia manufacturer of upscale occasional chairs with an emphasis on fabric to frame customization in the upper medium to high end price niches 
we began operating the business as sam moore furniture llc during the fiscal second quarter 
on december   we completed our acquisition of certain assets of opus designs furniture  llc  a specialist in moderately priced imported youth furniture 
we have integrated this business with our existing imported wood and metal furniture business and now offer this brand to customers as opus designs by hooker 

table of contents we are now focused on imported wood and metal furniture  and both domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings 
maintaining domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing allows us to offer four to six week turnaround on orders for custom leather and fabric upholstered seating and remains an important part of our strategy 
since the fall of  our business has been impacted by low levels of consumer confidence and a weak housing market 
by late  this malaise  exacerbated by weak credit markets  had spread to the broader us economy 
as a result  the residential home furnishings industry has seen an unprecedented decline in demand for its products 
year over year declines in net sales have continued through the fiscal results of operations for the fifty two weeks ended january  and february  and the fifty three weeks ended february  reflect the continuing deterioration in the retail environment for home furnishings 
discretionary purchases of furniture  particularly at the upper middle price points  have been highly affected by low consumer confidence 
current economic factors  such as rising unemployment and difficult housing and mortgage markets  have resulted in a weak retail environment 
we believe however  that our business model provides us with flexibility to respond to changing market conditions by adjusting import inventory purchases from suppliers 
we also believe that the current economic downturn is te mporary and upon economic recovery  we will be well positioned to respond quickly to increased demand 
following are the principal factors that impacted our results of operations during the fifty two week period ended january  net sales declined by million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million during fiscal year the continuing decline in net sales mirrors the year over year decline in incoming order rates we have experienced since the fiscal third quarter resulting from an industry wide slow down in business at retail 
gross margins for fiscal improved due primarily to lower freight costs on wood and metal furniture and primarily due to lower inventories for the year as well as stable pricing on imports  however  gross margins in our upholstery units declined due to higher fixed costs as a percent of net sales 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in absolute terms compared to fiscal year but increased as a percent of net sales due to the effect of the fixed nature of certain selling and administrative costs as a percent of the lower net sales reported in fiscal operating income decreased principally due to lower net sales  higher fixed operating and domestic upholstery overhead costs as a percent of net sales and impairment charges of million related to the impairment of the our bradington young and opus designs trade names  partially offset by an approximate  favorable adjustment to our workers compensation accrual due to the exit from our captive insurance arrangement 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items for the annual periods included in the consolidated statements of income fifty three fifty two weeks ended weeks ended january  february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses restructuring credits charges goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  hooker furniture reported net sales of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal net sales of our wood and metal furniture decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal  principally due to lower unit volume 
the decline in wood and metal furniture unit volume was attributed to a sharp decline in sales as a result of the industry wide slow down in business at retail 
unit volume decreased for hooker wood and metal furniture  bradington young domestic leather upholstery and sam moore upholstered furniture compared to fiscal unit volume increased for bradington young imported leather upholstery 
sales of imported upholstery increased less than one percent from the prior year  while domestic upholstery sales declined approximately in the same period 
these unit volume declines were partially offset by sales of our new envision product line  which was recently introduced to address the needs of a younger consumer 
overall average selling prices decreased less than two percent in the fiscal year compared to the period 
selling price increases implemented in september in response to higher costs for imported finished goods and raw materials for domestically produced upholstery were offset by aggressive discounting 
only sam moore s imported upholstered furniture showed higher average selling prices in fiscal this was primarily due to the mix of products sold 

table of contents overall gross profit margin for fiscal increased to of net sales compared to in fiscal due to margin improvements in the case goods division partially offset by lower gross margins in the upholstery operations 
wood furniture margins improved from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal primarily due to lower shipping costs on imported wood furniture and lower warehousing costs in the case goods operation due to the elimination of a distribution facility in california  partially offset by higher discounting 
upholstery margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher fixed operating costs as a percent of net sales resulting primarily from lower net sales in fiscal for fiscal  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  compared with million in  largely due to lower selling expense attributed to lower sales volume  reduced salaries and benefits due to staff reductions  a favorable adjustment of  to our worker s compensation accrual due to the exit from our captive insurance arrangement  and lower bonuses and severance payments than in as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in the fiscal period  due primarily to lower net sales 
during fiscal  we recorded million  after tax  or per share in intangible asset impairment charges related to the write down of our bradington young and opus designs trade names 
during fiscal  we recorded million million after tax  or per share in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  principally related to a write off of million in goodwill resulting from the acquisition of opus designs a write off of million in goodwill remaining from the company s purchase of bradington young in  and an impairment charge of million in the value of the bradington young trade name 
additionally  we recorded restructuring credits of   after tax or per share in fiscal for previously accrued employee benefits and environmental remediation costs not expected to be paid 
because of the factors outlined above  our operating income margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales  compared to operating income margin of of net sales for fiscal wood furniture operating margins declined modestly from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal  reflecting the variable cost oriented import business model  while upholstery operating margins declined from of net sales to of net sales due to the impact of lower sales on the higher fixed cost structure of our domestic upholstery manufacturing facilities 
excluding the effect of restructuring and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  operating profitability in fiscal still declined year over year compared to fiscal the following table reconciles operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin to operating margin excluding these charges and credits restructuring and special charges credits as a percentage of net sales for each period january  february  operating margin  including restructuring and special charges goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges restructuring credits charges operating margin  excluding restructuring and special credits charges

non gaap financial measures are intended to provide insight into selected financial information and should be evaluated in the context in which they are presented 
these measures are not intended to reflect our overall financial results 
other expense  net was  for fiscal  compared to other income  net of  for fiscal the decline was primarily the consequence of a decrease in interest income on cash balances from lower interest rates and lower interest expense due to the early payoff of our term loan 
our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase was principally a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state net operating loss carryforwards  a late payment penalty and recognition of subpart f income 
the dollar amounts of the permanent benefits for officers life insurance and contributions of property were not materially different than in prior years 
their percentages are larger this year because of the smaller amount of pre tax income 
net income for fiscal declined by  or million  to million  or per share  from million  or per share  for fiscal as a percent of net sales  net income decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  hooker furniture reported net sales of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal net sales of our wood and metal furniture decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal  principally due to lower unit volume 
the decline in wood and metal furniture unit volume was attributed to a sharp decline in sales as a result of the industry wide slow down in business at retail and lower shipments of discontinued domestically produced wood furniture 
based on operating days in each period  and excluding the impact of discontinued  domestically produced wood furniture  average daily net sales declined to million per day during the day fiscal year  compared to million per day during the day fiscal year 
we experienced lower average daily unit volume shipments overall and in every product category  except youth bedroom and upholstered seating  which increased due to the acquisition of opus designs in december and the inclusion of a full year of sales for sam moore  which was acquired in april overall  average selling prices declined significantly 
the primary contributors to the overall decline were  the sharp drop in the average selling price of upholstered furniture 
this drop was due to the increased proportion of upholstery sales of less expensive  predominantly fabric covered products manufactured by sam moore  which was in its first full year as a hooker subsidiary  and the impact of our exit from the domestic wood and metal furniture business 
the unit volume of higher priced domestically produced wood products was partially replaced by lower priced imports 
the remaining domestic wood products were heavily discounted during fiscal the average selling price for imported wood and metal furniture decreased due to heavier discounting in a challenging market and the mix of products shipped 
bradington young s imported and domestically produced leather upholstered furniture showed higher average selling prices while sam moore s average prices declined in both categories 

table of contents gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales compared to in fiscal  primarily due to increased product and shipping and warehousing costs  lower fixed cost absorption due to lower sales of domestically produced upholstered furniture  and higher warehousing and distribution expenses due to the addition of two facilities in china and one in california 
these costs were partially offset by lower salary and benefit expenses resulting from staff reductions at our bradington young and domestic wood and metal furniture operations 
for fiscal  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  compared with million in  due to last year s donation of two former bradington young s showrooms to a local university  and lower selling expenses  professional fees and administrative payroll costs 
these costs were partially offset by higher bad debt expenses

debt covenant compliance the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility contains  among other things  financial covenants as to minimum tangible net worth  the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash charges and maximum capital expenditures 
we are in compliance with these covenants as of january  swap agreements we are party to an interest rate swap agreement that provided  in effect  for a fixed interest rate on our term loans through september  prior to our fiscal third quarter  we accounted for our interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge  and recognized the fair value of the agreement on the balance sheet in shareholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
the related gains or losses on this instrument were recorded through comprehensive income loss and  accordingly  were included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet until recognized in net income 
in connection with the amendment of our credit agreement  effective august   we repaid our term loans in full 
as a result  our interest rate swap no longer qualified as an effective hedge and we recognized a charge of  to income  which represented the balance under accumulated other comprehensive income on the date the loans were repaid 
through the remainder of the term of this interest rate swap  which terminates on september   all future changes in the swap s fair value will be charged against net income 
during our fiscal year ended january   we recognized aggregate charges of  against net income for the change in the swap s fair value after the date our term loans were repaid 

table of contents in addition  in we terminated a similar swap agreement  which  prior to its termination  provided  in effect  a fixed interest rate on our term loans 
we made a million payment to terminate that former swap agreement  which through the periods ended august  was being amortized over the remaining repayment period of the loans 
upon the repayment of our terms loans  we wrote off the remaining  unamortized balance of this swap termination payment during the fiscal third quarter 
amendment of credit agreement and repayment of term loans on august   we amended our credit agreement 
the amendment included the following terms upon execution of the amendment  we were required to repay in full the remaining balance of the term loans outstanding under the agreement million  plus accrued interest  effective as of july   the funded debt to ebitda ratio under the credit agreement was changed from to  and effective as of july   the debt service coverage ratio under the credit agreement was eliminated

a copy of the amendment was included as exhibit to our form k  filed with the sec on august liquidity  financial resources and capital expenditures as of january   we had an aggregate million available under our revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs 
standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of january  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line on january  any principal outstanding under the credit line is due march  we believe that we have the financial resources including available cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  and lines of credit needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  and working capital  as well as to pay dividends on our common stock  and repayments of outstanding debt 
cash flow from operations is highly dependent on incoming order rates and our operating performance 
we expect to spend to million in capital expenditures during fiscal year to maintain and enhance our operating systems and facilities 
woodleaf closing during our fiscal second quarter  we decided to transition frame production from our bradington young woodleaf  north carolina plant a leased facility to bradington young s cherryville  north carolina facility by the end of december on july   we announced our plans to sell the frame production operation  including the associated machinery and equipment  as an on going business 
however  at november  we had not found  and did not anticipate finding  a buyer for this operation 
consequently  during the fiscal third quarter  we recorded  for severance the majority of which was paid during our fiscal fourth quarter and  in accelerated depreciation on fixed assets utilized at this location 
we recorded an additional  in accelerated depreciation du ring our fiscal fourth quarter and have exited this location 
we expect that exiting the woodleaf operation and moving frame production to cherryville will reduce fixed overhead costs by approximately  annually or about to per share after tax following the completion of the transition period beginning in fiscal 
table of contents supplier commitments from may through september  we advanced payments to  and provided financing guarantees for  one of our finished goods suppliers to facilitate the supplier s purchase of raw materials and other related items in order to help ensure timely delivery of finished goods to us 
the balance of the advances and other miscellaneous amounts to this supplier at january  was  in order for the supplier to obtain additional bank financing  we issued a standby letter of credit on july  as security in the amount of  in conjunction with the issuance of the letter of credit  we entered into a security agreement with the supplier and the supplier s shareholders  which provides us with a security interest in certain assets of the supplier and its shareholders 
during september  prior t o the expiration of the letter of credit  the supplier ceased operations  and defaulted on its bank notes  and its lender drew on our  letter of credit 
subsequently  we reimbursed our letter of credit provider for the  due to the location and nature of the pledged collateral  we may incur substantial costs to obtain and foreclose on it 
consequently  we recorded a charge of  during the third quarter of fiscal to write down the value of the pledged collateral to our estimate of its net realizable value  and charges totaling  during the our third and fourth quarters of fiscal to reserve against the potential uncollectability of the outstanding advances and other miscellaneous amounts due from the supplier 
the estimated net realizable amount for the pledged collateral of  as of january  is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other assets 
based on a recent appraisal  we believe that the net realizable value of  is reasonable and approximates the collateral s fair value 
we are currently working with the supplier and its shareholders to have the pledged collateral conveyed to us 
common stock and dividends since february   our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of million of our common stock in a series of repurchase authorizations  subject to the limitations of a trading plan under rule b of the securities exchange act of and certain board imposed guidelines 
we completed these share repurchases in august on january   awards totaling  shares of restricted common stock were granted to the five non employee members of our board of directors

table of contents standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of january  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line on january  strategy and outlook our strategy is to offer world class style  quality and product value as a complete residential wood  metal and upholstered furniture resource through excellence in product design  global sourcing  manufacturing  logistics  sales  marketing and customer service 
we strive to be an industry leader in sales growth and profitability performance  thereby providing an outstanding investment for our shareholders and contributing to the well being of our employees  customers  suppliers and community neighbors 
additionally  we strive to nurture the relationship focused  team oriented and honor driven corporate culture that has distinguished our company for over years 
we have been executing this strategy since in part through exiting domestic wood furniture manufacturing to concentrate on imported wood and metal and domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings  expanding product offerings to become a more complete and important resource to our furniture retailers through the acquisitions of upholstery manufacturers bradington young llc and sam moore llc  and in youth furniture lines through the purchase of opus designs llc and by organically expanding the styles and price points offered in existing product lines  and the introduction of our envision product line in april  which was designed to meet the needs of a younger and less affluent consumer and debuted on sales floors during our fiscal year third quarter 
continuing to improve and expand our supply chain capabilities  with improvements in forecasting and demand planning software and stock keeping unit sku optimization  filling key leadership positions with people who have the skill sets and experience needed under our new business model  and expanding service capabilities for our container direct customers by adding warehousing at two important suppliers plants in china 
the year over year declines in quarterly incoming orders  which began in the fall of  continued during our fiscal year 
we believe that recovery may be slow  irregular  and easily derailed 
our outlook for fiscal is one of continued cautious optimism 
we believe that our product  inventory availability  and business model uniquely position us to take advantage of any upturn in the economy 
that optimism  however  is tempered by the uniqueness of the present economic situation 
thus  we believe that continued attention to cost control is necessary 
our new envision product line was introduced in april and debuted on retail sales floors during the fiscal year third quarter 
while response to this new line has been encouraging  we have not yet seen an overall rebound in purchases of big ticket consumer products such as furniture 
so we remain cautious in our planning and continue to take actions to address challenges to our profitability 
some of those actions include deferring  reducing or eliminating certain spending plans  continuing to refine the management of our supply chain  warehousing and distribution operations  and adjusting our inventory levels to reflect current business conditions and lower sales volumes 
the performance of our domestic upholstery operations have been particularly impacted by the prolonged sales downturn due to the higher fixed overhead costs for those operations as a percentage of reduced net sales 
to mitigate the impact of these sales declines we are pursuing additional distribution channels and offering an array of new products and designs that we believe will generate sales growth  taking actions to streamline our domestic upholstery operations  improve efficiency and reduce overhead  and  continuing to evaluate our manufacturing capacity utilization  work schedules and operating costs to better match costs to current sales volume levels 

table of contents due to excess capacity  our upholstery division reported an operating loss of of net sales for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of of net sales for fiscal we have responded to this decline in performance by intensifying our focus on cost reduction and sales growth initiatives for our upholstery operations including reductions of personnel  consolidating manufacturing facilities  implementing lean manufacturing process improvement technology and introducing technological changes to reduce labor costs 
in terms of sales growth  we have focused on updating our upholstery lines with more contemporary offerings while retaining our best selling traditionally styled items 
consequently  we recently introduced the envision line and the paris flea market collection  which integrates stand alone elements from al l three hooker brands including both upholstery and wood furniture in a fresh and exciting way 
we believe both envision and paris flea market represent a compelling value for consumers and will ultimately drive sales across the entire company 
we are encouraged by the response to these product offerings at the spring and fall international home furnishings markets 
with continued emphasis on cost control and product development  coupled with a continued improvement in business  we believe we can return our upholstery division to profitability in fiscal fourth quarter results of operations suggest that recovery will be slow and inconsistent 
wood furniture sales of million in the fiscal fourth quarter declined million  or  from the fiscal fourth quarter  while upholstery sales fared better  showing a million increase from million in the fiscal fourth quarter to million in the fiscal period 
wood furniture gross margins were improved from of net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter to of net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter  due principally to lower freight costs on imported furniture and the impact of cost reduction initiatives  while upholstery gross margins declined slightly from of net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter to of net sales in the fiscal period despite the higher net sales due to higher discounting and costs incurred to exit our woodleaf  nc frame manufacturing facility 
wood furniture operating margins improved from of net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter to in the fiscal quarter due to lower freight costs  cost reduction initiatives and  lower intangible asset impairment charges  while upholstery operating margins improved to of net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter  from of net sales in the fiscal quarter  principally due to lower intangible asset impairment charges million in the current year  partially offset by slightly higher cost of goods sold and operating costs on higher sales volumes  but also as a percent of net sales 
environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of our business operations  our manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
we are in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position 
our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with our environ mental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 
critical accounting policies and estimates hooker furniture s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that actual results will deviate materially from our estimates related to our accounting policies described be low 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  we analyze the payment history of our significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general condition of the economy  we develop what we consider to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from our estimate 

table of contents valuation of inventories 
we value all of our inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of our inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of sales  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of sales and lower profitability as compared to the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory for excess or slow moving items b ased on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
we establish an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual values may differ materially from our estimate 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets tangible assets we regularly review our property  plant and equipment for indicators of impairment  as specified in the property  plant  and equipment topic of the accounting standards codification 
although not exhaustive  this accounting guidance lists potential indicators of impairment  which we use to facilitate our review 
these potential indicators of impairment include a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived assets use  or a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the impairment test for our property  plant and equipment requires us to assess the recoverability of the value of the assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from use and eventual disposition of the assets 
we principally use our internal forecasts to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows used in our impairment analyses 
these forecasts are subjective and are largely based on management s judgment  primarily due to the changing industry in which we compete  changing consumer tastes  trends  and demographics  and the current economic environment 
we monitor changes in these factors as part of the quarter end review of these assets 
while our forecasts have been reasonably accurate in the past  during periods of economic instabil ity  uncertainty  or rapid change within our industry  we may not be able to accurately forecast future cash flows from our long lived assets and our future cash flows may be diminished 
therefore  our estimates and assumptions related to the viability of our long lived assets may change  and are reasonably likely to change in future periods 
these changes could adversely affect our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of financial position 
as of january   the fair value of our property  plant and equipment was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
when we conclude that any of these assets is impaired  the asset is written down to its fair value 
any impaired assets that we expect to dispose of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when we commit to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits to be paid to terminated employees affected by the facility closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
we recognize liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of facilities are based on our best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
we reassess our accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting per iod 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs 

table of contents intangible assets we own certain indefinite lived intangible assets related to bradington young  sam moore and opus designs by hooker 
we may acquire additional amortizable assets and or indefinite lived intangible assets in future asset purchases or business combinations 
the principal indefinite lived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names which are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the estimated earnings and cash flow capacity of those assets 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible ass ets exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment include a significant adverse change in the economic or business climate either within the furniture industry or the national or global economy  significant changes in demand for our products  loss of key personnel  or the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our intangible assets are highly subjective and judgmental and include long term growth rates  sales volumes  projected revenues  assumed royalty rates and factors used to develop an applied discount rate 
if the assumptions that we use in these calculations differ from actual results  we may realize additional impairment on our intangible assets which may have a material  adverse affect on our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets 
based on assumptions used in the valuation of our opus designs trade names  any further deterioration in the inputs used to value the trade name at january  would result in additional impairment 
the fair value of our bradington young and sam moore trade names were substantially in excess of their carrying values at january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hooker furniture is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our results of operations or financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements with respect to interest rates 
from time to time we have entered into swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt instruments 
by using swap agreements to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the swap agreement 
we attempt to minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties 
market risk is the potential adverse effect on the value of the swap agreement that results from a decline in interest rates 
the market risk associated with interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may b e undertaken 
amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates 
there was no outstanding balance under our revolver as of january  therefore  a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing denominated in us dollars with our foreign suppliers  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
most of our imports are purchased from china 
the chinese currency now floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in additional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
we generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume or profit margins during affected periods
