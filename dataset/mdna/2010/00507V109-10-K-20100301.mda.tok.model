table of contents key market conditions and business results market conditions were challenging in with total retail software sales in the us and europe down from the prior year  according to the npd group  charttrack  and gfk 
with the weakened economy  retailers focused on reducing inventories 
the market weakness was most notable in the casual game and music genres  as compared to core gamer performing titles  with casual consumers scaling back their purchases  including making fewer purchases of higher priced point peripheral based games in the music genre 
for  activision blizzard s consolidated net revenues were  million  and consolidated net income was million  which included a million charge from the impairment of finite lived intangible assets reflecting the impact of the weaker market for the casual and music genres 
the company generated  million in net cash from operating activities 
notwithstanding  this challenging macroeconomic environment  activision blizzard grew its share by points over the previous year across all platforms to in the combined us and european market  according to the npd group  charttrack  and gfk 
following the year end  the company announced a new stock repurchase program under which the company can repurchase up to billion of the company s common stock 
the board of directors also declared a cash dividend of per common share payable on april  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  additional business highlights according to the npd group with respect to the us market  charttrack and gfk  for the european market  during the year ended december  call of duty modern warfare was the best selling console title in the us and europe  dj hero was the highest grossing new intellectual property launched in in the us and europe  call of duty and guitar hero were two of the top five best selling franchises across all platforms in the us and europe  we are the us publisher overall for the ps and xbox  and the third party publisher for the wii  and call of duty modern warfare and world of warcraft wrath of the lich king were two of the top five best selling pc titles in dollars in the us and europe 
to date  call of duty modern warfare has sold more than billion in retail sales worldwide  according to the npd group  charttrack  and gfk 
further  at december   there were approximately million gamers worldwide subscribed to play world of warcraft 

table of contents product releases games released during the year ended december  included monsters vs 
aliens  guitar hero  guitar hero metallica  marvel ultimate alliance  x men origins wolverine  bakugan battle brawlers  guitar hero modern hits  dj hero  prototype  band hero  guitar hero smash hits  call of duty modern warfare  transformers revenge of the fallen  tony hawk ride  ice age dawn of the dinosaurs  guitar hero van halen  and wolfenstein  three map packs for call of duty world at war 
in  we expect to continue to build on our success by releasing key franchise games including blizzard s starcraft ii wings of liberty and the world of warcraft expansion pack  cataclysm  as well as a diversified lineup of games based on activision s best selling franchises including call of duty  guitar hero  and tony hawk  together with other well known titles such as true crime  spider man  and bakugan  and a select number of new intellectual property franchises such as blur and singularity 
international operations international sales are a fundamental part of our business 
net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately   and of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we maintain significant operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  germany  france  italy  spain  australia  sweden  south korea  norway  denmark  china  and the netherlands 
we believe that it is important to develop content locally that is specifically directed toward local cultures and customs to succeed internationally 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  foreign currency exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
management s overview of business trends online content and digital downloads we provide a variety of electronically delivered products 
many of our video games that are available through retailers as physical boxed products such as dvds are also available by direct digital download through the internet from websites that we own and others owned by third parties to which we license our products 
we also offer downloadable content and add ons to our products eg  map packs and additional songs 
electronically delivered content is generally offered to consumers for a one time fee 
we continue to focus on and grow our digital download and online revenues and we believe that this will become an increasingly important part of our business over time 
current generation of game consoles the current generation of game consoles began with microsoft s launch of the xbox in  and continued in when sony and nintendo launched their next generation systems  the ps and the wii  respectively 
we have seen a significant decline in ps revenues during as compared to  suggesting that this prior generation platform may soon be completely replaced by the current generation of consoles 
overall console sales remained strong in  with an installed base of hardware in the us and europe of million units as of december   representing an increase of in units year over year 
we will continue to monitor game console sales to manage our product delivery on each platform in a manner we believe to be most effective 

table of contents concentration of top titles a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits 
we expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits 
for example  our top three franchises  call of duty  guitar hero  and world of warcraft  accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december  this is similar to the overall trend in the video game industry 
for example  the top titles accounted for of the sales in the us video game industry in the three months ended december   according to the npd group 
in  we expect to release key franchise games including blizzard s starcraft ii wings of liberty and the world of warcraft expansion pack  cataclysm  as well as a diversified lineup of games based on activision publishing s best selling franchises including call of duty  guitar hero  and tony hawk  together with other well known titles such as true crime  spider man  and bakugan 
also in  we expect to continue to explore new intellectual properties to broaden our franchise portfolio by releasing a select number of new intellectual properties  such as blur and singularity 
seasonality the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal 
we have historically experienced our highest sales volume in the year end holiday buying season  which occurs in the fourth quarter and lowest sales volume in the second quarter of our calendar year 
we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our software titles containing online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable over an extended period of time ie  typically six months to less than a year 
as a result  the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue 
our results can also vary based on a number of factors  including title release dates  consumer demand for our products  and shipment schedules

we provide a discussion and analysis of the operating segments for the years ended december    and in the supplemental pro forma information section below as the pro forma basis provides greater comparability for the activision and distribution segments as 
table of contents the supplemental pro forma information reflects pre business combination businesses previously operated by activision  inc the blizzard segment is not affected by any of the pro forma adjustments 
for better understanding of the differences in presentation between our segment results and the consolidated results  the following explains the nature of each reconciling item 
net effect from deferral of net revenues and related cost of sales we have determined that some of our games online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and as a result a more than inconsequential separate deliverable 
as such  we are required to recognize the revenues of these game titles over the estimated service periods 
the product life may range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year 
the related cost of sales are deferred and recognized to match revenues 
in the table above  we present the amount of net revenues and related cost of sales separately for each period as a result of the accounting treatment 
stock based compensation expense we expense our stock based awards using the grant date fair value over the vesting periods of the stock awards 
in the case of liability awards  the liability is subject to mark to market based on the current stock price 
included within stock based compensation are the net effects of capitalization  deferral  and amortization 
the stock based compensation expenses for each period are presented above 
restructuring we have implemented an organizational restructuring plan as a result of the business combination 
the restructuring activities include severance costs  facility exit costs and balance sheet write downs and exit costs from the cancellation of projects 
we do not expect any material costs relating to this item going forward as we have completed our restructuring activities 
amortization of intangible assets and purchase price accounting related adjustments all of our intangible assets are the result of the business combination and other acquisitions 
we amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of their economic benefits consumption 
the amount presented in the table represents the effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as other purchase price accounting adjustments  where applicable  in our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of intangible assets as a result of the accounting impairment test  we recorded a non cash impairment charge on finite lived intangible assets of million  or loss per share  for the year ended december  reflecting a weaker environment for the casual game and music genres 
integration and transaction costs these costs were incurred to effect the business combination and included activities such as merging systems and streamlining the business processes of the combined company of activision blizzard 
we do not expect any further costs relating to this item going forward as we have completed our integration and transaction activities 

table of contents segment net revenues activision for the year ended december   net revenues from the activision segment increased as compared to primarily due to the following as a result of the consummation of the business combination  net revenues of million from the activision businesses operated by activision  inc for the six months ended june  were included in  but not in  strong performance from new intellectual property launches of dj hero and prototype in  and exceptional performance from call of duty modern warfare these were partially offset by stronger performance of the guitar hero franchise in versus for the year ended december   net revenues from the activision segment increased as compared to primarily due to the consummation of the business combination  which resulted in revenues from activision  inc of approximately  million being included from the date of the business combination  but not in blizzard blizzard s net revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to no new releases in and an interruption of licensing royalties for world of warcraft in china from june to september as a result of a license transfer 
this compared to with the successful november release of the second expansion pack of world of warcraft wrath of the lich king 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in other value added service revenues 
blizzard s net revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to the release of the second expansion pack of world of warcraft wrath of the lich king in november and an increase in the number of world of warcraft subscribers

on a pro forma operating segment basis  our operating margin for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
highlights and analysis of our individual segment net revenues and income from operations are as follows pro forma activision segment net revenues activision s net revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to the prolonged weakness in the economy adversely impacting the casual game and music genres and the stronger performance of the guitar hero franchise in as compared to  and the decline in sales of ps platform titles due to the aging lifecycle of the ps platform as consumers transition to current generation platforms 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net revenues from the exceptional performance of call of duty modern warfare in november and growth in online digital revenues from downloadable content 
activision s net revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to primarily as a result of stronger performance of games related to the guitar hero franchise  higher price points for the guitar hero franchise s hardware bundles  which consisted of drums  guitars and or microphones  as compared to our software only products  and growth in the nintendo wii platform installed base positively impacting wii software titles 
pro forma activision segment income from operations activision s operating income increased for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to exceptional performance of call of duty modern warfare  which was released in november  strong performance from new intellectual property launches of dj hero and prototype in  growth in the higher margin online digital revenues  and lower operating expenses stemming from continuing effective cost containment strategies 
these factors were partially offset by the decrease in net revenues described above 
the increase in activision segment operating income for the year ended december  as compared to was mainly attributable to the increase in net revenues discussed above  partially offset by the higher cost of sales related to the manufacturing and distribution cost of the guitar hero hardware bundle  and the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  as the us dollar strengthened primarily in relation to the british pound  euro and australian dollar

with the continued economic downturn within our industry in and the change in the buying habits of casual consumers  we reassessed our overall expectations 
we considered these economic changes during our planning process conducted during the months of november and december  which resulted in a strategy change to focus on fewer title releases in the casual and music genres 
as a result  we updated our future projected revenue streams for the franchises in the casual games and music genres

under these agreements  we commit to provide specified payments to a lessor  developer or intellectual property holder  as the case may be  based upon contractual arrangements 
the payments to third party developers are generally conditioned upon the achievement by the developers of contractually specified development milestones 
further  these payments to third party developers and intellectual property holders typically are deemed to be advances and are recoupable against future royalties earned by the developer or intellectual property holder based on the sale of the related game

financial disclosure we maintain internal control over financial reporting  which generally includes those controls relating to the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
we also are focused on our disclosure controls and procedures  which as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec are generally those controls and procedures designed to ensure that financial and non financial information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is communicated to management  including our principal executive and financial officers  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
our disclosure committee  which operates under the board approved disclosure committee charter and disclosure controls procedures policy  includes senior management representatives and assists executive management in its oversight of the accuracy and timeliness of our disclosures  as well as in implementing and evaluating our overall disclosure process 
as part of our disclosure process  senior finance and operational representatives from all of our corporate divisions and business units prepare quarterly reports regarding their current quarter operational performance  future trends  subsequent events  internal controls  changes in internal controls and other accounting and disclosure relevant information 
these quarterly reports are reviewed by certain key corporate finance executives 
these corporate finance representatives also conduct quarterly interviews on a rotating basis with the preparers of selected quarterly reports 
the results of the quarterly reports and related interviews are 
table of contents reviewed by the disclosure committee 
finance representatives also conduct reviews with our senior management team  our internal and external counsel and other appropriate personnel involved in the disclosure process  as appropriate 
additionally  senior finance and operational representatives provide internal certifications regarding the accuracy of information they provide that is utilized in the preparation of our periodic public reports filed with the sec 
financial results and other financial information also are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
as required by applicable regulatory requirements  the principal executive and financial officers review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of our periodic public reports filed with the sec  our disclosure controls and procedures  and our internal control over financial reporting 
with the assistance of the disclosure committee  we will continue to assess and monitor  and make refinements to  our disclosure controls and procedures  and our internal control over financial reporting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers  and once any performance obligations have been completed 
certain products are sold to customers with a street date the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers 
for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date 
revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection 
some of our software products provide limited online features at no additional cost to the consumer 
generally  we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable 
accordingly  we recognize revenue related to products containing these limited online features upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customer 
in instances where online features or additional functionality is considered more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product  we take this into account when applying our revenue recognition policy 
this evaluation is performed for each software product and any online transactions  such as electronic downloads of titles with product add ons when it is released 
in instances where the online service is considered more than an inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product  we take this into account when applying our revenue recognition policy 
this evaluation is performed for each software product together with any online transactions  such as electronic downloads of titles or product add ons when it is released 
when we determine that a software title contains online functionality that constitutes a more than inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product  principally because of its importance to game play  we consider that our performance obligations for this title extend beyond the sale of the game 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the online functionality  as we do not separately charge for this component of the title 
as a result  we recognize all of the revenue from the sale of the title ratably over an estimated service period  which is estimated to begin the month after the sale date or the street date of the title  whichever is later 
in addition  we defer the costs of sales for the title 
table of contents excluding intangible asset amortization to match revenues 
cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  software royalties and amortization  and intellectual property licenses 
we recognize world of warcraft boxed product  expansion packs and other value added service revenues each with the related subscription service revenue ratably over the estimated service periods beginning upon activation of the software and delivery of the services 
revenues attributed to the sale of world of warcraft boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as product sales and revenues attributable to subscription and other value added services are classified as subscription  licensing and other revenues 
we currently estimate the service periods over which revenues are recognized range from a minimum of five months to a maximum of less than a year 
determining whether the online service for a particular game constitutes more than an inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires management s judgment 
determining the estimated service periods and product life over which to recognize the revenue and related costs of sales is also subjective and involves management s judgment 
allowances for returns  price protection  doubtful accounts  and inventory obsolescence 
we may permit product returns from  or grant price protection to  our customers under certain conditions 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to decrease the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and  when granted and applicable  allows customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us with respect to open and or future invoices 
the conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or price protection include  among other things  compliance with applicable trading and payment terms  and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell through reports to us 
we may also consider other factors  including the facilitation of slow moving inventory and other market factors 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenue 
we estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenue utilizing historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
the following factors are used to estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for a particular title historical performance of titles in similar genres  historical performance of the hardware platform  historical performance of the franchise  console hardware life cycle  sales force and retail customer feedback  industry pricing  weeks of on hand retail channel inventory  absolute quantity of on hand retail channel inventory  our warehouse on hand inventory levels  the title s recent sell through history if available  marketing trade programs  and competing titles 
the relative importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon  among other items  genre  platform  seasonality  and sales strategy 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period 
based upon historical experience  we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a number of reasons including  among others  a lack of consumer acceptance of a title  the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor  or technological obsolescence due to the emergence of new hardware platforms 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if factors or market conditions change or if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in determining the allowances for returns and price protection 
for example  a change in our december  allowance for returns and price protection would impact net revenues by approximately million 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the age of current outstanding account balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customers payment terms and their economic condition  as well as whether 
table of contents we can obtain sufficient credit insurance 
any significant changes in any of these criteria would affect management s estimates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and in the retail channel 
we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value  based upon assumptions about future demand  which are inherently difficult to assess 
at the point of a loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established basis 
software development costs and intellectual property licenses 
software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements  as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products 
we account for software development costs in accordance with the fasb guidance for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed asc subtopic 
software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable 
technological feasibility of a product encompasses both technical design documentation and game design documentation  or the completed and tested product design and working model 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established 
for products where proven technology exists  this may occur early in the development cycle 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 
prior to a product s release  we expense  as part of cost of sales software royalties and amortization  capitalized costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to product development expense 
commencing upon product release  capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of sales software royalties and amortization based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product  generally resulting in an amortization period of six months or less 
intellectual property license costs represent license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology  music  or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development of our products 
depending upon the agreement with the rights holder  we may obtain the rights to use acquired intellectual property in multiple products over multiple years  or alternatively  for a single product 
prior to the related product s release  we expense  as part of cost of sales intellectual property licenses  capitalized intellectual property costs when we believe such amounts are not recoverable 
capitalized intellectual property costs for those products that are cancelled or abandoned are charged to product development expense in the period of cancellation 
commencing upon the related product s release  capitalized intellectual property license costs are amortized to cost of sales intellectual property licenses based on the ratio of current revenues for the specific product to total projected revenues for all products in which the licensed property will be utilized 
as intellectual property license contracts may extend for multiple years  the amortization of capitalized intellectual property license costs relating to such contracts may extend beyond one year 
we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses on a quarterly basis 
for products that have been released in prior periods  the primary evaluation criterion is actual title performance 
for products that are scheduled to be released in future periods  recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate or in which the licensed trademark or copyright is to be used 
criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include historical performance of comparable 
table of contents products developed with comparable technology  orders for the product prior to its release  and  for any sequel product  estimated performance based on the performance of the product on which the sequel is based 
further  as many of our capitalized intellectual property licenses extend for multiple products over multiple years  we also assess the recoverability of capitalized intellectual property license costs based on certain qualitative factors  such as the success of other products and or entertainment vehicles utilizing the intellectual property  whether there are any future planned theatrical releases or television series based on the intellectual property  and the rights holder s continued promotion and exploitation of the intellectual property 
significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
in evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs  the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred 
if revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the original forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis  the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter  which could result in an impairment charge 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of charges for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates in evaluating these qualitative factors 
income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with fasb income tax guidance asc topic  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of asc topic and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require 
table of contents us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset  liability or equity instrument being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective  and  if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill  which is an asset that is not amortized 
often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset  the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in process technology 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 
assessment of impairment of assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with fasb literature related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets within asc subtopic  which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists 
we considered certain events and circumstances in determining whether the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable including  but not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and changes in our business strategy 
in determining whether an impairment exists  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of these assets 
if an impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million to our finite lived intangible assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the determination of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended december  fasb literature related to the accounting for goodwill and other intangibles within asc topic requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which both discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
asc topic requires that the impairment test be performed at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 

table of contents to determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the value of share based payment awards on the measurement date using a binomial lattice model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies  which amends the evaluation criteria used to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
additionally  this amendment requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
this amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this fasb amendment does not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an update to revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
this update provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in this update also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june  early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this new accounting update on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an update to software certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this update changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality  and excludes these products from the scope of current software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will 
table of contents include factors to help companies determine which software elements are considered essential to the functionality 
the amendments will now subject software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements  such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june  early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this new accounting update on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an update to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provides amendments to asc subtopic requiring new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of levels and  in which the company should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  in which the company should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
in addition the update provides clarification of existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchase  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this new accounting update on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities and money market funds that invest in such securities 
as short term securities mature relatively quickly and must be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of cash  cash equivalents  or short term securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
conversely  the fair value of such a portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities 
at december   our  million of cash and cash equivalents were comprised primarily of money market funds 
at december   our million of short term investments included million of us government agency securities  million of mortgage backed securities  million of auction rate securities classified as trading  and million of restricted cash 
we had million in auction rate securities at fair value classified as long term investments at december  most of our investment portfolio is invested in short term or variable rate securities 
accordingly  we believe that a sharp change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our short term investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in many different foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
currency volatility is monitored frequently throughout the year
