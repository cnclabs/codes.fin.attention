concurrent with the precision acquisition  we issued million of senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  and are subject to customary anti dilution adjustment terms for these types of notes 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to fund the acquisition of precision and for general corporate purposes 
precision  based in eau claire  wisconsin  is a leading energy infrastructure services provider  specializing in the construction and maintenance of large diameter pipelines 
precision s experience in the long haul  interstate pipeline industry complements our existing energy infrastructure service offerings  which include natural gas gathering systems  processing plants and compression stations and mid stream pipelines 
we believe that our acquisition of precision enhances our end to end design and construction capabilities within the energy industry 
with the acquisition of precision  we become one of the leading pipeline contractors in the country  capable of providing a full array of construction services to oil and gas producers  as well as mid stream and interstate pipeline operators 
industry trends our industry is composed of national  regional and local companies that provide outsourced infrastructure services to customers in the utilities and communications industries as well as to government customers 
we believe the following industry trends impact demand for our services stimulus act 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the stimulus act  signed on february   should have a positive impact on our customer spending in a number of important areas  plus offer additional incentives that should benefit our business 
the stimulus act extends the federal tax incentives applicable to the wind energy industry  specifically the production tax credit for wind projects placed into service before  and allows wind projects to claim the investment tax credit equal to of the cost of certain qualifying assets that may be elected in lieu of claiming the production tax credit 
the production tax credit provides the owner of a us wind facility consisting primarily of the pad  tower and turbine with a ten year credit against its federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity produced at such facility by the owner and sold to unrelated persons during that period 
the stimulus act also includes a us treasury grant program which allows taxpayers that own production tax credit eligible and investment tax credit eligible facilities to receive grants from the us treasury equal to the amount of the investment tax credit that would otherwise be available to the facility 
the accelerated depreciation provisions for wind generation assets provides for a five year depreciable life for these assets  rather than the to year depreciable lives of many non renewable energy assets 
in addition  historically these incentives have increased the construction activity in this sector and are expected to do so in the future 
the stimulus act also contains several provisions aimed at improving the us s electrical transmission system in part to facilitate the transfer of renewable energy from rural areas to high demand areas  including at least billion in funds for renewable energy and transmission loan guarantees  which are expected to facilitate more than billion in loans for these projects 
the stimulus act also provides for billion in funds for the development of broadband facilities throughout the united states 
while we believe the stimulus act will provide opportunities in the industries we serve  we are uncertain as to when  or if  the governmental stimulus initiatives will begin to have a noticeable impact on the industries we serve 
we do  however  anticipate increased capital spending on infrastructure in the future 

table of contents renewable energy projects 
the desire to decrease the country s dependence on foreign oil imports and the focus on a clean environment have created demand for more domestic  environmentally sensitive electrical power production such as wind and solar collection farms 
according to the american wind energy association  as of december   the united states had approximately  megawatts of installed wind farm generating capacity  with approximately  megawatts added in there are approximately  megawatts currently under construction 
according to the federal energy regulatory commission s ferc market oversight report from december  states in the united states and the district of columbia have already adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals  which standards require or target that certain specified percentages of energy sales or installed capacity come from renewable sources such as wind  solar  geothermal or biofuel 
in its long term reliability assessment  north american electric reliability corporation  or nerc  the organization of us electric grid operators  projects approximately  megawatts of new renewable capacity over the coming ten years  with percent of this comprised of wind 
as a result of these trends  emerging energy research  or eer  forecasted that more than billion will be invested in additional wind energy capacity in the united states through the stimulus act  which calls for expansion of domestic renewable energy sources through tax incentives and loan guarantees  should also provide our wind farm business with the potential for sustained growth 
wind power generation is only feasible where adequate average wind speed and consistency are present 
the principal onshore wind resource in the united states is located in the central plains area of the country  roughly from the texas panhandle to the canadian border 
this wind corridor is a relatively remote area where population density and industrial energy demand are relatively low 
as a result  often few traditionally fueled generation facilities exist in these areas and extensive collection and transmission projects are also necessary to connect these renewable energy generation projects to the electrical grid 
we believe that demand for new domestic sources of clean power generation and the related substations and transmission lines necessary to connect them to the electrical grid will provide significant growth prospects for the foreseeable future 
the new generation of wind turbines can produce electrical power at more competitive rates 
currently  approximately of the united states electrical needs are met by wind power generation 
a july report by the us department of energy  however  presents a roadmap for increasing wind power generation to of demand by  which would require hundreds of billions of dollars in new wind farm investment and transmission lines 
in july  the department of energy  or doe  announced the selection of new wind energy projects for up to million in funding  including million in stimulus act funds 
these projects will help address market and deployment challenges  including wind turbine research  testing and transmission analysis  planning and assessments 
the doe s wind technologies market report detailed billion in investment in wind projects made in the u 
s in  making the us the leader in annual wind energy capacity growth  as well as cumulative wind energy capacity 
we also believe that us energy policy goals will continue to promote domestic sources of energy in order to reduce u 
s dependence on foreign energy sources 
with recent developments in drilling and completion technologies for oil and gas  we expect new north american producing fields to be developed and old fields to be expanded significantly 
according to ferc s long term reliability assessment  by  natural gas is projected to overtake coal as the dominant fuel source for peak capacity generation in north america 
we anticipate the resulting incremental production will provide continuing construction opportunities as oil and gas producers and pipeline operators move oil  gas and refined products to markets via pipelines  providing us with robust pipeline and related construction opportunities 
as evidence of this expected growth  as of october   ferc had over  miles of pending major pipeline projects on file 
with the acquisition of precision  combined with our historical gas gathering system business and the recent acquisitions of pumpco  inc specializing in mid stream natural gas pipeline and wanzek specializing in wind  solar and natural gas compression and industrial plant construction  we expect to be a leading player in both renewable energy and gas  crude oil and crude oil products transmission pipeline infrastructure 
inadequacy of existing electric power transmission and distribution networks 
the united states electric transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance  upgrades and extensions to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures 
according to a november report published by the edison electric institute  or eei  the projected investment in new transmission systems from to is billion and billion for the period to additionally  new renewable energy generation projects  including wind and solar collection farms  are typically located in remote areas  consequently significant investment in new transmission lines will be required to connect this power to the electrical grid and to transport this power to more populated or industrial areas with higher demand 
for example  in july  the texas public utility commission  or puc  approved the investment of approximately billion for the construction of electric transmission lines to carry power generated by new wind farms in remote western and northern parts of state to major population and industrial centers in texas 
in  the puc issued the order for construction of these transmission lines 

table of contents while the electrical grid reliability continues to deteriorate  demand for electricity is expected to continue to grow as the economy recovers 
according to the annual energy outlook published by the us doe s energy information administration  or eia  the population of the united states will increase by about from to  with energy consumption increasing by a corresponding 
additionally  the same eia report projects that total us electricity consumption will increase by approximately from  billion kilowatt hours in to  billion kilowatt hours in nerc reports in its long term reliability assessment that peak demand for electricity in the us  which typically occurs in the summer  is forecast to increase by over the next ten years 
the stimulus act allocates billion in funds for modernization and expansion of the nation s electrical grid in order to develop a smart grid 
based on their long term reliability assessment  nerc projects the number of transmission miles will increase  circuit miles in the us over the next ten years 
we believe spending levels will continue to increase as utilities work to address infrastructure maintenance requirements  as well as the future reliability standards required by the energy policy act of  or the energy act 
increased production and demand for natural gas 
natural gas is one of the cleanest burning hydrocarbon fuels and is in demand due to its relative cost advantage over other fossil fuel sources 
the level of natural gas pipeline construction activity in the united states is expected to increase 
according to a report published in october by the interstate national gas association approximately   miles of us pipeline projects are expected through we believe that as new unconventional shale gas reserves are developed  the demand for additional gas transport projects will grow 
demand for increased wireless and wired voice  video and data services 
demand for faster and more robust voice  video and data services has increased significantly with the proliferation of the internet  broadband  video and music download services  high definition television and other advanced video services 
to serve this developing market and the ever increasing need for more bandwidth  voice  video and data for fixed and mobile devices  service providers are upgrading the performance of their wired and wireless networks or deploying new competing networks using new technologies such as worldwide interoperability for microwave access  or wimax 
investment is facilitated by declining equipment costs and expanded capabilities of wireline and wireless network equipment 
at the same time  major regional and rural telecommunication companies are upgrading their networks from copper line to fiber optic line in order to enhance their ability to provide customers with bundled services that include video  voice and data 
similar dynamics of providers seeking to improve their offerings are prevalent in the cable and satellite markets as well 
the stimulus act allocates billion for the development of broadband facilities throughout the us and the expansion of broadband access into areas that are currently not served by high speed data networks 
competitive strengths our competitive strengths include diverse customer relationships 
we serve a diversified customer and industry base

suppliers  materials and working capital under many of our contracts  our customers supply the necessary materials and supplies and we are responsible for installation  but not for material costs or material warranties 
under certain of our contracts we acquire materials and supplies for our own account from third party providers 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for materials or supplies and have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of materials and supplies 
we utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage work flow 
our independent contractors are typically sole proprietorships or small business entities that provide their own vehicles  tools and insurance coverage 
we are not dependent on any single independent contractor 
see item a 
risk factors we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying  us for the related services 
we need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business  primarily due to the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work  including storm restoration work  and the corresponding spending by our customers on their annual capital expenditure budgets 
our business is typically slower in the first quarter of each calendar year 
we generally experience seasonal working capital needs from approximately april through december to support growth in unbilled revenue and accounts receivable  and to a lesser extent  inventory 
our billing terms are generally net to days  although some contracts allow our customers to retain a portion from to of the contract amount until the contract is completed 
we maintain inventory to meet the material requirements of some of our contracts 
some of our customers pay us in advance for a portion of the materials we purchase for their projects  or allow us to pre bill them for materials purchases up to a specified amount 
our vendors generally offer us terms ranging from to days 
our agreements with subcontractors often contain a pay when paid provision  whereby our payments to subcontractors are made only after we are paid by our customers 
competition our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
we often compete with a number of companies in markets where we operate  ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms 
the national or large regional firms that compete with us include quanta services  inc  pike electric  inc  bechtel corporation  ma mortenson company  dh blattner sons  inc  and dycom industries  inc 
table of contents relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
some of our customers employ personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide 
we compete based upon our industry experience  technical expertise  financial and operational resources  nationwide presence  industry reputation and customer service 
while we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider  most of their work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected 
see item a 
risk factors our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
regulation and environmental matters we are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally  including laws and regulations related to labor relations  worker safety and environmental protection 
while many of our customers operate in regulated industries for example  utilities regulated by the public service commission or broadband companies regulated by franchise agreements with various municipalities  we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight 
as a contractor  our operations are subject to various laws  including regulations related to vehicle registrations  including those of state and the united states departments of transportation  regulations related to worker safety and health  including those established by the occupational safety and health administration  contractor licensing requirements  building and electrical codes  and permitting and inspection requirements 
we are also subject to numerous environmental laws governing our operations  including the handling  transportation and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes  as well as emissions and discharges into the environment  including discharges into air  surface water and groundwater and soil 
we also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
under certain of these laws and regulations  such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties  regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal 
the presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business 
in addition  we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations 
for example  some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations in certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
see item a 
risk factors our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
we believe we have all licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in compliance with all material applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if we fail to comply with any material applicable regulatory requirements  we could incur significant liabilities

given the recent financial market turmoil and tightening of credit  our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure  or may have difficulty in obtaining financing  which has resulted  and may continue to result  in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date 
such cancellations or deferrals have resulted  and could continue to result  in decreased demand for our services and could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
in addition  our customers are affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services 
slow downs in real estate  fluctuations in commodity prices and decreased demand by end customers for higher value services could affect our customers and their capital expenditure plans 
because we have been negatively impacted by previous economic downturns  we constantly monitor our customers industries and their relative health compared to the economy as a whole 
the reduction in new housing starts  for example  could negatively impact our customers who utilize our services to construct their last mile of communications infrastructure  as well as other industries we serve  including electric utility transmission and grid connection  water and sewer and natural gas pipeline construction 
additionally  our customers who provide satellite and broadband communications to consumers across the country could be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are not ordered at the rate that we and our customers anticipate 
during an economic downturn  like the current economic downturn  our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure at their current levels or may determine to outsource less work 
a decrease in any of these projects  new subscriptions and upgrades or any other services we provide could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change  and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demand for our services 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the communications and utilities industries 
the communications and utilities industries are subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation 
changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide 
for example  new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for the transmission of voice  video and data  and improvements in existing technology may allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
technological advances may also result in lower costs for sources of energy  which may render existing wind energy  solar energy and natural gas projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  both the communications and utilities industries have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers 
our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries we serve or the consolidation of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our industry is highly competitive  which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our industry is highly fragmented  and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate  ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets 
we also face competition from existing or prospective customers that employ in house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors 

table of contents most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
if we are unsuccessful in bidding on these projects  or if our ability to win such projects requires that we accept lesser margins  then our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers  and the loss of one of these customers or a reduction in their demand for our services could impair our financial performance 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t and enbridge  respectively 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t and verizon  respectively 
in addition  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers  and certain of our services are provided on a non recurring  project by project basis  we could experience a reduction in our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity if we lose one or more of these customers or the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced  or if we complete the required work on our projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 
in addition  all of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or no notice 
our profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers are unable to pay for our services 
in the past  we incurred significant losses after a number of customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn and certain industry specific factors that worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers 
in  and total provisions for bad debts aggregated to million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  resulted from anticipated legal settlements for customers in bankruptcy and discontinued operations 
as of december   we had remaining receivables from customers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling million  of which million is included in specific reserves for bad debts  with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered through secured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds 
most of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
under our multi year master service agreements and other service agreements  we contract to provide customers with individual project services  through work orders  within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis 
under these agreements  our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we have recorded unrealized losses to reduce the carrying value of certain auction rate securities we hold  and we may incur additional impairment charges with respect to auction rate securities in future periods 
the current overall credit concerns in capital markets may affect our ability to liquidate certain auction rate securities that we classify as securities available for sale on our balance sheet 
our securities available for sale consist of auction rate securities which represent interests in pools of student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and structured finance securities 
these structured finance securities are collateralized by investment grade credit linked notes made up of floating rate international bank notes or credit card receivable notes that collateralize credit default swap agreements on corporate debt obligations 
as of december   all of our securities available for sale  with a par value of million and a fair value of million  had insufficient bidders at the scheduled rollover dates 
during  all of our structured finance auction rate securities  with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million  were downgraded to non investment grade by standard poor s and fitch 
if there were events of default on the underlying portfolio of the credit default swaps that exceeded the stated net default rates  which range from to  we could suffer a loss on some or all of the principal value of these corporate debt obligation auction rate securities 
as of december   we have aggregate unrealized losses on these securities of million 
of the million  million relates to our structured finance auction rate securities 
due to deterioration in the credit quality of these structured finance securities in  we deemed the 
table of contents decline in value for these securities to be an other than temporary impairment  and accordingly  recorded a charge of million in earnings as an other than temporary impairment in our valuation is sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
at this time  we are uncertain whether the liquidity issues associated with these investments will improve  when we will be able to exit these investments at their cost basis or whether we will incur additional temporary or other than temporary losses as a result of these investments 
as a result of this uncertainty  the million fair value of these securities is classified as long term assets at december  in october  we settled our claim against the investment advisor that sold us the auction rate securities 
the investment advisor paid us a one time payment and we retained the auction rate securities 
in connection with the settlement  we released the investment advisor from any liability or claims of any kind related to the auction rate securities 
accordingly  if we are unable to sell our auction rate securities at par in the future  we will have no recourse against the investment advisor 
most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice  so our revenue is not guaranteed 
most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice  ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon days notice  even if we are not in default under the contract 
many of our contracts  including our service agreements  are periodically open to public bid 
we may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re bid 
we also provide a significant portion of our services on a non recurring  project by project basis 
we could experience a reduction in our revenue  profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 
we may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed price contracts which could impair our financial performance 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and other service agreements that are fixed price contracts 
under these contracts  we set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated 
in addition to master or other service agreements  we enter into contracts that require installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system 
under those agreements  we have also contractually agreed to a price per unit 
profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any expected losses on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such units 
our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as lower than anticipated productivity  conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those originally estimated  and as a result  certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated  or losses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates  which could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
our failure to properly manage projects  or project delays  may result in additional costs or claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
certain of our engagements involve large scale  complex projects 
the quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources  including third party contractors and our own personnel 
our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees  or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones 
additionally  delays on a particular project  including permitting delays  may cause us to incur costs for standby pay  and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date 
in addition  some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines  therefore  any failure to properly estimate or manage cost  or delay in the completion of projects could subject us to penalties which could further adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
further  any defects or errors  or failures to meet our customers 
table of contents expectations could result in large damage claims against us  and because of the substantial cost of  and potentially long lead time necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects  particularly our wind farm and pipeline projects  damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services 
we recognize revenue for our installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  therefore  variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability 
we recognize revenue on long term installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs 
the percentage of completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material 
we immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our liquidity 
for example  for the years ended december   and  we incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  of losses on percentage of completion contracts 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits  and our backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and therefore is an uncertain indicator of future operating results 
approximately of our month backlog at december  was composed of master service agreements and other service agreements  none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
the balance of our backlog is our estimate of work to be completed on long term installation construction fixed price agreements 
these backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period  or at all 
in addition  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  other project deferrals or delays  scope adjustments  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
if our backlog fails to materialize  our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity would be materially and adversely affected 
accordingly  our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings 
our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the year 
adverse weather conditions  particularly during the winter season  also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the united states 
as a result  we experience reduced revenue in the first quarter of each calendar year 
natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in the united states could also have a negative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions  which could result in a decline in results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
warranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we generally warrant the work we perform for a one to two year period following substantial completion of a project  subject to further extensions of the warranty period following repairs or replacements 
we have not historically accrued any reserves for potential warranty claims as they have been immaterial 
the costs associated with such warranties  including any warranty related legal proceedings  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  those policies are subject to high deductibles  and we are self insured up to the amount of the deductible 
since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but 
table of contents not reported losses  and reflect the present value of those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities  we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity 
increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability  liquidity and availability under our credit facility 
because of factors such as increases in claims  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
an increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availability under our revolving credit facility 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings  and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility 
some of our contracts require performance and payment bonds 
we may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain customers 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future  we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds which would reduce availability under our credit facility 
the impact of the stimulus act is uncertain 
the lack of available capital and the illiquidity in the debt and capital markets  coupled with the economic downturn resulted in a tremendous amount of uncertainty with numerous renewable energy projects being delayed or canceled 
while we believe that the stimulus act  which was enacted into law in february  should aid the wind  electrical transmission and rural broadband businesses  we did not receive any stimulus act related revenue in and the extent to which it will result in future revenues is uncertain 
we cannot predict when programs under the stimulus act will be implemented or the timing and scope of any investments to be made under these programs 
investments for renewable energy  electric power infrastructure rural broadband facilities under stimulus act programs may not occur  may be less than anticipated or may be delayed  which would negatively impact demand for our services 
additionally  the tax incentives provided by the stimulus act have a finite duration 
currently  the election to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit is only available for qualified wind facilities placed in service from to december   the us treasury grant program will only be applicable to wind projects placed in service in or or after so long as construction begins in or and is completed before  and the production tax credit is scheduled to expire on december  and will not be available for energy generated from wind facilities placed in service after that date unless the credit program is extended or renewed 
whether the new investment tax credit or us treasury grant program will be effective for wind projects or renewable projects in uncertain  as are any future efforts to extend or renew the production tax credit  the investment tax credit  and or the us treasury grant program 
furthermore  the provisions regarding any extension or renewal may not be as favorable as those that currently exist 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any extension or renewal of the production tax credit  the investment tax credit  and or the us treasury grant program would be enacted prior to its expiration or  if allowed to expire  that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect 
we also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated depreciation of wind generation assets will not be modified  amended or repealed in the future 
if the investment tax credit or the us treasury grant program are not effective or if the federal production tax credit is not extended or renewed  or is extended or renewed at a lower rate  the ability of our customers to obtain financing for these wind farm developments may be impaired or eliminated  and the resulting wind farms would be less profitable  thereby potentially reducing demand for our wind power services 
our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if demand for our wind power services or the tax incentives were reduced 
legislative actions and incentives relating to electric power and renewable energy may fail to result in increased demand for our services 
while we believe the energy act will provide opportunities in the industries we serve  implementation of the energy act is still subject to considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty 
regulations implementing the components of the energy act that may affect 
table of contents demand for our services remain in some cases subject to review in various federal courts 
in one such case  decided in february  a federal court of appeals vacated ferc s interpretation of the scope of its backstop siting authority 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  is uncertain 
as a result  the legislation may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure 
continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the energy act may result in slower growth in demand for our services 
in addition  changes to energy regulatory policy may be forthcoming due to the new administration 
changes to renewable portfolio standards could  and decreased demand for renewable energy projects would  negatively impact our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
a significant portion of our business is currently focused on providing construction and or installation services to owners and operators of wind power facilities 
the development of wind facilities is highly dependent upon the federal production tax credit discussed above and the existence of renewable portfolio standards and other state incentives 
renewable portfolio standards are state specific statutory provisions requiring that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of its operational development capacity to renewable energy sources 
additionally  certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every unit of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to supply companies 
these standards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our wind power related services 
currently  more the half of the states in the united states as well as the district of columbia have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals 
eliminations of or changes to existing renewable portfolio standards or similar environmental policies may impact the demand for our wind and solar power related services 
additionally  renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup 
the locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable unless connectivity to the grid to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible 
furthermore  funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available  which may be further constrained as a result of turbulent credit markets 
these factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated or a delay in the timing of construction of these projects and the related infrastructure  which would negatively affect the demand for our services 
demand for pipeline construction services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices and the cost of energy infrastructure projects 
demand for our pipeline construction services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development  and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
low prices for oil and natural gas generally depress levels of exploration  development  and production activity  resulting in a corresponding decline in the demand for pipeline construction services 
factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas  especially demand for natural gas in the united states  governmental regulations  including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves  as well as environmental laws and initiatives to control global warming  global weather conditions and natural disasters  worldwide political  military  and economic conditions  the level of oil production by non opec countries and the available excess production capacity within opec  oil refining capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas  and the cost of producing and delivering oil and gas  potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 
spending on exploration and production activities by large oil and gas companies has a significant impact on the activity levels of pipeline construction services 

table of contents in addition  demand for pipeline construction services may be affected by the costs of energy exploration and constructing energy infrastructure projects 
for example  while high oil and gas prices may increase oil and gas exploration  production and transportation activity  high demand for equipment  materials and labor required for such projects may increase the costs of such projects and dampen demand 
furthermore  increased costs for raw materials such as steel and other commodities may make some projects uneconomical despite robust oil and gas prices  thus reducing demand for our pipeline construction services 
a decrease in demand for our pipeline construction services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state department of transportation related projects and assets that were sold in february effective february   we sold our state department of transportation related projects and assets 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of our state department of transportation projects and assets to settle previously disclosed warranty  indemnification and other claims primarily relating to work we had performed on the state department of transportation projects we sold 
in connection with the settlement agreement  the parties also agreed to further amend and restate the amended asset purchase agreement effective as of january   which we refer to as the revised amended agreement 
in connection with the sale of our state department of transportation related projects and assets and the related settlement  we agreed to keep certain liabilities  mainly related to the cost to maintain and continue certain performance and payment bonds  certain obligations under leases between the parties and certain other litigation matters 
we may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result of any third party claims to the extent any third parties seek payment from us directly and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations contained in the revised amended agreement  including any losses resulting from creditor claims  in the event the buyer was financially unable to meet certain obligations 
under the terms of the revised amended agreement  the buyer is no longer required to issue a standby letter of credit in our favor to cover any remaining exposure related to our bonded obligations 
instead  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the buyer entered into indemnity agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in connection with our bonded obligations 
therefore  if the buyer is unable to meet its contractual obligations  the surety bonding company can seek its remedies under the indemnity agreement 
if the surety bonding company  however  pays the amounts due under the bonds  the surety bonding company will seek reimbursement of such payment from us 
accordingly  we may incur losses in the future related to these contingent liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in the revised amended agreement 
the buyer of the department of transportation related projects and assets filed for bankruptcy protection in october  which increases the likelihood that we will be required to assume certain obligations associated with these projects 
at december   we estimated that the remaining cost to complete these state department of transportation projects was million on the related million in performance and payment bonds 
should actual costs to complete exceed estimates  we could incur future losses which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our reporting entities may incur goodwill impairment charges which could harm our profitability 
when we acquire a business  we record goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including anticipated future liabilities and liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of that business 
as a result of acquisitions  we have million and million of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets recorded as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to record additions to goodwill in future periods in connection with completed acquisitions  particularly as a result of future earn out payments for acquisitions completed prior to december   or from any future acquisitions 
we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed their fair market values 
in connection with our decision to sell substantially all our canadian net assets  we wrote off goodwill associated with this entity in the amount of million for the year ended december  we may incur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in connection with any of our acquisitions in the future if the markets they serve or their businesses deteriorate 
we may incur restructuring or impairment charges  which could reduce our profitability 
from time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability 
we could incur charges in the future as a result of eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy  reducing or eliminating services or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin  
table of contents reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements  and reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources 
for example  as a result of the sale of our state department of transportation operations  we recorded impairment charges totaling million for the year ended december  all charges related to restructuring or impairment would be reflected as operating expenses and could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity 
our revolving credit facility  senior notes and senior convertible notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
at december   we had million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our senior notes due and our senior convertible notes due we also have a revolving credit facility with no outstanding balance at december  at december   availability was approximately million  net of outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating million 
the terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders 
the prohibited actions include  among other things buying back shares in excess of specified amounts  making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts  paying cash dividends  creating certain liens against our assets  prepaying subordinated indebtedness  engaging in certain mergers or combinations  and engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control as defined in the credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes 
additionally  certain provisions of our convertible notes could make it more expensive for a third party to acquire us or require us to repurchase the convertible notes for cash when required by the holders  including following a fundamental change as defined in the indenture 
our credit facility requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business 
a default could also result in the acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility  or under the indenture relating to the senior notes and the indenture relating to our convertible notes 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
our business is capital intensive and  to the extent we need additional financing  we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms  which may materially decrease our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently  which could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our business is labor intensive  and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover 
in addition  given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform  many of our employees are trained in and possess specialized technical skills 
at times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve  it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilled labor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills 
additionally  our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management 
labor shortages  increased labor or training costs  or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents certain of our businesses have employees who are represented by a union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements  the unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our operations 
certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements 
although all of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future despite the terms of these agreements 
strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
additionally  as current agreements expire  the labor unions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members  or at all  or avoid strikes  lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members 
therefore  it cannot be assured that new agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire or on terms that we find desirable 
any labor action against us relating to failure to reach an agreement with employee labor unions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations our participation in multi employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
substantially all of our union and collective bargaining agreements require us to participate with other companies in multi employer pension plans 
to the extent that those plans are underfunded  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of  may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated 
furthermore  the pension protection act of added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after for multi employer plans that are classified as endangered  seriously endangered  or critical status 
for a plan in critical status  benefit reductions may apply and or we may be required to make additional contributions if a plan is determined to be underfunded  which could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins 
the price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by the opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing 
accordingly  any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity 
our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties  or we may be unable to maintain these relationships  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we depend on subcontractors to complete some of the work on some of our projects 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract 
in addition  if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies and or perform the agreed upon services  then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized 
in addition  the absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts 
any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying us for the related services 
we use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow 
in some cases  we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services 
if we choose  or are required  to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay  or delay paying us for the related work  we could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity 

table of contents our business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments  which could cause delays and result in additional costs 
we perform work under a variety of conditions  including  but not limited to  difficult and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions 
performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations  potentially causing us to incur additional  unanticipated costs  reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages 
in addition  some of our contracts require that we assume the risk that actual site conditions vary from those expected 
some of our projects involve challenging engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  sometimes over several years 
we may encounter difficulties in engineering  delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party  equipment and material delivery  schedule changes  delays from customer failure to timely obtain rights of way  weather related delays  delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  but which impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule 
in some cases  delays and additional costs may be substantial  and we may be required to cancel a project and or compensate the customer for the delay 
we may not be able to recover any of such costs 
any such delays or cancellations  defects or errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project  as well as negatively impact our reputation or relationships with customers  adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material negative impact our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occupational safety and health act of  as amended  or osha  establishes certain employer responsibilities  including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury  compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration and various record keeping  disclosure and procedural requirements 
various standards  including standards for notices of hazards and safety in excavation and demolition work may apply to our operations 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations  and could incur penalties and fines in the future  including in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk  and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what are believed to be appropriate precautions  we have suffered employee injuries and fatalities in the past and may suffer additional injuries or fatalities in the future 
serious accidents of this nature may subject us to substantial penalties  civil litigation or criminal prosecution 
personal injury claims for damages  including for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs and liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate  or if we suffered substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations  customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us  which could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents we have  from time to time  received notice from the us department of transportation that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges 
if we were not able to successfully resolve these issues  our ability to service our customers could be damaged  which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our financial results are based  in part  upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued self insured claims  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  including amortization of intangibles  the fair value of securities available for sale and accounting for performance based stock awards  income taxes including net deferred tax assets and other contingencies  including litigation matters 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition 
construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines  pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials  heavy equipment  mechanical failures  transportation accidents  adverse weather conditions and damage to equipment and property 
these hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims which could  in some cases  substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services 
in addition  if serious accidents or fatalities occur  or our safety records were to deteriorate  we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining other new contracts and certain existing contracts could be terminated 
our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus 
see risk factors our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities  employee turnover  increase the costs of our projects  or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers  which could materially reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances  and our properties may have environmental contamination  which could result in material liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
certain of our current and historical construction operations have used hazardous materials and  to the extent that such materials are not properly stored  contained or recycled  they could become hazardous waste 
additionally  some of our contracts require that we assume the environmental risk of site conditions and require that we indemnify our customers for any damages  including environmental damages  incurred in connection with our projects 
we may be subject to claims under various environmental laws and regulations federal and state statutes and or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages  as well as for natural resource damages and the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  groundwater  and other media under laws such as cercla 
such claims may arise  for example  out of current or former conditions at project sites  current or former properties owned or leased by us  and contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties 
liability may be imposed without regard to fault and may be strict  joint and several  such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination or other damages  or even for the entire share  and may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties causing the contamination 

table of contents many of our customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and the profitability of those services 
many of our communications customers are regulated by the federal communications commission  or fcc  and our energy customers are regulated by ferc  and  in addition  our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions 
these agencies may interpret the application of their regulations in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations 
if existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide  then demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced 
claims  lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  consequential damages  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  pursuant to our service agreements  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide 
claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs 
when appropriate  we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to case developments 
if our reserves are inadequate  or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable  or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity 
an adverse determination on any such claim  lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
we have made  and in the future may continue to make strategic acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of precision 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of our lenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions 
we may pay for acquisitions with our common stock or with convertible securities  which may dilute your investment in our common stock  or we may decide to pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree with 
in connection with most of our acquisitions  we have also agreed to substantial earn out arrangements 
to the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn out arrangement  it will reduce our cash flows in subsequent periods 
in addition  acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business  increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions  or unforeseen internal difficulties  the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs  diversion of management s attention  and the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations 
in addition  acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed  or were unable  to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations 
we cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties that we assume upon consummation of an acquisition 
we may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that materially adversely affect us  such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws 
any such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with  or resulting from  acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
borrowings or issuances of convertible securities associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms 

table of contents our inability to enforce non competition agreements with former principals and key management of the businesses we acquire may adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
in connection with our acquisitions  we generally require that key management and the former principals of the businesses we acquire enter into non competition agreements in our favor 
the laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of non competition agreements 
generally  state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a non competition agreement  consequently  we cannot predict with certainty whether  if challenged  a court will enforce any particular non competition agreement 
if one or more former principals or members of key management of the businesses we acquire leave and the courts refuse to enforce the non compete agreement entered into by such person or persons  we might be subject to increased competition  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
risks related to our company and our common stock we have a significant amount of debt 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
we have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt 
this level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations  an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements  which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  including borrowings under our credit facility  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industry in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital  and some of these activities may on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive 
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during the three years ended december   our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
we may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock  including announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors  
table of contents future sales of our common stock or other securities  including any shares issued in connection with earn out obligations for any past or future acquisition  announcements by us or one of our competitors of new or terminated customers or new  amended or terminated contracts  market conditions for providers of services to communications companies  utilities and government  conversions or anticipated conversions of our senior convertible notes  or any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years  which have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile  and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock 
there may be future sales or other dilution of our equity  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in connection with certain completed acquisitions  we have issued shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock  and in addition  we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash as consideration for future earn out obligations 
we may agree to issue additional securities in connection with other future acquisitions  which  if issued  would dilute your share ownership and could lead to volatility in our common stock price 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
in connection with certain completed acquisitions  we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash for certain earn out obligations  provided we first register those shares for resale  including one such obligation for which our earn out obligation is unlimited 
such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we may issue up to a total  shares of common stock  of which  shares were outstanding as of december  we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock  including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock 
we issued million of senior convertible notes in june  the proceeds of which were partially used to redeem at par the million convertible notes issued in connection with the wanzek acquisition in december in connection with the acquisition of precision  we issued million of senior convertible notes in november the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes  in connection with future acquisitions or other issuances of our common stock or convertible securities  including outstanding options and warrants  or otherwise will dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity linked securities 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity related securities would have on the market price of our common stock 
a small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions 
jorge mas  our chairman  jose mas  our chief executive officer and other members of the mas family who are employed by mastec  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  accordingly  they are in a position to influence the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the nomination of individuals to our board of directors  and a change in our control 
these factors may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock 

table of contents our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of florida law contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws and the florida business corporation act  or the fbca  could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of holders of our common stock  including the granting of voting control to others  which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control
