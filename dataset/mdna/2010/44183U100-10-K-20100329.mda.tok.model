item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general houston american energy was incorporated in april for the purposes of seeking oil and gas exploration and development prospects 
since inception  we have sought out prospects utilizing the expertise and business contacts of john f 
terwilliger  our founder and principal executive officer 
through the third quarter of  the acquisition targets were in the gulf coast region of texas and louisiana  where mr 
terwilliger has been involved in oil and gas exploration for over years 
since the fourth quarter of  we have expanded our focus to include oil and gas exploration in colombia more fully described below 
domestically and internationally  the strategy is to be a non operating partner with exploration and production companies that have much larger resources and operations 
overview of operations our operations are exclusively devoted to natural gas and oil exploration and production 
our focus  to date and for the foreseeable future  is the identification of oil and gas drilling prospects and participation in the drilling and production of prospects 
we typically identify prospects and assemble various drilling partners to participate in  and fund  drilling activities 
we may retain an interest in a prospect for our services in identifying and assembling prospects without any contribution on our part to drilling and completion costs or we may contribute to drilling and completion costs based on our proportionate interest in a prospect 
we derive our revenues from our interests in oil and gas production sold from prospects in which we own an interest  whether through royalty interests  working interest or other arrangements 
our revenues vary directly based on a combination of production volumes from wells in which we own an interest  market prices of oil and natural gas sold and our percentage interest in each prospect 
our well operating expenses vary depending upon the nature of our interest in each prospect 
we may bear no interest or a proportionate interest in the costs of drilling  completing and operating prospects on which we own an interest 
other than well drilling  completion and operating expenses  our principal operating expenses relate to our efforts to identify and secure prospects  comply with our various reporting obligations as a publicly held company and general overhead expenses 
recent developments production levels  commodity prices and revenues our production levels and revenues during  as compared to  were affected by the sale of our caracara prospect in and the sharp decline in oil and natural gas prices that began during the second half of and continued through the third quarter of as a result of depressed commodity prices  our operator in colombia temporarily shut in production from a majority of our colombian properties and we had no sales in colombia from february  through april  during  the caracara prospect accounted for approximately  barrels of oil net to the company produced  or of our oil production  and  of revenues

colombian farm outs and participations 
in june  we entered into a farmout agreement with shona energy limited pursuant to which we will pay of designated phase geological and seismic costs relating to the serrania contract for exploration and production relating to the approximately  acre serrania block in colombia and for which we will receive a interest in the serrania contract 
in september  we elected to participate for our percentage interest in the los picachos technical evaluation agreement the los picachos tea 
the los picachos tea was entered into in august by and between the colombian national hydrocarbons agency the anh and hupecol operating co 
llc and encompasses an  acre region located to the west and northwest of the serrania block  which is located in the municipalities of uribe and la macarena in the department of meta in the republic of colombia 
as a result of the election to participate  we agreed to pay our proportionate share  or  of the acquisition costs and costs for the minimum work program contained in the los picachos tea 
on october   we announced the approval by the anh of a farmout agreement and joint operating agreement with sk energy co 
ltd  a korean multinational conglomerate sk energy  relating to the cpo contract for exploration and production the cpo contract covering the  net acre cpo block located in the western llanos basin in the republic of colombia

our share of the past costs was the phase work program consists of reprocessing approximately kilometers of existing d seismic data  the acquisition  processing and interpretation of a d seismic program containing approximately kilometers of data and the drilling of two exploration wells 
the phase work program is estimated to be completed by june  our share of the costs for the entire phase work program are estimated to total approximately  subsequent to year end  in february  we elected to participate for our percentage interest in the macaya technical evaluation agreement the macaya tea 
the macaya tea was entered into in february by and between the anh and hupecol and encompasses a  acre region located to the southeast of the serrania block 
as a result of the election to participate  we agreed to pay our proportionate share  or  of the acquisition costs and costs for the minimum work program contained in the macaya tea 
acquisition activity in light of our debt free capital structure  solid cash position and low overhead and in response to conditions in the oil and gas market  in particular the non economical cost and capital structures of many operators and financiers following the sharp decline in commodity prices during the second half of continuing into early  during the first half of  we began actively seeking opportunistic oil and gas acquisitions 
pursuant to those efforts  on february   we entered into a letter agreement the letter agreement with yazoo pipeline co  lp yazoo  sterling exploration production co  llc sterling  and matagorda operating company together with yazoo and sterling  the debtors  pursuant to which we agreed to provide debtor in possession financing dip financing to the debtors subject to approval of the letter agreement by the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas the bankruptcy court 
on february   the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the dip financing on the terms set out in the letter agreement 
under the terms of the letter agreement  we agreed to advance to the debtors up to  with all advances bearing interest at per annum and being repayable in full ninety days from approval of the dip financing by the bankruptcy court  or the earlier consummation of a sale of the principal assets of the debtors to our company 
under the letter agreement  we and the debtors agreed to commence negotiations and due diligence with respect to the potential acquisition by our company of the principal assets of the debtors based on certain financial terms described in the letter agreement 
advances were made under the letter agreement in the total amount of  pursuant to our rights under the letter agreement  after conducting due diligence with respect to the debtors  we determined to terminate negotiations with the debtors with respect to the potential acquisition of the assets of the debtors 
on april   the debtors repaid the dip financing in full in the amount of  including principal and interest  and at december  no amounts were owed to us relative to the dip financing 
we intend to continue to seek out and evaluate opportunities to acquire existing oil and gas assets and operations where we determine attractive returns on invested capital can be realized in current market conditions and superior returns can be derived from a recovery in primary prices 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be successful in our efforts to identify and acquire oil and gas assets or operations or that any acquisitions that may be consummated will provide the returns expected by management

index to financial statements possible hupecol transaction in september  we were advised that hupecol llc had retained scotia waterous for purposes of evaluating a possible transaction a transaction involving the monetization of five exploration and production contracts covering approximately  acres comprising the leona block  la cuerva block  dorotea block  las garzas block and cabiona block in colombia 
the transaction may involve the sale of some or all of the assets and operations of the subject properties  an exchange or trade of assets  or other similar transaction and may be effected in a single transaction or a series of transactions 
scotia waterous has established a process whereby interested parties may evaluate a potential transaction and has established a due date for proposals of april  we are an investor in hupecol and our interest in the assets and operations of hupecol that would be included in any transaction represent a substantial portion of our assets and operations in colombia and are our principal revenue producing assets and operations 
we intend to closely monitor the nature and progress of the transaction in order to protect the interests of our company and our shareholders 
however  we have no effective ability to alter or prevent a transaction and are unable to predict whether or not a transaction will in fact occur or the nature or timing of any such transaction 
further  we are unable to estimate the actual value that we might derive from any such transaction and whether any such transaction will ultimately be beneficial to our company and our shareholders 
seismic activity during  our operators in colombia acquired approximately square miles of additional seismic and geological data 
the additional data relates primarily to the serrania and la cuerva concessions where we hold and working interest  respectively 
our share of the costs of such data acquisition was  compensation expense stock options during  we granted  stock options to our chief financial officer and  stock options to our non employee directors 
our total non cash compensation expense for was  sale of common stock in december  we sold  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to select institutional investors at per share pursuant to which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general working capital purposes  including funding our share of costs of development of properties in which we hold interests in colombia and in the us dividends during  we declared and paid cash dividends to our shareholders of per share  or an aggregate of  critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting 
such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method 

table of contents 
index to financial statements full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  costs of drilling  completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  but does not include any cost related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved 
no corporate overhead has been capitalized as of december  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves are amortized on a units of production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation 
the capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated amortization  are limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves  calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the preceding twelve months such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties and a discount factor of  b the cost of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized  c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  and d related income tax effects 
excess costs are charged to proved properties impairment expense 
unevaluated oil and gas properties 
unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases  net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties 
when leases are developed  expire or are abandoned  the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to depletable oil and gas properties 
additionally  we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments  and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases 
unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at december  and at december  at december  acquisition costs evaluation costs retention costs total the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects include  and  expended for properties in south america at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining our interest in these properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the vesting term  dividend yield  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations

index to financial statements results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues 
total oil and gas revenues decreased  to  in from  in the decrease in oil and gas revenue was due to a decline in oil and gas prices received during approximately  based on lower average gas prices realized during and approximately million based on lower average oil prices  the cessation of production and sales from the majority of our colombian properties for days in early  and the sale of our caracara interest in june the following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells  net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales prices for and gross producing wells net producing wells net oil production bbls net gas production mcf oil average sales price per barrel gas average sales price per mcf production volumes were less then what they otherwise would have been in due to the sale of our caracara interest during accounting for  barrels of production and  of revenues during and the cessation of production and sales from the majority of our colombian properties for days in early as a result of unfavorable commodity prices  partially offset by increased production in fields in which we hold higher working interests vs

giving pro forma effect to exclude sales revenues from the caracara interest  which was sold in june  oil and gas revenues for would have been  the decline in average sales prices realized reflects the sharp worldwide economic decline  and accompanying decline in commodity prices  during the second half of continuing through oil and gas sales revenues for and  by region  were as follows colombia us total oil sales gas sales oil sales gas sales lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses  excluding joint venture expenses relating to our colombian operations discussed below  increased to  in from  in the increase in lease operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  from of revenues in to of revenues in  was primarily attributable to the temporary cessation of production from a majority of our colombian properties during the period as discussed above  the steep decline in oil and gas prices and an increase in our average working interest following the caracara

following is a summary comparison of lease operating expenses for the periods 
colombia us total hupecol  our operator in colombia  has implemented cost cutting measures in order to improve field economics from our colombian operations 
we have also seen declines in drilling and operating costs in the llanos basin which  together  are expected to result in improved margins during and beyond 
joint venture expenses 
joint venture expenses totaled  in compared to  in the joint venture expenses represent our allocable share of the indirect field operating and region administrative expenses billed by the operator of the colombian concessions 
the decrease in joint venture expenses was attributable to the decrease in the number of producing wells during depreciation and depletion expense 
depreciation and depletion expense decreased by to  in from  in the decrease in depreciation and depletion was due to an increase in reserves due to exploration and development 
this resulting increase in our reserves from exploration and development activities lowered our depreciation rate per barrel 
impairment expense 
during  we recorded a provision for impairment of oil and gas properties of  most of which was attributable to our south american properties 
impairments related to reduced commodity prices at year end and lower reserve estimates for our colombian wells  reduced reserve estimates for our us properties as a result of lower commodity prices and lower then expected production volumes  as well as the lack of commercial production on our caddo lake prospect 
gain on sale of oil gas properties 
the sale of our caracara assets resulted in a gain of  during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased by to  in from  in the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to decreases in employee compensation and professional fees  including a decrease of  related to cash bonuses paid in not repeated in and  related to restricted stocks grants in other income 
other income consists of interest earned on cash balances and marketable securities 
other income totaled  in as compared to  in the decrease in other income resulted from the sale of the balance of our marketable securities during early and a reduction in interest rates on short term cash investments  partially offset by interest earned on dip financing provided to the creditors under the letter agreement 
income tax expense benefit 
we reported an income tax benefit of  in as compared to an income tax benefit of  in the income tax benefit during was primarily attributable to net operating losses generated in colombia and the united states and the refund during of approximately  of colombian taxes 
the income tax benefit during was attributable  to the us and  to colombia 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the income tax benefit during was primarily attributable to a decrease in valuation allowance and the availability of us foreign tax credits that more than offset taxes attributable to operating income in colombia 
a deferred income tax benefit in the amount of  was attributable to the us and income tax expense in the amount of  was attributable to colombia during income tax expense during was entirely attributable to operations in colombia 
at december   we had foreign tax credit carryovers of  currently  we expect to be able to utilize the incremental foreign tax credit carry forward and net operating loss generated during and  therefore  no additional valuation allowance has been recorded to date 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had a cash balance of  and working capital of  compared to a cash balance of  and working capital of  at december  the increase in working capital during the period was primarily attributable to the receipt of  net proceeds from the sale of common stock in december  partially offset by payment of drilling costs  acquisition costs  operating costs in colombia and dividends 
cash flows 
operating activities used cash during totaling  as compared to  of cash provided by operations during the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily a result of a decrease in revenue due to lower commodity prices and the shut in of colombian production for part of the year 
investing activities used  during compared to  provided during the funds used by investing activities during reflect investments in oil and gas properties and assets of  partially offset by the receipt of  from the escrow account related to the sale of the caracara assets and  from the sale of selected domestic prospects  including profit island and north profit island

long term liabilities 
at december   we had long term liabilities of  as compared to  at december  long term liabilities at december  and december  consisted of a reserve for plugging costs and deferred rent liability 
the increase in of long term liabilities was a result of increased plugging cost from drilling in colombia 
capital and exploration expenditures and commitments 
our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to our ongoing efforts to acquire  drill and complete prospects 
we expect that future capital and exploration expenditures will be funded principally through funds generated from operations and funds on hand  including funds generated from our sale of common stock 
during  we invested approximately  for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties  which included expenses related to drilling of wells in colombia

the following table details our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total years operating leases total in addition to the contractual obligations requiring that we make fixed payments  in conjunction with our efforts to secure oil and gas prospects  financing and services  we have  from time to time  granted overriding royalty interests orri in various properties  and may grant orris in the future  pursuant to which we will be obligated to pay a portion of our interest in revenues from various prospects to third parties 
planned drilling  leasehold and other activities 
as of december   our acquisition and drilling budget for totaled approximately million and related principally to drilling eight wells in colombia on existing hupecol prospects  seismic work and drilling two wells on the serrania block operated by shona energy  seismic work and preparation for drilling two wells on the cpo block operated by sk energy  and drilling one well on domestic prospects 
additional wells may be drilled at locations to be determined based on the results of the planned drilling projects 
our acquisition and drilling budget has historically been subject to substantial fluctuation over the course of a year based upon successes and failures in drilling and completion of prospects and the identification of additional prospects during the course of a year 
in particular  we note that  in light of the sharp decline in commodity prices during the second half of and early  we expanded our efforts to seek out favorable asset acquisition opportunities 
should we pursue any such opportunities  our acquisition and drilling budget could be materially altered 
management presently anticipates that our total expenditures relating to exploration and development of the cpo bloc will be approximately million running through and including million budgeted during management anticipates that our current financial resources combined with expected operating cash flows  will meet our anticipated objectives and business operations  including investments in the cpo block and other planned property acquisitions and drilling activities  for at least the next months  without the need for additional capital 
management anticipates that available capital resources will be supplemented by the expected proceeds from the potential sale of a portion of the hupecol properties  although there is no assurance as to whether such a sale will in fact take place or  if such a sale does occur  the timing of such a sale or the proceeds that may be realized from such a sale 
because the timing and actual costs and results associated with development of the serrania block and cpo block cannot be predicted with certainty and because we continually seek opportunities to acquire and develop reserves  it is possible that we may require and seek additional financing to support development of existing prospects or additional prospects that may be acquired in the future 
we have no commitments to provide any additional financing should we require and seek such financing and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all  to support future acquisitions and development activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we have not historically entered into any hedges or other derivative commodity instruments or transactions designed to manage  or limit exposure to oil and gas price volatility
