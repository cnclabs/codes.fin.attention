item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in multi family and commercial real estate related bridge loans  junior participating interests in first mortgages  mezzanine loans  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we have also invested in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases  this will have a negative impact on earnings 
however  if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio 
see current market conditions  risks and recent trends below for risks and trends of our net interest income 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
if there are increases in foreclosures and non performing loans and investments  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses and asset management related expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
additionally  under the terms of certain financing agreements  annual dividends are required to be paid in the form of our stock to the maximum extent permissible currently  with the balance payable in cash 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income may be held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
for the year ended december   we did not record a provision for income taxes related to the assets that are held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
on july   acm  our manager  contributed million of structured finance assets  encumbered by million of borrowings in exchange for an equity interest in our operating partnership represented by  units of limited partnership interest and  warrants to acquire additional units of limited partnership interest 
in addition  certain employees of acm became our employees 
we are externally managed and advised by acm and pay acm a management fee in accordance with a management agreement 
acm originates  underwrites and services all structured finance assets on behalf of our operating partnership 
concurrently with acm s asset contribution  we consummated a private placement of million units  each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock  for 
table of contents per unit  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
gross proceeds from the private placement combined with the concurrent equity contribution by acm totaled approximately million in equity capital 
on april   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering expenses 
on may   we issued and sold  additional shares of common stock  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount pursuant to the exercise of a portion of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters of our initial public offering 
as of december   we issued  shares of common stock from the exercise of warrants originally issued as a component of units on july   for proceeds of million 
in addition  in june  we issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million 
current market conditions  risks and recent trends global stock and credit markets have experienced prolonged price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
commercial real estate classes in general have been adversely affected by this prolonged economic downturn and liquidity crisis 
if this continues  the commercial real estate sector will likely experience additional losses  challenges in complying with the terms of financing agreements  decreased net interest spreads  and additional difficulties in raising capital and obtaining investment financing with attractive terms or at all 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets and have resulted in the scarcity of certain types of financing  and  in some cases  making terms for available financings less attractive 
if these conditions persist  lending institutions may be forced to exit markets such as repurchase lending  become insolvent  further tighten their lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital required to obtain financing  and in such event  could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing for our investments 
a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
during the third quarter of  we restructured substantially all of our short term debt for three years at costs of financing higher than previous rates 
this has and will continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margins 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay our loans as they may experience difficulties in selling assets  increased costs of financing or obtaining financing at all 
these events in the stock and credit markets may also make it more difficult or unlikely for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us or the economy in general 
this environment has undoubtedly had a significant impact on our business  our borrowers and real estate values throughout all asset classes and geographic locations 
declining real estate values will likely continue to minimize our level of new mortgage loan originations  since borrowers often use increases in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties 
borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans if the real estate economy continues to weaken 
declining real estate values also significantly increase the likelihood that we will continue to incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originate  sell and securitize loans  which would significantly harm our revenues  results of operations  financial condition  business prospects and our ability to make distributions to the stockholders 
in addition  our investments are also subject to the risks described above with respect to commercial real estate loans and mortgage backed securities and similar risks  including risks of delinquency and foreclosure  the dependence upon the successful operation of  and net income from  real property  risks generally related to interests in real property  and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property 
during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  respectively  we recorded million  million  million and million of new provisions for loan losses for a total of million  due to declining collateral values  and million  million  million and million of losses on restructured 
table of contents loans for a total of million in during the first three quarters of fiscal year  we recorded million of provisions for loan losses and million in the fourth quarter for a total of million  and no loss on restructured loans was recorded in we have made  and continue to make modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so 
in some cases  modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower can not comply with loan terms 
in doing so  lower borrower interest rates  combined with non performing loans  will lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing 
these trends may persist with a prolonged economic recession and we feel that there will be continued modifications and delinquencies in the foreseeable future  which will result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector 
commercial real estate financing companies have been severely impacted by the current economic environment and have had very little access to the capital markets or the debt markets in order to meet their existing obligations or to refinance maturing debt 
we have responded to these troubled times by decreasing investment activity for capital preservation  aggressively managing our assets through restructuring and extending our debt facilities and repurchasing our previously issued debt at discounts when economically feasible 
in order to accomplish these goals  we have worked closely with our borrowers in restructuring our loans  receiving payoffs and paydowns and monetizing our investments as appropriate 
additionally  as mentioned above  we were successful in restructuring our short term debt facilities  and  based on available liquidity and market opportunities  have from time to time repurchased our debt at a discount 
also  in  we entered into an agreement with wachovia bank  national association to retire our outstanding debt for million at any time on or before an extended payoff date of august  and we retired million of our junior subordinated notes for the re issuance of certain of our own cdo bonds  as well as other assets 
we will continue to remain focused on executing these strategies when appropriate and where available as this significant economic downturn persists 
refer to item a risk factors above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for additional risk factors 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily from interest received from making real estate related bridge  mezzanine and junior participation loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
interest income is also derived from profits on equity participation interests 
no such income was recognized in in and interest income from participation interests represented approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
we also derive interest income from our investments in commercial real estate cre collateralized debt obligation bond securities and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
interest on these investments represented and of our total revenues in and  respectively  and less than of our total revenues in property operating income is derived from our real estate owned 
in  property operating income represented of total revenue 
no such income was recognized in and additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and defeasance fees  and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented less than of our total revenues in  and loss or income from equity affiliates and gain on sale of loans and real estate we derive loss or income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under either the equity or cost method of accounting as appropriate 
we record our share of net income and losses from the underlying properties and any other than temporary impairment of these investments on a single line item in the consolidated statements 
table of contents of operations as loss or income from equity affiliates 
in and  loss from equity affiliates totaled million and million  respectively 
in  income from equity affiliates totaled million 
we also may derive income or losses from the sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate for our own investment and  upon stabilization  disposition at an anticipated return and real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
no such income or loss has been recorded to date 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
loans and investments at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading depending on ability and intent to hold 
we do not have any trading securities at this time 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value  while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
unrealized losses that are determined to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
the process may include  but is not limited to  assessment of recent market events and prospects for near term recovery  assessment of cash flows  internal review of the underlying assets securing the investments  credit of the issuer and the rating of the security  as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we closely monitor market conditions on which we base such decisions 
we also assess certain of our held to maturity securities  other than those of high credit quality  to determine whether significant changes in estimated cash flows or unrealized losses on these securities reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary  accordingly  such securities are written down to fair value against earnings 
on a quarterly basis  we review these changes in estimated cash flows  which could occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  to determine if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment  including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date  and the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that  in some cases  allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
impaired loans and allowance for loan losses loans are considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan 
table of contents agreement 
specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of collateral on an individual loan basis 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by selecting the most appropriate valuation methodology  or methodologies  among several generally available and accepted in the commercial real estate industry 
the determination of the most appropriate valuation methodology is based on the key characteristics of the collateral type 
these methodologies include the evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  and estimated sales value of the collateral computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we had a million allowance for loan losses at december  related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before reserves 
at december   we had a million allowance for loan losses related to ten loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before reserves 
repurchase obligations in certain circumstances  we have financed the purchase of investments from a counterparty through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty 
we currently record these investments in the same manner as other investments financed with repurchase agreements  with the investment recorded as an asset and the related borrowing under the repurchase agreement as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
interest income earned on the investments and interest expense incurred on the repurchase obligations are reported separately on the consolidated statement of operations 
these transactions may not qualify as a purchase by us under current accounting guidance  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we would be required to present the net investment on our balance sheet as a derivative with the corresponding change in fair value of the derivative being recorded in the statement of operations when certain criteria to treat these transactions as part of the same arrangements linked transactions are met 
the value of the derivative would reflect not only changes in the value of the underlying investment  but also changes in the value of the underlying credit provided by the counterparty 
the guidance applies to prospective transactions  and no such transactions have been recorded in this manner in capitalized interest we capitalize interest related to investments equity  loans and advances accounted for by the equity method as qualifying assets of the investor while the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations  provided that the investee s activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets for its operations 
one of our joint ventures  which is accounted for using the equity method  has used funds to acquire qualifying assets for its planned principal operations 
during  the joint venture sold both of the acquired properties and we discontinued the capitalization of interest on its remaining investment in the joint venture 
we did not capitalize interest during the years ended december  and  and we capitalized million of interest during the year ended december  relating to this investment 
real estate owned and held for sale real estate owned  shown net of accumulated depreciation  is comprised of real property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at the lower of the net carrying value of the loan previously collateralized by the real estate or estimated fair value of the real estate at the time of foreclosure or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
the net carrying value is the unpaid principal balance of the loan  adjusted for any unamortized deferred fees  loan loss allowances and amounts previously due to borrower 

table of contents costs incurred in connection with the foreclosure of the properties collateralizing the real estate loans are expensed as incurred and costs subsequently incurred to extend the life or improve the assets subsequent to foreclosure are capitalized 
we allocate the purchase price of operating properties to land  building  tenant improvements  deferred lease cost for the origination costs of the in place leases and to intangibles for the value of the above or below market leases at fair value 
we amortize the value allocated to the in place leases over the remaining lease term 
the value allocated to the above or below market leases are amortized over the remaining lease term as an adjustment to rental income 
real estate assets  including assets acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure that are operated for the production of income are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
ordinary repairs and maintenance which are not reimbursed by the tenants are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
we recognize impairment of real estate assets operated for the production of income if the estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
measurement of impairment is based upon the estimated fair value of the assets 
upon evaluating a property  many factors are considered  including estimated current and expected operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  costs necessary to extend the life or improve the asset  expected capitalization rates  projected stabilized net operating income  selling costs  and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate owned in the ordinary course of business 
valuation adjustments may be necessary in the event that effective interest rates  rent up periods  future economic conditions  and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in valuing the property 
if future evaluations result in a diminution in the value of the property  the reduction will be recognized as an impairment charge at that time 
real estate is classified as held for sale when management commits to a plan of sale  the asset is available for immediate sale  there is an active program to locate a buyer  and it is probable the sale will be complete within one year 
properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated and the results of their operations are shown in discontinued operations 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis 
we recognize sales of real estate properties only upon closing 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits 
profit on real estate sold is recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectability of the sale price is reasonably assured and we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale 
profit may be deferred in whole or in part until collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is complete 
revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and securities 
in many instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases  interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising from the purchase or origination of the loan or security 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management  a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination regarding collectability  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess 
table of contents cash flows being distributed and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
we did not record interest income on such investments for the year ended december   as compared to million and million of interest on such loans and investments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
property operating income 
property operating income represents income associated with the operation of two commercial real estate properties recorded as real estate owned 
for the years ended december   we recorded approximately million of property operating income relating to real estate owned 
at september   one of our three real estate investments was reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale and resulted in a reclassification from property operating income into discontinued operations for the current and all prior periods 
we did not have property operating income in and due to the subsequent reclassification to discontinued operations 
for more details see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related stock based award 
we measure the compensation costs for these shares as of the date of the grant  with subsequent remeasurement for any unvested shares granted to non employees with such amounts expensed against earnings  at the grant date for the portion that vest immediately or ratably over the respective vesting periods 
the cost of these grants is amortized over the vesting term 
dividends are paid on the restricted shares as dividends are paid on shares of our common stock whether or not they are vested 
stock based compensation was disclosed in our consolidated statement of operations under employee compensation and benefits for employees and under selling and administrative expense for non employees 
income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income are held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides clarity on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
variable interest entities current accounting guidance requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary pb 
the pb is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of the expected returns 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our loans and investments  mortgage related securities and investments in equity affiliates to determine whether they are vies 
this evaluation resulted in us determining that our bridge loans  junior participation loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments and investments in equity affiliates were potential variable interests 
for each of these investments  we have evaluated the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities equity investments at risk to absorb losses  that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have a the direct or indirect ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities significant activities  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected directly or indirectly  c the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity and their rights are not capped  substantially all of the entities activities do not involve or are not conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately fewer voting rights in terms of its obligation to absorb the expected losses or its right to receive expected residual returns of the entity  or both 

table of contents entities that issue junior subordinated notes are considered vies 
however  it is not appropriate to consolidate these entities  as equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk 
since our investments were funded by the entities that issued the junior subordinated notes  they are not considered to be at risk 
in addition  we have evaluated our investments in collateralized debt obligation securities and have determined that the issuing entities are considered vies  but have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary 
we will be required to follow updated accounting guidance beginning with the first quarter of  by prescribing an ongoing qualitative rather than quantitative assessment of our ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses  in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have identified loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be vies with an aggregate carrying amount of million 
these vie entities had exposure to real estate debt of approximately billion at december  for the vies identified  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as such the vies should not be consolidated in our financial statements 
for all other investments  we have determined they are not vies 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
a summary of our identified vies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
derivatives and hedging activities the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
additionally  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether a company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting 
during the year ended december   we entered into one new interest rate swap that qualifies as a cash flow hedge with a notional value of approximately million and paid million  which will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the swap 
during the year ended december   we entered into six interest rate swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges  having a total combined notional value of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we terminated six interest rate swaps related to our restructured trust preferred securities  with a combined notional value of million  for a loss of million recorded to loss on termination of swaps on our consolidated statement of operations 
refer to the section titled liquidity and capital resources junior subordinated notes below 
during the year ended december   we also terminated two interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of approximately million and a million portion of an interest rate swap with a total notional value of approximately million 
additionally  one basis swap with a notional amount of million matured and one basis swap and one interest rate swap had partially amortizing maturities totaling approximately million 
the remaining losses 
table of contents on termination will be amortized to interest expense over the original life of the hedging instruments 
the fair value of our qualifying hedge portfolio has increased by approximately million from december  as a result of the terminated and matured swaps  combined with a change in the projected libor rates and credit spreads of both parties 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see interest rate risk in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  set forth in item a hereof 
fair value measurements current accounting guidance for financial assets and liabilities defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures 
this standard does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  willing parties 
a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor  not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity 
assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels  defined by the guidance and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
the types of assets and liabilities carried at level fair value generally are government and agency securities  equities listed in active markets  investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs include quoted market prices in markets that are not active for an identical or similar asset or liability  and quoted market prices in active markets for a similar asset or liability 
fair valued assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are non government securities  municipal bonds  certain hybrid financial instruments  certain mortgage and asset backed securities including cdo bonds  certain corporate debt  certain commitments and guarantees  certain private equity investments and certain derivatives 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
these valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs that require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain private equity investments  certain municipal bonds  certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives 
determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including available for sale securities and derivative financial instruments 
fair values of our derivative financial instruments were approximated on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well 
table of contents recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions 
these items were included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we incorporated credit valuation adjustments in the fair values of our derivative financial instruments to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk 
in addition  the fair value of our available for sale securities were approximated on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including loans and securities held to maturity 
fair values of loans were estimated using discounted cash flow methodology  using discount rates  which  in the opinion of management  best reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with similar characteristics and credit quality 
loans are designated as held for investment and are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we perform evaluations of our loans to determine if the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  which may result in an allowance and corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
in addition  the fair values of our securities held to maturity were approximated on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities

as of december  and  we were in compliance with all reit requirements and  therefore  have not provided for income tax expense for years ended december  and certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income are owned by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income taxes 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million provision on income from these taxable reit subsidiaries 
no such provision was recognized for the year ended december  the provision for the year ended december  resulted from million of pretax income from our taxable reit subsidiaries 
loss from discontinued operations during the third quarter of  we mutually agreed with a first mortgage lender to appoint a receiver to operate one of our real estate owned investments and we are working to assist in the transfer of title to the first mortgage lender 
as a result  this investment was reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale and property operating income and expenses  which netted to a loss of million in  were reclassified to discontinued operations 
there were no property operating income and expenses in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased by million  or  to million in from million in these amounts represent the portion of our income allocated to our manager as well as a third party s interest in a consolidated subsidiary which holds a note payable that is accruing interest expense 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our manager s limited partnership interest in us 
our manager had a weighted average limited partnership interest of in our operating partnership in compared to in in june  our manager exercised its right to redeem its  operating partnership units in our operating partnership for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
as a result  our manager s operating partnership ownership interest percentage was reduced to zero at june  this decrease was also due to a decrease in the average income before noncontrolling interest reduced by the provision for income taxes for the first two quarters of as compared to all four quarters of included a loss allocated to noncontrolling interest of million representing a third party member s share of a million distribution received from a profits interest 
in addition  also included a gain allocated to noncontrolling interest of million representing the portion of loss allocated to the third party s interest in a consolidated subsidiary  which holds a note payable that is accruing interest expense 
this note payable is related to the pom transaction discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future loans and investments  fund additional cash collateral from potential declines in the value of a portion of our interest rate swaps  fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity offerings  debt facilities and cash flows from operations 
our equity 
table of contents sources consist of funds raised from our private equity offering in july  net proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock in april  net proceeds from our public offering of our common stock in june and depending on market conditions  proceeds from capital market transactions including the future issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our cdos  the issuance of junior subordinated notes and borrowings under credit agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest expense on our debt facilities  cash from equity participation interests  repayments of outstanding loans and investments and funds from junior loan participation arrangements 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term and long term liquidity needs 
our loans and investments are financed under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to renew our sources of financing on substantially similar terms or at all  it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
current conditions in the capital and credit markets have made certain forms of financing less attractive and  in certain cases  less available  therefore we will continue to rely on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital 
to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements 
in december  the irs issued revenue procedure that allows listed reits to offer shareholders elective stock dividends  which are paid in a combination of cash and common stock with at least of the total distribution paid in cash  to satisfy future dividend requirements 
equity offerings our authorized capital provides for the issuance of up to million shares of common stock  par value per share  and million shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
in march  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec under the securities act of the act with respect to an aggregate of million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants that may be sold by us from time to time pursuant to rule of the act 
on april   the commission declared this shelf registration statement effective 
in june  we sold  shares of our common stock registered on the shelf registration statement in a public offering at a price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses 
we used the proceeds to pay down debt and finance our loan and investment portfolio 
the underwriters did not exercise their over allotment option for additional shares 
in august  we entered into an equity placement program sales agreement with a securities agent whereby we may issue and sell up to three million shares of our common stock through the agent who agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and under the terms set forth therein 
to date  we have not utilized this equity placement program 
at december   we had million available under the shelf registration described above and  shares outstanding 

table of contents debt facilities we also currently maintain liquidity through a term credit agreement  which has a revolving component  two master repurchase agreements  one working capital facility  one note payable and three junior loan participations with five different financial institutions or companies 
in addition  we have issued three collateralized debt obligations or cdos and separate junior subordinated notes 
london inter bank offered rate  or libor  refers to one month libor unless specifically stated 
as of december   these facilities had an aggregate capacity of billion and borrowings were approximately billion 
the following is a summary of our debt facilities as of december  at december  debt maturity debt facilities commitment carrying value available dates repurchase agreements

in july  we amended and restructured our term credit agreements  revolving credit agreement and working capital facility with wachovia bank  national association as discussed below 
these debt facilities are described in further detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
repurchase agreements repurchase obligation financings provide us with a revolving component to our debt structure 
repurchase agreements provide stand alone financing for certain assets and interim  or warehouse financing  for assets that we plan to contribute to our cdos 
at december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these facilities was million 
we had a million repurchase agreement with a financial institution that expired in and had interest at pricing over libor  varying on the type of asset financed 
in june  this facility  with approximately million outstanding  was satisfied at a discount for million resulting in a million gain on extinguishment of debt 
in connection with this transaction  we sold a bridge loan financed in this facility with a carrying value of million  at a discount  for approximately million and recorded a loss on restructuring of million 
the proceeds were used to satisfy the million cash payment 
we have a repurchase agreement with a second financial institution that bears interest at basis points over libor and had a term expiring in june in june  we amended this facility extending the maturity to june  with a one year extension option 
in addition  the amendment includes the removal of all financial covenants and a reduction of the committed amount to million reflecting the one asset currently financed in this facility 
during the year ended december   we paid down approximately million of this facility 
at december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million with a current weighted average note rate of we have an uncommitted master repurchase agreement with a third financial institution  effective april  entered into for the purpose of financing our cre cdo bond securities 
the agreement has a term expiring in may 
table of contents and bears interest at pricing over libor  varying on the type of asset financed 
during the year ended december   we paid down approximately million of this facility  due to a decrease in values associated with a change in market interest rate spreads and an additional million of principal 
at december   the outstanding balance under this facility was million with a current weighted average note rate of 
in january  the facility was repaid in full 
cdos we completed three separate cdos since by issuing to third party investors  tranches of investment grade collateralized debt obligations through newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries the issuers 
the issuers hold assets  consisting primarily of real estate related assets and cash which serve as collateral for the cdos 
the assets pledged as collateral for the cdos were contributed from our existing portfolio of assets 
by contributing these real estate assets to the various cdos  these transactions resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the corresponding cdo assets and created capacity in our existing credit facilities 
the issuers issued tranches of investment grade floating rate notes of approximately million  million and million for cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii  respectively 
cdo iii also has a million revolving note which was not drawn upon at the time of issuance 
the revolving note facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the facility 
the tranches were issued with floating rate coupons based on three month libor plus pricing of 
proceeds from the sale of the investment grade tranches issued in cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii of million  million and million  respectively  were used to repay higher costing outstanding debt under our repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the cdos may be replenished with substitute collateral for loans that are repaid during the first four years for cdo i and the first five years for cdo ii and cdo iii  subject to certain customary provisions 
thereafter  the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid 
proceeds from the repayment of assets which serve as collateral for the cdos must be retained in its structure as restricted cash until such collateral can be replaced and therefore not available to fund current cash needs 
if such cash is not used to replenish collateral  it could have a negative impact on our anticipated returns 
proceeds from cdo ii are distributed quarterly with approximately million being paid to investors as a reduction of the cdo liability 
as of april   cdo i reached the end of its replenishment date and will no longer make quarterly amortization payments to investors 
investor capital will be repaid quarterly from proceeds received from loan repayments held as collateral in accordance with the terms of the cdo 
proceeds distributed will be recorded as a reduction of the cdo liability 
for accounting purposes  cdos are consolidated in our financial statements 
during the year ended december   we purchased  at a discount  approximately million of investment grade rated notes originally issued by our cdo issuing entities for a price of million 
we recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million and a reduction of outstanding debt totaling million from these transactions in our financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we purchased  at a discount  approximately million of investment grade rated notes originally issued by our cdo i issuing entity for a price of million  million of investment grade rated notes originally issued by our cdo ii issuing entity for a price of million and million originally issued by our cdo iii issuing entity for a price of million from third party investors 
we will record a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million from these transactions in our consolidated statements of operations 
in february  we re issued the cdo bonds we had acquired throughout with an aggregate face amount of million  as well as cdo bonds from other issuers acquired in the second quarter of with an aggregate face amount of million and a carrying value of million  and million in cash  in exchange for the retirement of million of our junior subordinated notes 
see junior subordinated notes below 
at december   the outstanding note balance under cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii was million  million and million  respectively 
the continued turmoil in the structured finance markets  in particular the sub prime residential loan market  has negatively impacted the credit markets generally  and  as a result  investor demand for commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations has been substantially curtailed 
in recent years  we have relied to a substantial extent 
table of contents on cdo financings to obtain match funded financing for our investments 
until the market for commercial real estate cdos recovers  we may be unable to utilize cdos to finance our investments and we may need to utilize less favorable sources of financing to finance our investments on a long term basis 
there can be no assurance as to when demand for commercial real estate cdos will return or the terms of such securities investors will demand or whether we will be able to issue cdos to finance our investments on terms beneficial to us 
our cdo bonds contain interest coverage and asset over collateralization covenants that must be met as of the waterfall distribution date in order for us to receive such payments 
if we fail these covenants in any of our cdos  all cash flows from the applicable cdo would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding cdo bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that cdo regained compliance with such tests 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  in the event of a breach of the cdo covenants that could not be cured in the near term  we would be required to fund our non cdo expenses  including management fees and employee costs  distributions required to maintain reit status  debt costs  and other expenses with i cash on hand  ii income from any cdo not in breach of a covenant test  iii income from real property and unencumbered loan assets  iv sale of assets  v or accessing the equity or debt capital markets  if available 
we have the ability to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non performing loans out of the cdos 
however  we may not have sufficient liquidity available to do so at such time 
the chart below is a summary of our cdo compliance tests as of the most recent distribution date cash flow triggers cdo i cdo ii cdo iii overcollateralization current limit pass fail pass pass pass interest coverage current limit pass fail pass pass pass the overcollateralization ratio divides the total principal balance of all collateral in the cdo by the total bonds outstanding for the classes senior to those retained by us 
to the extent an asset is considered a defaulted security  the asset s principal balance is multiplied by the asset s recovery rate which is determined by the rating agencies 
the interest coverage ratio divides interest income by interest expense for the classes senior to those retained by us 
junior subordinated notes in may  we exchanged million of our outstanding trust preferred securities  consisting of million of junior subordinated notes issued to third party investors and million of common equity issued to us in exchange for million of newly issued unsecured junior subordinated notes  representing of the original face amount 
the new notes bear a fixed interest rate of per annum until april  the modification period  and then interest is to be paid at the rates set forth in the existing trust agreements until maturity  equal to a weighted average three month libor plus 
we paid a transaction fee of approximately million to the issuers of the junior subordinated notes related to this restructuring 
in july  we restructured the remaining million of trust preferred securities that were not exchanged from the may restructuring transaction previously disclosed

this requirement regarding distributions in stock can be terminated by us at any time  provided that we pay the note holders the original rate of interest from the time of such termination 
the junior subordinated notes are unsecured  have a maturity of to years  pay interest quarterly at a fixed rate or floating rate of interest based on three month libor and  absent the occurrence of special events  are not redeemable during the first two years 
in connection with the issuance of the original variable rate junior subordinated notes  we had entered into various interest rate swap agreements which were subsequently terminated upon the exchange discussed above

upon the closing of the pom transaction in march  the note balance was increased to million  bears interest at a fixed rate of and is secured by our investment in common and preferred operating partnership units in lightstone value plus reit  lp 
table of contents we have three junior loan participations with a total outstanding balance at december  of million 
these participation borrowings have a maturity date equal to the corresponding mortgage loan and are secured by the participant s interest in the mortgage loans 
interest expense is based on a portion of the interest received from the loans 
in  we entered into an agreement with wachovia bank  national association  owned by wells fargo bank  national association  to retire all of our million of then outstanding debt for million  representing of the face amount of the debt 
the million of indebtedness was comprised of million of term debt and a million working capital facility  representing the outstanding balances in each facility at the time the parties began to negotiate the agreement 
the agreement can be closed at any time on or before may  and also has two consecutive day extension options which would extend the payoff date to august  the agreement provides the ability to apply paydowns in the wachovia facilities against the discounted payoff amount during the term of the agreement and accordingly  we have made payments of million towards the initial discounted payoff amount  leaving million payable to wachovia to close this agreement 
the closing of this transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and our ability to obtain the necessary capital 
we can make no assurances that we will be able to access sufficient capital under acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  we have obtained a waiver of our minimum tangible net worth covenant  as well as our minimum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth covenant  from this financial institution for december  through the extended payoff date of august  we have also obtained temporary amendments thereafter until december for the quarterly minimum gaap tangible net worth covenants  from million to million  and quarterly maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth covenants  from to to to see restrictive covenants below for further details mortgage note payable held for sale during the second quarter of  we recorded a million first lien mortgage related to the foreclosure of an entity in which we had a million mezzanine loan

at december   we had outstanding borrowings due to acm totaling million  which was recorded in notes payable related party 
in january  the loan was repaid in full 
the term credit agreement  working capital facility and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay interest monthly  based on pricing over libor 
the amount of our pricing over these rates varies depending upon the structure of the loan or investment financed pursuant to the specific agreement 
these facilities also require that we pay down borrowings based on balance reduction requirements or pro rata as principal payments on our loans and investments are received 
in addition  if upon maturity of a loan or investment we decide to grant the borrower an extension option  the financial institutions have the option to extend the borrowings or request payment in full on the outstanding borrowings of the loan or investment extended 
restrictive covenants each of the credit facilities contains various financial covenants and restrictions  including minimum net worth  minimum liquidity and debt to equity ratios 
in addition to the financial terms and capacities described above  our credit facilities generally contain covenants that prohibit us from effecting a change in control  disposing of or encumbering assets being financed and restrict us from making any material amendment to our underwriting guidelines without approval of the lender 
if we violate these covenants in any of our credit facilities  we could be required to pledge more collateral  or repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
if we are unable to retire our borrowings in such a situation  i we may need to prematurely sell the assets securing such debt  ii the lenders could accelerate the debt and foreclose on the assets that are pledged as collateral to such lenders  iii such lenders could force us into bankruptcy  iv such lenders could force us to take other actions to protect the value of their 
table of contents collateral and v our other debt financings could become immediately due and payable 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  the value of our common stock  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and our ability to continue as a going concern 
violations of these covenants may also result in our being unable to borrow unused amounts under our credit facilities  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
additionally  to the extent that we were to realize additional losses relating to our loans and investments  it would put additional pressure on our ability to continue to meet these covenants 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants and restrictions for the periods presented with the exception of a minimum tangible net worth requirement with wachovia at december  our tangible net worth was million at december  and we were required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million with this financial institution 
we have obtained a waiver of this covenant  as well as the minimum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth covenant  from this financial institution for december  and through an extended payoff date of august   in conjunction with amendments to our credit facilities 
we have also obtained temporary amendments thereafter until december for the quarterly minimum gaap tangible net worth covenants  from million to million  and quarterly maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth covenants  from to to to we also have certain cross default provisions whereby accelerated re payment would occur under the wachovia term credit and working capital facilities if any party defaults under any indebtedness in a principal amount of at least million in the aggregate beyond any applicable grace period regardless of whether the default has been or is waived 
also  a default under the junior subordinated indentures or any of the cdo s would trigger a default under our wachovia debt agreements  but not vice versa  and no payment due under the junior subordinated indentures may be paid if there is a default under any senior debt and the senior lender has sent notice to the trustee 
the junior subordinated indentures are also cross defaulted with each other 
cash flow from operations we continually monitor our cash position to determine the best use of funds to both maximize our return on funds and maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
historically  in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations has generally been used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
consequently  when making distributions in the past  we have borrowed the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
however  given current market conditions  we may have to maintain adequate liquidity from operations to make any future distributions 
contractual commitments as of december   we had the following material contractual obligations payments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total notes payable collateralized debt obligations repurchase agreements junior subordinated notes mortgage note payable held for sale outstanding unfunded commitments totals represents principal amounts due based on contractual maturities

off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
management agreement on august   we amended our management agreement with acm 
the amendment was negotiated by a special committee of our board of directors  consisting solely of independent directors and approved unanimously by all of the independent directors 
jmp securities llc served as financial advisor to the special committee and skadden  arps  slate  meagher flom llp served as its special counsel 
the agreement includes the following new terms  effective as of january  the existing base management fee structure  which is calculated as a percentage of our equity  was replaced with an arrangement whereby we will reimburse the manager for its actual costs incurred in managing our business based on the parties agreement in advance on an annual budget with subsequent quarterly true ups to actual costs 
this change was adopted retroactively to january  and we estimated the base management fee would be in the range of million to million 
the base management fee is estimated to be in the same range 
concurrent with this change  all future origination fees on investments will be retained by us  whereas under the prior agreement  origination fees up to of the loan were retained by acm 
in addition  we made a million payment to the manager in consideration of expenses incurred by the manager in in managing our business and certain other services 
these changes were accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 
the percentage hurdle for the incentive fee will be applied on a per share basis to the greater of and the average gross proceeds per share  whereas the previous management agreement provided for such percentage hurdle to be applied only to the average gross proceeds per share 
in addition  only of any loan loss and other reserve recoveries will be eligible to be included in the incentive fee calculation  which will be spread over a three year period  whereas the previous management agreement did not limit the inclusion of such recoveries in the incentive fee calculation 
the amended management agreement allows us to consider  from time to time  the payment of additional fees to the manager for accomplishing certain specified corporate objectives 
in accordance with the agreement  success based payments were paid for the trust preferred and wachovia debt restructurings totaling million in the third quarter of the amended management agreement modifies and simplifies the provisions related to the termination of the agreement and any related fees payable in such instances  including for internalization  with a 
table of contents termination fee of million  rather than payment based on a multiple of base and incentive fees as previously existed 
the amended management agreement will remain in effect until december   and will be renewed automatically for successive one year terms thereafter 
for performing services under the management agreement  we previously paid acm an annual base management fee payable monthly in cash as a percentage of arlp s equity and equal to per annum of the equity up to million  per annum of the equity from million to million and per annum of the equity in excess of million

table of contents management fee partially in  shares of common stock with the remainder to be paid in cash totaling million  which was subsequently paid in february we pay the annual incentive compensation in four installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive compensation are subject to recalculation and potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year  and any overpayments are required to be repaid in accordance with the amended management agreement

the incentive compensation is accrued as it is earned 
the expense incurred for incentive compensation paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive compensation paid to our manager in the form of common stock in accordance with current accounting guidance  which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  the expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the annual incentive compensation is determined 
in the event that the annual incentive compensation calculated as of the measurement date is less than the four quarterly installments of the annual incentive compensation paid in advance  our manager will refund the amount of such overpayment in cash and we would record a negative incentive compensation expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined 
origination fees origination fees paid by borrowers for loans or investments made by us  less any payments to unaffiliated third party brokers or other unaffiliated third party costs in connection with the origination of these investments  would be retained by us or otherwise reduce the base management fee installment for that month 
term and termination 
the amended management agreement has an initial term up to december  and is renewable automatically for an additional one year period every year thereafter  unless terminated with six months prior written notice 
if we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement without cause  we are required to pay a termination fee of million 
inflation changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
however  the significant decline in interest rates during the latter part of  and triggered libor floors on certain of our variable rate interest earning assets 
this resulted in an increase in interest rate spreads as the rates we pay on variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined at a greater pace than the rates we earned on our variable rate interest earning assets 
additionally  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be affected

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk 
market conditions we are subject to market changes in the debt and secondary mortgage markets 
these markets are currently experiencing disruptions  which could have an adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased risk adjusted premiums 
these conditions may increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate debt facilities from a variety of financing sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in these efforts  that such debt facilities will be adequate or that the cost of such debt facilities will be at similar terms 
the secondary mortgage markets are also currently experiencing disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for collateralized debt obligations and increased investor yield requirements for these obligations 
in light of these conditions  we currently expect to finance our loan and investment portfolio with our current capital and debt facilities 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  events such as natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes  acts of war and or terrorism such as the events of september  and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction delays  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reducing the value of collateral  and a lack of liquidity in the market  could reduce the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property s debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
many of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
one month libor approximated at december  and at december  
table of contents based on our loans  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million

in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in connection with our cdos described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the investor s return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
as of december  and  we had nine and ten of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have combined notional values of billion and billion  respectively 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there were a basis point and basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million for both periods 
if there were a basis point and basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million for both periods 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have a combined notional value of million 
as of december  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a combined notional value of million to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there had been a basis point and basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point and basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  
table of contents respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we have  in the past  entered into various interest rate swap agreements in connection with the issuance of variable rate junior subordinated notes 
these swaps had total notional values of million as of december  we no longer utilize interest rate swaps for the newly issued junior subordinated notes exchanged for the aforementioned junior subordinated notes due to the modified interest payment structure 
if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million 
certain of our interest rate swaps  which are designed to hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of our loans and investments  could require the funding of additional cash collateral for changes in the market value of these swaps 
due to the prolonged volatility in the financial markets that began in  the value of these interest rate swaps has declined substantially 
as a result  at december  and  we funded approximately million and million  respectively  in cash related to these swaps 
if we continue to experience significant changes in the outlook of interest rates  these contracts could continue to decline in value  which would require additional cash to be funded 
however  at maturity the value of these contracts return to par and all cash will be recovered 
if we do not have available cash to meet these requirements  this could result in the early termination of these interest rate swaps  leaving us exposed to interest rate risk associated with these loans and investments  which could adversely impact our financial condition 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes
