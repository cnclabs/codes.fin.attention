item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview cubic energy  inc is an independent upstream energy company engaged in the development and production of  and exploration for  crude oil and natural gas 
our oil and gas assets and activities are concentrated exclusively in louisiana and texas 
our corporate strategy with respect to our asset acquisition and development efforts was to position the company in a low risk opportunity while building main stream high yield reserves 
the acquisition of our cotton valley acreage in desoto and caddo parishes  louisiana  put us in a reservoir rich environment both in the cotton valley and bossier haynesville shale formations  and gives us the potential to discover additional commercial horizons that can add value to the bottom line 
we have had success on our acreage with wells drilled by achieving production from not only the cotton valley and bossier haynesville shale formations  but also the hosston formations

table of contents results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas sales increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal primarily due to increased gas volumes resulting from new haynesville shale wells  of which nine are operated by chesapeake energy corporation  three are operated by goodrich petroleum corporation and two are operated by exco resources  inc this increase was mitigated by the average price of natural gas being per mcf for fiscal and per mcf for fiscal costs and expenses oil and gas production  operating and development costs also referred to as lease operating expenses elsewhere herein increased to  of oil and gas sales for fiscal from  of oil and gas sales for fiscal primarily due to more wells being on line in louisiana  which resulted in a  increase in costs passed through to the company by the purchaser of the company s gas  a  increase in production taxes and a  increase in non operated property expenses 
these increases were somewhat offset by a  decrease in common facility costs and  decrease in salt water hauling 
general and administrative expenses g a increased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of a  increase in marketing expense  a  increase in legal fees due in part to the support needed to address the nyse amex non compliance issue  related expenses in connection with the november transaction between the company  tauren and langtry and costs of amending the wells fargo credit facility 
there was also a  increase in contracted professional services   of which went to nyse amex non compliance support and  went to sarbanes oxley compliance 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal related to the non operated development of oil and gas properties 
impairment of oil and gas properties decreased to in fiscal from  in fiscal the fiscal impairment resulted from a downward revision of our reserve estimates  which was effected by the following events i we experienced delays related to third party providers in our bethany longstreet acreage  including not receiving contracted for compression services  which temporarily delayed our ability to produce from these wells  ii we did not effectuate final completion of certain wells due to a shift in our focus to the development of our johnson branch acreage in caddo parish  louisiana  and  iii the lack of production history in wells recently brought online lead to a sharper decline curve being utilized by rps in formulating the reserve estimates 
gain on debt extinguishment was realized in december as a result of the refinancing of the debt with wells fargo 
the existing loan balance of  was decreased written off as a term of the amendment of the wells fargo credit facility that was extinguished  which was partially offset by debt extinguishment costs of  this created an overall gain on debt extinguishment of  for fiscal interest expense  including amortization of loan discount increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an increase in debt before discounts to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the drawing down of our revolving credit line of  before discounts of our amended wells fargo 
table of contents credit facility 
the weighted average debt balance before discounts for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal the credit facility with wells fargo also resulted in a loan discount being recorded 
the discount is being amortized over the original three year term of the debt as additional interest expense with  being recorded in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal there was a decrease in the capitalization of interest expense to the full cost pool for oil and gas properties of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas sales decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal primarily due to lower gas volumes resulting from a steep production decline curve and lack of funds to workover existing wells and a decrease in the weighted average sales price for gas per mcf 
this decline was mitigated by the company having an average of approximately gross wells being on line in louisiana in fiscal versus approximately gross wells in fiscal costs and expenses oil and gas production  operating and development costs also referred to as lease operating expenses elsewhere herein increased to  of oil and gas sales for fiscal from  of oil and gas sales for fiscal primarily due to more wells being on line in louisiana  which resulted in a  increase in common facility expenses  a  increase in chemical cost and a  increase in salt water hauling costs 
these increases were somewhat offset by a  decrease in costs passed through to the company by the purchaser of the company s gas 
such costs are deducted from the company s gross revenue by the purchaser 
general and administrative expenses g a decreased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of a  decrease in non cash stock compensation expense  due to a decrease in the number of shares of common stock granted versus the prior year period 
this decrease was somewhat offset by a  increase in corporate fees paid  which includes  in amex listing fees and a  increase due to adding two more outside directors  a  increase in legal fees due in part to the support needed to address the nyse amex non compliance issue  and  in contract services fees related to management s transition to a new chief financial officer  which occurred in fiscal  but did not occur in the prior year period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
impairment of oil and gas properties increased to  in fiscal from in fiscal the fiscal impairment resulted from a downward revision of our reserve estimates  which was effected by the following events i we experienced delays related to third party providers in our bethany longstreet acreage  including not receiving contracted for compression services  which temporarily delayed our ability to produce from these wells  ii we did not effectuate final completion of certain wells due to a shift in our focus to the development of our johnson branch acreage in caddo parish  louisiana  and  iii the lack of production history in wells recently brought online lead to a sharper decline curve being utilized by rps scotia  inc in formulating the reserve estimates

the discount is being amortized over the original three year term of the debt as additional interest expense with  being recorded in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal there was a decrease in the capitalization of interest expense to the full cost pool for oil and gas properties of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary resource is its oil and gas reserves 
on november   the company entered into transactions with tauren exploration  inc tauren and langtry mineral development  llc langtry  both of which are entities controlled by calvin wallen iii  the chief executive officer of the company  under which the company acquired  in pre paid drilling credits the drilling credits applicable towards the development of its haynesville shale rights in northwest louisiana 
the company expects to use the drilling credits to fund  of its share of the drilling and completion costs for those horizontal haynesville shale wells drilled in sections previously operated by an affiliate of the company which are now operated by a third party 
as of june    was the remaining balance of the drilling credits 
product prices  over which we have no control  have a significant impact on revenues from production and the value of such reserves and thereby on the company s borrowing capacity in the event the company determines to borrow additional funds 
within the confines of product pricing  the company needs to be able to find and develop or acquire oil and gas reserves in a cost effective manner in order to generate sufficient financial resources through internal means to complete the financing of its capital expenditure program 
during the twelve months ended june   the company used cash flows from operating activities of  as compared to  in fiscal cash flow from operations is dependent on our ability to increase production through our development and exploratory activities and the price received for oil and natural gas 
working capital and cash flow the company s working capital increased to  at june  from  at june  this increase was primarily due to  of debt scheduled to mature on march and april  becoming a part of current liabilities at june  this debt was subsequently refinanced to a maturity date of july  the company anticipates the following capital expenditures in the remainder of fiscal completions of up to four wells in its johnson branch acreage and up to four wells in its bethany longstreet acreage  drilling of these wells by a third party operator will use most of the  drilling credits balance remaining and these new non operated wells could produce enough revenue to continue to permit us to pay our expenses and service current debt as they come due 
as a result  our projected capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of approximately  to  for fiscal due to the significant downturn in the price of natural gas  continued prudence will be exercised in the undertaking of any new operations during the near term 
no assurance can be given that all or any of these anticipated projects will be completed as currently anticipated 
while we have re negotiated with wells fargo our revolving note to million  which was subject to a borrowing base limitation of million at 
table of contents june  currently million  and extended the maturity date to july   we believe that we currently have cash on hand to continue to meet our obligations and fund our projected capital expenditures for fiscal additionally  because future cash flows and the availability of borrowings are subject to a number of variables  such as prevailing prices of oil and gas  actual production from existing and newly completed wells  the company s success in developing and producing new reserves  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s development and exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s development and exploration activities 
capital expenditures the majority of our oil and gas reserves are undeveloped 
as such  recovery of the company s future undeveloped proved reserves will require significant capital expenditures 
our management estimates that aggregate capital expenditures ranging from a minimum of approximately  from currently available funds  drilling credits and projected cash from operating activities to a maximum of approximately  will be made to further develop these reserves during fiscal moreover  additional capital expenditures may be required for exploratory drilling on our undeveloped acreage 
the company may increase its planned activities for fiscal  if product prices improve 
if product prices remain flat or go lower such activities and our capital expenditures  will be restricted 
capital resources the company plans to fund its development and exploratory activities through cash on hand which was approximately  as of the date of this filing  the drilling credits  cash provided from operations  and one of  or a combination of  the following potential transactions a private placement of common stock  a public offering of common stock  a joint venture with an industry partner in which we would or could farm out a to be determined percentage of our working interests in certain properties  a disposition of assets  or other transactions 
while we expect production from the wells drilled and completed in fiscal   and subsequent to the end of fiscal to provide cash flow to support additional drilling in fiscal  the company cannot be certain that adequate funds will be available from cash on hand  operating cash flow  and the aforementioned potential transactions to fully fund the projected capital expenditures for fiscal additionally  because future cash flows  the availability of borrowings  and the ability to consummate any of the aforementioned potential transactions are subject to a number of variables  such as prevailing prices of oil and gas  actual production from existing and newly completed wells  the company s success in developing and producing new reserves  the uncertainty of financial markets and joint venture and merger and acquisition activity  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s development and exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s development and exploratory activities 
although the company believes it will be able to obtain funds pursuant to the above mentioned alternatives  management cannot be assured that such capital resources will be available to the company 
if we are unable to obtain such capital resources on a timely basis  the company may curtail its planned development and exploratory activities 
if a well is proposed by a third party operator and the company does not have a drilling credit or the capital resources to participate in that well the company might not receive any revenue generated by that well while still being required to fulfill the relevant royalty payment obligations to the mineral owner and other royalty holders 

table of contents critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we determined the critical policies by considering accounting policies that involve our most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to our proved reserves  accounts receivables  share based payments  our choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas properties  goodwill  asset retirement obligations and income taxes 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  and applying these rules and requirements requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
estimates of proved reserves the proved reserves data included in this annual report on form k was prepared in accordance with sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the technical qualifications  experience and judgment of the persons preparing the estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the assumptions used for our bossier haynesville  cotton valley and hosston well and reservoir characteristics and performance are subject to further refinement as more production history is accumulated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows represents the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves according to the requirements in the sec s release no 
modernization of oil and gas reporting  or release no 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the preparation of the estimate 
further  the mandated discount rate of may not be an accurate assumption of future interest rates 
proved reserves quantities directly and materially impact depletion expense 
if the proved reserves decline  then the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
a decline in the estimate of proved reserves may result from lower market prices  making it uneconomical to drill or produce from higher cost fields 
in addition  a decline in proved reserves may impact the outcome of our assessment of our oil and natural gas properties and require an impairment of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
proved reserves are defined as those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether the estimates is a deterministic 
table of contents estimate or probabilistic estimate 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced  or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project  within a reasonable time 
the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes both the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil and gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering  or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based  and the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period before the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
accounting for oil and natural gas properties the accounting for and disclosure of oil and natural gas producing activities requires that we choose between two gaap alternatives  the full cost method or the successful efforts method 
we use the full cost method of accounting  which involves capitalizing all acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development costs of oil and natural gas properties 
once we incur costs  they are recorded in the depletable pool of proved properties or in unproved properties  collectively  the full cost pool 
unproved property costs are not subject to depletion 
we review our unproved oil and natural gas property costs on a quarterly basis to assess possible impairment or the need to transfer unproved costs to proved properties as a result of extension or discoveries from drilling operations 
we expect these costs to be evaluated in one to seven years and transferred to the depletable portion of the full cost pool during that time 
the full cost pool is comprised of intangible drilling costs  lease and well equipment and exploration and development costs incurred plus costs of acquired proved and unproved leaseholds 
during april we initiated leasing projects to acquire shale drilling rights in both the johnson branch and bethany longstreet fields in our northeast louisiana operating areas 
in accordance with our policy and fasb asc subtopic for capitalization of interest  we began capitalizing interest on unproved properties 
we calculate depletion using the unit of production method 
under this method  the sum of the full cost pool and all estimated future development costs are divided by the total quantity of proved reserves 
this rate is applied to our total production for the period  and the appropriate expense is recorded 
we capitalize the portion of general and administrative costs  including share based compensation that is attributable to our acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development activities 

table of contents under the full cost method of accounting  sales  dispositions and other oil and natural gas property retirements are generally accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool  with no recognition of gain or loss unless the disposition would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
gain or loss recognition on divestiture or abandonment of oil and natural gas properties where disposition would result in a significant alteration of the depletion rate requires allocation of a portion of the amortizable full cost pool based on the relative estimated fair value of the disposed oil and natural gas properties to the estimated fair value of total proved reserves 
as discussed under estimates of proved reserves  estimating oil and natural gas reserves involves numerous assumptions 
prior to our december  adoption of release no 
 at the end of each quarterly period the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  net of related deferred income taxes  was limited to the full cost ceiling  computed as the sum of the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves using period end prices  discounted at  and adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
in the event our capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling limitation at the end of the reporting period  we subsequently evaluated the limitation for price changes occurring after the balance sheet date to assess impairment 
beginning december   release no 
requires that the full cost ceiling be computed as the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves using the average  first day of the month price during the previous month period  discounted at and adjusted for related income tax effects 
the new rule no longer allows a company to subsequently evaluate the limitation for subsequent prices changes 
under full cost accounting rules  any ceiling test write downs of oil and natural gas properties may not be reversed in subsequent periods 
the quarterly calculation of the ceiling test is based upon estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain significant estimates management s estimates of oil and gas reserves are based on various assumptions  including constant oil and gas prices 
it is reasonably possible that a future event in the near term could cause the estimates to change and such changes could have a severe impact 
actual future production  cash flows  taxes  operating expenses  development expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations  which may be substantial  in the estimated reserves 
while it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates above will change materially in the near term  no estimate can be made of the range of possible changes that might occur 
asset retirement obligations we follow fasb asc subtopic for asset retirement obligations to account for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
asc requires these obligations be recognized at their estimated fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost should be capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful 
table of contents life of the asset 
the costs of plugging and abandoning oil and natural gas properties fluctuate with costs associated with the industry 
we periodically assess the estimated costs of our asset retirement obligations and adjust the liability according to these estimates 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting in accordance with fasb asc topic for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates related to the reversal of temporary differences  and actual results could vary from those estimates 
deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax benefits and consequences of future years differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments to employees using the methodology prescribed in fasb asc topic for stock compensation 
asc topic requires share based compensation to be recorded with cost classifications consistent with cash compensation 
subsequent events in may  the fasb issued new authoritative guidance for subsequent events 
such authoritative guidance establishes general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
reductions in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our acquisition and development activities 
to date  we have not entered into futures contracts or other hedging agreements to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of our production 
interest rate risk as of june   we had  of long term debt outstanding under our credit facility  which matures on july   and the wallen note  which matures on september  this debt bears interest at the prime rate plus for the credit facility and prime rate plus for the wallen note 
as a result  our interest costs fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
based on the aforementioned borrowings outstanding at june   a basis point change in interest rates would change our annual interest expense by approximately  we had no interest rate derivatives during fiscal
