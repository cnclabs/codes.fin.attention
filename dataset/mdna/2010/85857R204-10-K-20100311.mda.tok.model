overview the company we are engaged in researching  developing  and commercializing stem cell therapeutics and enabling technologies for stem cell based research and drug discovery and development 
our research and development r d programs are primarily focused on our cellular medicine programs  where we are engaged in identifying and developing potential cell based therapeutics which can either restore or support organ function 
in particular  since we relocated our corporate headquarters to california in  our r d efforts have been directed at refining our methods for identifying  isolating  culturing  and purifying the human neural stem cell and human liver engrafting cells hlec and developing these as potential cell based therapeutics for the central nervous system cns and the liver  respectively 
in our cns program  our hucns sc product candidate purified human neural stem cells is currently in clinical development for two indications neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  a lysomal storage disorder often referred to as batten disease  and pelizeaus merzbacher disease pmd  a myelination disorder in the brain 
we have completed a six patient phase i clinical trial in infantile and late infantile ncl 
the data from this trial showed that the hucns sc cells were well tolerated and there was evidence of engraftment and long term survival of the hucns sc cells 
in november  we met with the fda to review the results our phase i trial in ncl and to discuss our proposed clinical development plans 
during this meeting  the fda acknowledged our position that the risk benefit profile shown by the phase i data merits further clinical evaluation of hucns sc cells in ncl 
we continue to be in discussions with the fda regarding our plans for a second clinical trial in ncl  although there can be no assurance when or if such a trial will be initiated 
also in november  we initiated a phase i clinical trial to assess the safety and preliminary effectiveness of hucns sc cells as a treatment for pmd 
in february  we enrolled and treated the first patient in this trial  and we expect it will take months to 
table of contents complete enrollment 
in addition to these clinical development activities  our hucns sc cells are in preclinical development for spinal cord injury and retinal disorders 
in our liver program  we are in preclinical development with our human liver engrafting cells 
we have decided to defer initiating a clinical study of hlec pending additional improvements to our process of isolating and purifying hlec 
for a brief description of our significant therapeutic research and development programs see overview research and development programs in the business section of part i  item of this form k 
we have also conducted research on several other cell types and in other areas  which could lead to other possible product candidates  process improvements or further research activities 
we are also engaged in developing and commercializing applications of our technologies to enable research  which we believe represent nearer term commercial opportunities 
our portfolio of technologies includes cell technologies relating to embryonic stem cells  induced pluripotent stem ips cells  and tissue derived adult stem cells  expertise and infrastructure for providing cell based assays for drug discovery  a cell culture products business  and an intellectual property portfolio with claims relevant to cell processing  reprogramming and manipulation  as well as to gene targeting and insertion 
much of our these enabling technologies were acquired in april as part of our acquisition of the operations of stem cell sciences plc scs 
see note  acquisition of scs operations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of any products except for license revenue for certain of our patented cells and sales of cell culture products for use in research 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenue from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations 
we have no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenue will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our therapeutic product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial in vitro testing and characterization of our proprietary cell types  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  iii develop  validate and scale up manufacturing processes to produce these cell based therapeutics  and iv obtain required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
overall  we expect our r d expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future product candidates 
however  expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our product candidates with a partner or independently 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our current product candidates will be subject to future collaboration  when such collaboration agreements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
in addition  there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our cell based therapeutics  including future trial design and regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time given the stage of our development and the novel nature of stem cell technologies 
the regulatory pathways  both in the united states and internationally  are complex and fluid given the novel and  in general  clinically unproven nature of stem cell technologies 
at this time  due to such uncertainties and inherent risks  we cannot estimate in a meaningful way the duration of  or the costs to complete  our r d programs or whether  when or to what extent we will generate revenues or cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our therapeutic product candidates 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical prospects of each product candidate  as well as our ongoing assessment of the regulatory requirements and each product candidate s commercial potential 
given the early stage of development of our therapeutic product candidates  any estimates of when we may be able to commercialize one or more of these products would not be meaningful 
moreover  any estimate of the time and investment required to develop potential products based upon our proprietary hucns sc and hlec technologies will change depending on the ultimate approach or approaches we take to pursue them  the results of 
table of contents preclinical and clinical studies  and the content and timing of decisions made by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop any product successfully  or that we will be able to recover our development costs  whether upon commercialization of a developed product or otherwise 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these programs will result in products that can be marketed or marketed profitably 
if certain of our development stage programs do not result in commercially viable products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the research markets served by our enabling technologies are highly competitive  complex and dynamic 
technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in biological research  and stem cell technologies have been evolving particularly fast 
we compete mainly by focusing on specialty media products and cell based assays  which are custom designed for use in stem cell based research  where we believe our expertise  intellectual property and reputation give us competitive advantage 
we believe that  in this particular market niche  our products and technologies offer customers specific advantages over those offered by our competitors 
we compete by offering innovative  quality controlled products  consistently made and designed to produce reproducible results 
we continue to make investments in research and development  quality management  quality improvement  and product innovation 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues from the sale of specialty cell culture products of approximately  we can give no assurances that we will be able to continue to generate such revenues in the future 
significant events cellular medicine clinical development in january  we completed our phase i clinical trial of hucns sc cells in infantile and late infantile ncl also often referred to as batten disease 
in june  we announced positive results from our ncl trial 
this phase i trial was designed primarily to assess the safety of hucns sc cells as a potential cell based therapeutic 
overall  the trial data demonstrated that the hucns sc cells  the transplantation procedure and the immunosuppression regimen were well tolerated by all six patients enrolled in the trial  and that the patients medical  neurological and neuropsychological conditions  following transplantation  appeared consistent with the normal course of the disease 
in addition to this favorable safety profile  we reported evidence of engraftment and long term survival of the hucns sc cells 
in november  we met with the fda to review the results of our ncl trial and to discuss our proposed clinical development plans 
during this meeting  the fda acknowledged our position that the risk benefit profile shown by the phase i data merits further clinical evaluation of hucns sc cells in ncl 
we continue to be in discussions with the fda regarding our plans for a second ncl trial 
in november  we initiated a phase i clinical trial designed to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of our hucns sc cells in pmd 
this study  which is the second clinical trial of our hucns sc cells in a neurodegenerative disease  is being conducted at the university of california  san francisco ucsf 
in february  we enrolled and treated the first patient in our pmd trial at ucsf  marking the first time that neural stem cells have been transplanted as a potential treatment for a myelination disorder 
we expect it will take months to complete enrollment in this trial 
cellular medicine preclinical development in may  our collaborators at oregon health science university ohsu casey eye institute presented data at the association for research in vision and ophthalmology annual meeting showing that our human neural stem cells  when transplanted into an animal model of retinal degeneration  engraft long term and protect the retina from progressive degeneration 
retinal degeneration leads to loss of vision in diseases such as age related macular degeneration 
in september  our preclinical data demonstrating proof of concept of our hucns sc cells in ncl was published in the peer reviewed journal cell stem cell 
our human neural stem cells  when transplanted in a mouse 
table of contents model of infantile ncl  were shown to engraft  migrate throughout the brain and continuously secrete the missing lysosomal enzyme characteristic of ncl 
moreover  mice transplanted with our neural stem cells showed statistically significant reduction in cellular waste build up  protection of critical host neurons and delayed loss of motor function compared with the control non transplanted group 
in september  we received ethics committee approval at the universit catholique de louvain ucl in belgium to initiate a clinical study evaluating hlec as a potential cellular therapy for liver based metabolic disorders 
however  we have decided to defer initiating a clinical study of our hlec cells pending additional refinements to our process of isolating and purifying these cells 
in october  our collaborators at ohsu casey eye institute presented preclinical data showing that our human neural stem cells  when transplanted into an animal model of retinal degeneration  protect cone photoreceptors cones in the eye from progressive degeneration and preserve visual function long term 
cones are light sensing cells that are highly concentrated within the macula of the human eye 
the ability to protect these cells suggests a promising approach to treating age related macular degeneration  the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over the age of these findings were presented at the society for neuroscience annual meeting 
enabling technologies in april  we closed the acquisition of the operations of scs for  shares of our common stock and approximately  in cash 
as a result  we acquired proprietary cell technologies relating to embryonic stem cells  induced pluripotent stem cells  and tissue derived adult stem cells  expertise and infrastructure for providing cell based assays for drug discovery  the sc proven cell culture business  an intellectual property portfolio with claims relevant to cell processing  reprogramming and manipulation  as well as to gene targeting and insertion  and a european presence with operations in cambridge  uk in september  we announced organizational initiatives focused on growing our sc proven cell culture products business and advancing the development and commercialization of cell based assay platforms for use in drug discovery and development 
these initiatives included new personnel appointments and a realignment of activities within our cambridge  uk and palo alto  california locations  as well as the wind down of our operations in melbourne  australia 
in january  we launched gs r  the first commercially available medium to enable the derivation  maintenance and growth of true germline competent rat embryonic stem cells 
gs r is expected to have significant utility in the creation of genetically engineered rat models of human disease for use in academic  medical and pharmaceutical research 
in february  we launched gs m  a new cell culture medium that enables the derivation and long term maintenance of true mouse ips cells 
gs m has been shown to increase the efficiency of reprogramming pre ips cells to derive fully pluripotent stem cells  and to maintain mouse ips cells in a pluripotent state in long term culture 
intellectual property and licensing activities in april  we announced that a major international pharmaceutical company acquired a non exclusive license to our internal ribosome entry site ires technology 
the ires technology enables researchers to genetically modify any mammalian cell and to monitor the activity of a particular gene of interest without blocking the normal function of the gene 
the ires technology is particularly important for evaluating the success of gene knock outs or knock ins in stem cells  as well as for the successful creation of transgenic mouse and rat disease models 
in may  the us patent and trademark office pto upheld the validity of our two remaining neural stem cell patents that were subjected to reexamination proceedings commenced by neuralstem  inc the decision by the pto to uphold the two patents is final and cannot be appealed 
a total of five patents were reexamined in proceedings requested by neuralstem  and the validity of all five has been upheld by the pto 
four of the upheld patents are the subject of litigation initiated by us against neuralstem 
in this case  we allege against neuralstem 
table of contents various unfair competition torts and infringement of a total of six patents 
these six patents collectively claim the manufacture and use of human neural stem and progenitor cells as tools for drug discovery and as therapeutic agents 
in august  the court approved a scheduling order for discovery and trial 
in december  we received a notice of allowance and a notice of issuance from the pto for two patents claiming technologies for the establishment and maintenance of cell pluripotency  including the reprogramming of cells to create pluripotent stem cells 
these patents strengthen our intellectual property position in both the embryonic stem cell and ips cell fields 
financing and stock related activities in june  we were added to the russell index  a broad market index that measures the performance of the largest companies in the united states 
we are also included in the russell index  which is a subset of the russell representing the small capitalization segment of the us equity market 
in november  we raised gross proceeds of  through the sale of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the common stock and warrants were sold in units  with each unit consisting of i one share of common stock and ii a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock at an exercise price of per share  and the purchase price was per unit 
we received total proceeds  net of offering expenses and placement agency fees  of approximately  critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we have established internal controls related to the preparation of these estimates 
actual results and the timing of the results could differ materially from these estimates 
warrant liability authoritative accounting guidance prescribes that warrants issued under contracts that could require net cash settlement should be classified as liabilities and contracts that only provide for settlement in shares should be classified as equity 
in order for a contract to be classified as equity  specific conditions must be met 
these conditions are intended to identify situations in which net cash settlement could be forced upon the issuer 
as part of both our november and november financings  we issued warrants with five year terms to purchase  and  shares of our common stock at and per share  respectively 
as the contracts include the possibility of net cash settlement  we are required to classify the fair value of the warrants issued as a liability  with subsequent changes in fair value to be recorded as income loss on change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility  the contractual term  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term of the warrants is based on the time to expiration of the warrants from the date of measurement 
risk free interest rates are derived from the yield on us treasury debt securities 
we will continue to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability until the warrants are exercised  expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability 
the estimated fair value of our warrant liability  at december   was approximately  stock based compensation us gaap requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options and restricted stock units 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at 
table of contents the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
for the year ended december   employee stock based compensation expense was approximately  as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units not yet recognized was approximately  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 
wind down expenses rhode island in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters and remaining research laboratories to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  we are seeking to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interest in the facility at the earliest possible time  but we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates  and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking into account changes  if any  in each of the underlying factors 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections into time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 
management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the lease to arrive at the present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility over the last seven years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be approximately for  and approximately from through the end of the lease 
these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
if the assumed vacancy rate for to the end of the lease had been five percentage points higher or lower at december   then the reserve would have increased or decreased by approximately  similarly  a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility from on would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  and a increase or decrease in the assumed average rental charge per square foot would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve  net of subtenant income  of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned above  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve to  at december  by recording an additional  as wind down expenses for the year ended december  australia on april   as part of our acquisition of the scs operations  we acquired certain operations near melbourne  australia 
in order to reduce operating complexity and expenses  we made the decision to close our site in australia and consolidate personnel and programs to our cambridge  uk and palo alto  california sites 
at june   we established a reserve of approximately  for the estimated costs to close down and exit our australia operations 
the reserve reflects the estimated cost to terminate our facility lease in australia which provided for an original termination date of december   employee termination benefits and other liabilities associated with the wind down and relocation of our operations in australia 
as of december   the facility lease agreement has been terminated and our operations in australia have been relocated to cambridge  uk and palo alto  california 
we recorded actual expenses of approximately  against this reserve 
we believe that the estimated remaining balance of approximately  in our reserve will be sufficient to cover any remaining exit costs 
income taxes when accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of part ii  item of this form k for further information on these matters 

table of contents results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our rhode island facilities  other than temporary impairment of our financial assets  changes in estimated fair value of our warrant liability  and the increasing costs associated with operating our california and cambridge  uk facilities  and engaging in and expanding our operations

clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
cumulative r d costs incurred since we refocused our activities on developing cell based therapeutics fiscal years through were approximately million 
over this period  the majority of these cumulative costs were related to i characterization of our proprietary hucns sc cell  ii expenditures for toxicology and other preclinical studies  preparation and submission of applications to regulatory agencies to conduct clinical trials and obtaining regulatory clearance to initiate such trials  all with respect to our hucns sc cells  iii preclinical studies and development of our human liver engrafting cells  and iv costs associated with cell processing and process development 
we use and manage our r d resources  including our employees and facilities  across various projects rather than on a project by project basis for the following reasons 
the allocations of time and resources change as the needs and priorities of individual projects and programs change  and many of our researchers are assigned to more than one project at any given time 
furthermore  we are exploring multiple possible uses for each of our proprietary cell types  so much of our r d effort is complementary to and supportive of each of these projects 
lastly  much of our r d effort is focused on manufacturing processes  which can result in process improvements useful across cell types 
we also use external service providers to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials  to manufacture certain of our product candidates and to provide various other r d related products and services 
many of these costs and expenses are complementary to and supportive of each of our programs 
because we do not have a development collaborator for any of our product programs  we are currently responsible for all costs incurred with respect to our product candidates

the reserve inclusive of deferred rent was approximately  at december  and  at december  payments net of subtenant income were recorded against this reserve of  in   in  and  in we re evaluated the estimate and adjusted the reserve by recording  in aggregate  additional wind down expenses of  in   in  and  in expenses for this facility will fluctuate based on changes in tenant occupancy rates and other operating expenses related to the lease 
even though it is our intent to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interests in the facility at the earliest possible time  we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur 
in light of this uncertainty  based on estimates  we will periodically re evaluate and adjust the reserve  as necessary

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and proceeds from equity and debt offerings  proceeds from the transfer or sale of our intellectual property rights  equipment  facilities or investments  and government grants and funding from collaborative arrangements  if obtainable  to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through equity and debt financings  grants and collaborative research arrangements 
on june  we filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement  declared effective july   which permits us to issue up to million worth of registered debt and equity securities 
under this effective shelf registration  we have the flexibility to issue registered securities from time to time  in one or more separate offerings or other transactions  with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
registered securities issued using this shelf may be used to raise additional capital to fund our working capital and other corporate needs  for future acquisitions of assets  programs or businesses  and for other corporate purposes

in july  we deregistered the remaining unissued shares approximately million worth of common stock available under the shelf registration statement we had filed in october the shelf permitted the issuance of up to million of registered shares of common stock 
also in july  we amended our sales agreement with cantor to allow for sales under our universal shelf registration rather than the shelf registration 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties 
in addition  the decline in economic activity  together with the deterioration of the credit and capital markets  could have an adverse impact on potential sources of future financing

indemnification agreement in july  we amended our and license agreements with neurospheres 
neurospheres is the holder of certain patents exclusively licensed by us  including the six patents that are the basis of our patent infringement suits against neuralstem 
as part of the amendment  we agreed to pay all reasonable litigation costs  expenses and attorney s fees incurred by neurospheres in the declaratory judgment suit between us and neuralstem 
in return  we are entitled to off set all litigation costs incurred in that suit against amounts that would otherwise be owed under the license agreements  such as annual maintenance fees  milestones and royalty payments 
at this time  we cannot estimate the likely total costs of our pending litigation with neuralstem  given the unpredictable nature of such proceedings  or the total amount we may ultimately owe under the neurospheres license agreements 
however  the ability to apply the offsets will run for the entire term of each license agreement 
the estimated balance for future offsets is included under other assets  non current on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have concluded that the estimated balance of  as of december  is a fair estimate and realizable against future milestone and royalty payments to neurospheres  and that litigation costs incurred after december  will be expensed as incurred 
management will reevaluate this estimate on a quarterly basis based on actual costs and other relevant factors

adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity under the caption unrealized loss on foreign currency translation 
a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar in relation to the gbp would have resulted in an approximate  increase in our net loss reported for the year ended december  because we are currently not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk with respect to revenue transactions and cash balances  we have not to date entered into any hedging contracts
