within the north america broadband segment  sales are attributed to the consumer group  which delivers broadband internet service to consumer customers  and the enterprise group  which provides satellite  wire line and wireless communication networks and services to enterprises 
the international broadband segment consists of our international service companies and services sold directly to international enterprise customers 
the international enterprise group provides managed networks services and equipment to enterprise customers and broadband service providers worldwide 
the telecom systems segment consists of the mobile satellite systems group  the telematics group  and the terrestrial microwave group 
the mobile satellite systems group provides turnkey satellite ground segment systems to mobile system operators

the corporate and other segment includes our wholly owned subsidiaries electronic system products  inc and rare medium  llc  certain minority interest investments held by us  our corporate offices and assets not specifically related to another business segment 
due to the complementary nature and common architecture of our services and products across our business segments  we are able to leverage our expertise and resources within our various operating units to yield significant cost efficiencies 
revenues we generate revenues from the sale and financing of hardware and the provision of services 
in our north america and international broadband segments  we generate revenues from services and hardware 
in our telecom systems segment  we generate revenues primarily from the development and sale of hardware 
some of our enterprise customers purchase equipment separately and operate their own networks 
these customers include large enterprises  incumbent local exchange carriers  governmental agencies and resellers 
contracts for our services vary in length depending on the customers requirements

we have the ability to integrate these service offerings to provide comprehensive solutions for our customers 
we also provide managed services to our customers who operate their own dedicated network facilities and charge them a management fee for the operation and support of their networks 
hardware we offer our enterprise customers the option to purchase their equipment up front or to finance the sale through a third party leasing company as part of their service agreement under which payments are made over a fixed term 
our consumer customers have the option to purchase the equipment up front or  beginning in september  to rent the equipment with a month service contract 
prior to september  we offered our consumer customers the option to pay for the purchased equipment over a month period 
hardware revenues of the north american and international enterprise groups are derived from i network operating centers  ii radio frequency terminals earth stations  iii vsat components including indoor units  outdoor units  and antennas  iv voice  video and data appliances  v routers and dsl modems  and vi system integration services to integrate all of the above into a system

vs 
amount amount churn rate arpu average monthly gross subscriber additions subscribers north america broadband segment revenue from our consumer group for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to the same period in the growth in our consumer group has been driven primarily by two factors i the substantial growth in the number of subscribers arising from increased consumer awareness of our products and services in geographic areas that have historically been underserved by dsl and cable and ii value added services  resulting in an increase in average monthly revenue per subscriber 

table of contents as of december  and  we achieved a total subscription base of  and  respectively  which included  and  subscribers in our small medium enterprise and wholesale businesses  respectively 
for the year ended december   our arpu was compared to for the same period in arpu is used to measure average monthly consumer subscription service revenues on a per subscriber basis 
our arpu calculation may not be consistent with other companies calculation in the same or similar businesses as we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating arpu 
revenue from our north american enterprise group for the year ended december  decreased by to million compared to the same period in  primarily due to lower hardware sales as a result of the unfavorable condition of the overall market and economy  as well as changes in the product mix where the emphasis on managed services has led to lower upfront hardware revenue and an increase in recurring service revenues 
the decrease in hardware sales was partially offset by the increase in services revenues resulting from an increase in our managed services business  new contracts awarded in that provided incremental service revenue in and the growth in our small medium and wholesale subscriber base 
international broadband segment revenue from our international enterprise group for the year ended december  decreased by to million compared to the same period in  primarily due to the completion of terminal shipments on a multi year contract for a large lottery operator in the united kingdom and the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates of million resulting from the appreciation of the us dollar 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher revenues from our mexico operations and from our brazil operations as the number of sites in service in brazil approached  as of december  telecom systems segment revenue from our telecom systems segment for the year ended december  decreased by to million compared to the same period in  primarily due to the reduction in revenue from our mobile satellite group 
our mobile satellite group revenues are opportunity driven and are subject to the life cycle of customer contracts as they move from design and development to delivery and maintenance of completed networks 
as a result  revenues in the mobile satellite group fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis 
additionally  the decrease was impacted by the unfavorable economy in the automobile industry causing hti to terminate substantially all of the development engineering and manufacturing services with us in august as a result of the bankruptcy filing of one of hti s customers 
we expect our future revenue from the telematics group to be insignificant 
revenue backlog at december   and  our total revenue backlog  which we define as our expected future revenue under customer contracts that are non cancelable and excluding consumer customers  was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to realize our revenue backlog as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
see item a 
risk factors and special note regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the potential risks to our revenue and backlog 
although we have signed contracts with our consumer customers for months  we do not include these contractual commitments in our backlog 
cost of services our cost of services primarily consist of transponder capacity leases  hub infrastructure  customer care  wire line and wireless capacity  depreciation expense related to network infrastructure and capitalized hardware and software  and the salaries and related employment costs for those employees who manage our network operations and other project areas 
these costs are dependent on the number of customers served and have increased relative to our growth 
we continue to execute a number of cost containment and efficiency initiatives that were implemented in previous years 
in addition  the migration to a single upgraded platform for our north america broadband segment has enabled us to leverage our satellite bandwidth and network operation facilities to achieve further cost efficiencies 
the costs associated with transponder capacity leases for the consumer group are expected to decline as more customers are added to the spaceway network 

table of contents cost of hardware products sold we outsource a significant portion of the manufacturing of our hardware for our north america and international broadband and telecom systems segments to third party contract manufacturers 
our cost of hardware products sold relates primarily to direct materials and subsystems eg  antennas  salaries and related employment costs for those employees who are directly associated with the procurement and manufacture of our products and other items of indirect overhead incurred in the procurement and production process 
cost of hardware products sold also includes certain engineering and hardware costs related to the design of a particular product for specific customer programs 
in addition  certain software development costs are capitalized in accordance with asc  costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and amortized to cost of hardware products sold over their estimated useful lives  not to exceed five years 
as we have developed new product offerings  we have reduced product costs due to higher levels of component integration  design improvements and volume increases 
subscriber acquisition costs sac are associated with our consumer group and are comprised of three elements i the subsidy for the cost of hardware and related installation  ii certain sales and marketing expense  and iii dealer and customer service representative commissions on new installations activations 
the subsidy for cost of hardware and related cost of installation is deferred and amortized over the initial contract period or the useful life of the hardware as a component of cost of hardware products sold for hardware related sales or cost of services for activities related to the consumer rental program

table of contents although the terms and covenants with respect to the senior notes are substantially identical to the senior notes  the senior notes were issued under a separate indenture and do not vote together with the senior notes 
each of the indentures governing the senior notes and senior notes collectively  the senior notes  the agreement governing the amended revolving credit facility and the agreement governing the term loan facility require hns to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants i in the case of the indentures  for so long as any senior notes are outstanding  ii in the case of the amended revolving credit facility  for so long as the amended revolving credit facility is in effect  and iii in the case of the term loan facility  for so long as the term loan facility remains outstanding

in february  we completed the acquisition of helius  inc in connection with the merger agreement that we entered into on december  the merger agreement with helius  inc  utah acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  and the canopy group  inc and canopy ventures i  lp  the primary shareholders of helius  inc pursuant to the merger agreement  we paid million after certain adjustments at the closing of the acquisition 
immediately after the acquisition  helius  inc was converted to a limited liability company  helius  llc helius 
as part of the merger agreement  we had a contractual obligation for contingent consideration of up to million contingent payment as additional purchase price  if any  to be payable in april by us or helius  subject to helius achieving certain post closing performance goals 
as of december   helius did not meet the performance goals as set forth in the merger agreement

table of contents securities of hns and hns finance corp  as co issuers 
in the event hns issues debt securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we will  and one or more of our other subsidiaries may  on a joint and several basis  offer full and unconditional guarantees of hns and hns finance corp 
s obligations under the debt securities 
in may  we made an equity offering to sell  shares of our common stock  par value per share for a purchase price of per share  prior to deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions 
as a result of the equity offering  we raised million  net of the underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses  which will be used for the acquisition of a satellite or general corporate purposes 
in july  we entered into an agreement with west co  inc west co 
and its parent  miraxis license holdings  llc mlh  pursuant to which west co 
and mlh agreed to provide a series of coordination agreements allowing the company to operate spaceway at the west longitude orbital slot where west co

our remaining obligations with west co 
as of december  are subject to conditions in the agreement including our ability to operate spaceway  and are as follows million for the year ending december  and million for each of the years ending december  through in june  hns entered into an agreement with ss l  under which ss l will manufacture our jupiter satellite 
jupiter will employ a multi spot beam  bent pipe ka band architecture and will provide additional capacity for the hughesnet service in north america 
we are obligated to pay an aggregate of approximately million for the construction of jupiter and have agreed to make payment to ss l in installments upon the completion of each milestone as set forth in the agreement 
we anticipate launching jupiter in the first half of in connection with the construction of jupiter  we have entered into a contract with barrett  whereby barrett has agreed to lease or acquire user beams  gateways and terminals for the jupiter satellite that are designed to operate in canada 
based on our current and anticipated levels of operations and conditions in our markets and industry  we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will enable us to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  research and development  remaining ground infrastructure expenditures for spaceway  new acquisitions  initial milestone payments for development of our jupiter satellite and  to a lesser extent  other on going capital and operating expenditures 
however  our ability to fund these needs and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions  the level of spending by our customers and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
any future acquisitions  joint ventures  acquisition of a satellite  or other similar transactions will likely require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all

commitments and contingencies for a discussion of commitments and contingencies  see note commitments and contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we are required to issue standby letters of credit and bonds primarily to support certain sales of our equipment to international government customers 
these letters of credit are either bid bonds to support contract bids or to support advance payments made by customers upon contract execution and prior to equipment being shipped  or guarantees of performance issued in support of its warranty obligations 
bid bonds typically expire upon the issue of the award by the customer 
advance payment bonds expire upon receipt by the customer of equipment  and performance bonds typically expire when the warranty expires  generally one year after the installation of the equipment 
as of december   we had million of contractual obligations to customers and other statutory governmental agencies  which were secured by letters of credit issued through us and our subsidiaries credit facilities 
of this amount  million was issued under the revolving credit facility  million was secured by restricted cash  million related to insurance bonds  and million was secured by letters of credit issued under credit arrangements available to our indian and brazilian subsidiaries 
certain letters of credit issued by our indian subsidiaries are secured by their assets 
seasonality like many communications infrastructure equipment vendors  a significant amount of our hardware sales occur in the second half of the year due to our customers annual procurement and budget cycles 
large enterprises and operators usually allocate their capital expenditure budgets at the beginning of their fiscal year which often coincides with the calendar year 
the typical sales cycle for large complex system procurements is to months  which often results in the customer expenditure occurring towards the end of the year 
customers often seek to expend the budgeted funds prior to the end of the year and the next budget cycle 
as a result  interim results are not indicative of the results to be expected for the full year 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
certain relationships and related transactions for a discussion of related party transactions  see note transactions with related parties to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
table of contents period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition service revenues and hardware sales  excluding lease revenues described below  are recognized when services are rendered or products are installed and as title passes to those customers  net of sales taxes 
in situations where customer offerings represent a bundled arrangement for both services and hardware  revenue elements are separated into their relevant components services or hardware for revenue recognition purposes 
we offer a rebate to qualifying new consumer subscribers and record a reduction in revenue in the same period the related sale occurs based on an estimate of the number of rebates that will be redeemed 
this estimate is based on historical experience and actual sales during the promotion 
in addition to providing standard product and service offerings  we also enter into contracts to design  develop and deliver telecommunication networks to customers 
these contracts for telecommunication networks require significant effort to develop and construct the network  over an extended time period 
revenues are also earned from long term contracts for the sale of mobile satellite communications systems 
sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting 
under this method  sales are recorded equivalent to costs incurred plus a portion of the profit expected to be realized  determined based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
profits expected to be realized on long term contracts are based on estimates of total sales value and costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the revisions are made 
estimated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they are identified 
business combinations and intangible assets we have participated in several significant transactions that have impacted our financial statements 
we account for business combinations in accordance with the asc  business combinations 
the acquisition of businesses is an element of our business strategy 
under the purchase method  we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s financial statements 
intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations which have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on estimates of the period during which the assets are expected to generate revenue 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may no longer be recoverable 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining provisions for income taxes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and where applicable  record a valuation allowance to reduce the total deferred tax assets to amounts that will  more likely than not  be realized in the future 
our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax assets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence  including the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted taxable income from operating activities 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment 
in the event that actual taxable income from operating activities differs from forecasted amounts  or if we change our estimates of forecasted taxable income 
table of contents from operating activities  we could record additional charges in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their realizable amounts 
such charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we also review our positions taken or that will be taken on the income tax returns for unrecognized tax benefits  assess whether such unrecognized tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold  and determine the need to record a liability in accordance with asc  income taxes  along with any penalty and interest 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations  domestically and internationally 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our determination of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax assessments are probable and estimable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is less than we originally expected  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
subscriber acquisition costs sac our consumer group  included in the north america broadband segment  offers internet and data networking services to consumers and small medium businesses in north america 
the products and services are sold to customers using a variety of competitive service packages  through an extensive independent nationwide network of distributors  dealers  sales agents and retail companies 
sac is an important component of our cost to acquire new consumer subscribers 
sac consists of dealer and customer service representative commissions on new installations and  in certain cases  the cost of hardware and installation provided to customers at the inception of service or cost of services for activities related to the consumer rental program 
sac is deferred when a customer commits to a service agreement  and the deferred sac is amortized over the commitment period as the related service revenue is earned 
prior to  service agreements were to months in duration 
in may  we began to offer only month service agreements 
customers who receive hardware and installation under these service agreements have a higher monthly service rate than is charged to customers who purchase their equipment outright at the inception of service 
we monitor the recoverability of subscriber acquisition costs and are entitled to an early termination fee secured by customer credit card information if the subscriber cancels service prior to the end of the commitment period 
the recoverability of deferred subscriber acquisition costs is reasonably assured through the increased monthly service fee charged to customers  the ability to recover the equipment  and or the ability to charge an early termination fee

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses referred to below include forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market conditions may occur 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions because the amounts noted below are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof 
accordingly  you should not consider the forward looking statements as projections by us of future events or losses 
general our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and changes in the market value of our equity investments 
we manage our exposure to those market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we enter into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives and do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we generally conduct our business in united states dollars 
however  as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies  it is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december   we had an estimated million of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables outstanding  of which million had hedge contracts in place to partially mitigate foreign currency risk 
the differences between the face amount of the foreign exchange contracts and their estimated fair values were not material as of december  the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates on the fair value of foreign currency denominated net assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries would be an estimated loss of million as of december  marketable securities risk we have a significant amount of cash that is invested in marketable securities which is subject to market risk due to interest rate fluctuations 
we have established an investment policy which governs our investment strategy and stipulates that we diversify investments among united states treasury securities and other high credit quality debt instruments that we believe to be low risk 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
interest rate risk hns senior notes and outstanding borrowings related to very small aperture terminal hardware financing arrangements are not subject to interest rate fluctuations because the interest rate is fixed for the term of the instrument 
we are subject to variable interest rates on certain other debt including the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility 
to the extent we draw against the credit facility  increases in interest rates would have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
to mitigate the variable interest rate risk associated with the term loan facility  we entered into the swap agreement to swap the variable libor based interest on the term loan facility for a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the net interest payments based on the swap agreement and the term loan facility are paid 
table of contents quarterly and estimated to be approximately million for each of the years ending december  through and million for the year ending december  the security for our interest obligation under the swap agreement is the same as the security for the revolving credit facility described in note debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
market concentration and credit risk we provide services and extend credit to a number of equipment customers  service providers  and a large number of consumers  both in the united states and around the world 
we monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain  as necessary  allowances for anticipated losses 
financial instruments which potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments 
although we maintain cash balances at financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits  these balances are placed with high credit quality financial institutions 
commodity price risk all of our products contain components whose base raw materials have undergone dramatic cost fluctuations in the last months 
fluctuations in pricing of raw materials have the ability to affect our product costs 
although we have been successful in offsetting or mitigating our exposure to these fluctuations  such changes could have an adverse impact on our product costs 
we are unable to predict the possible impact of changes in commodity prices
