in order to properly assess the collateral dependent loans included in its loan portfolio  the company has established policies regarding the monitoring of the collateral underlying such loans 
the company requires an appraisal that is less than one year old for all new collateral dependent real estate loans  and all renewed collateral dependent real estate loans where significant new money is extended 
the appraisal process is handled by the credit department  which selects the appraiser and orders the appraisal for commercial loans greater than  first defiance s loan policy prohibits the account officer from talking or communicating with the appraiser to insure that the appraiser is not influenced by the account officer in any way in making their determination of value 
first federal generally does not require updated appraisals for performing loans unless significant new money is requested by the borrower 
when a collateral dependent loan is downgraded to classified status  first federal reviews the most current appraisal on file and if necessary  based on first federal s assessment of the appraisal  such as age  market  etc  first federal will discount this amount to a more appropriate current value based on inputs from lenders and realtors 
this amount may then be discounted further by first federal s estimation of the carrying and selling costs 
in some instances  we may require a new appraisal 
finally  first federal assesses whether there is any collateral short fall  considering guarantor support and determines if a reserve is necessary 
when a collateral dependent loan moves to non performing status  first federal generally gets a new third party appraisal and adjusts the reserve as necessary based upon the new appraisal and an estimate of costs to liquidate the collateral 
all properties that are moved into the other real estate owned oreo category are supported by current appraisals  and the oreo is carried at the appraised value less first federal s estimate of the liquidation costs 
first federal does not adjust any appraisals upward without written documentation of this valuation change from the appraiser 
when setting reserves on classified loans  appraisal values may be discounted downward based upon first federal s experience with liquidating similar properties 
all collateral dependent loans over days past due and or on non accrual as well as all troubled debt restructured collateral dependent loans are classified as non performing loans 
non performing status automatically occurs in the month in which the day delinquency occurs 
for troubled debt restructured collateral dependent loans  the loans are put into non performing status in the month in which the restructure occurs 
as stated above  once a collateral dependent loan is identified as non performing  first federal generally gets an appraisal 
troubled debt restructure collateral dependent loans receive an appraisal as part of the restructure credit decision 

table of contents appraisals are received within approximately days after they are requested 
the first federal loan loss reserve committee reviews the amount of each new appraisal and makes any necessary adjustment to the reserve at its meeting prior to the end of each quarter 
any partially charged off collateral dependent loans are considered non performing  and as such  would need to show an extended period of time with satisfactory payment performance as well as cash flow coverage capability supported by current financial statements before first federal will consider an upgrade to performing status 
if the loan maintains a rate at restructuring that is lower than the market rate for similar credits  the loan will remain classified as troubled debt restructuring until such time as it is paid off or restructured at prevailing rates and terms 
first federal may consider moving the loan to accruing status after six months of satisfactory payment performance 
for loans where first federal determines that an updated appraisal is not necessary  other means are used to verify the value of the real estate  such as recent sales of similar properties on which first federal had loans as well as calls to appraisers  brokers  realtors and investors 
first federal monitors and tracks its reserves quarterly to determine accuracy 
based on these results  changes may occur in the processes used 
the most recent analysis indicates that first federal is within its target range of the ultimate losses on liquidated loans being  on average within  of the specific reserves established for these loans 
loan modifications constitute a troubled debt restructuring if first federal for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
for loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings  first federal either computes the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  it may measure impairment based on the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral even though troubled debt restructurings are not expected to be deemed collateral dependent 
the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the loan is recorded as a valuation allowance 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the estimated probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the loan portfolio 
consideration is given to economic conditions  changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower s ability to pay  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and trends in past due and non performing loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
in addition to extensive in house loan monitoring procedures  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of all commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships that exceed  of aggregate exposure 
management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with these types of loans 
the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable credit losses within the existing loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
the allowance for loan loss is made up of two basic components 
the first component is the specific allowance in which the company sets aside reserves based on the analysis of individual credits 
the second component is the general reserve 
the general reserve is used to record loan loss reserves for groups of homogenous loans in which the company estimates the losses incurred in the portfolios based on quantitative and qualitative factors 
due to the uncertainty of risks in the loan portfolio  the company s judgment on the amount of the allowance necessary to adsorb loans losses is approximate 
table presents the allocation of the specific and general components of the allowance by signification loan types 

table of contents in establishing specific reserves  first federal analyzes all loans on its classified and special mention lists at least quarterly and makes judgments about the risk of loss based on the cash flow of the borrower  the value of any collateral and the financial strength of any guarantor in determining the amount of impairment of individual loans and the specific reserve to be recorded 
for purpose of the general reserve analysis  the loan portfolio is stratified into ten different loan pools based on loan type and by market area to allocate historic loss experience 
the loss experience factor applied to the non impaired loan portfolio was based upon historical losses of the most recent four quarters 
the stratification of the loan portfolio resulted in a quantitative general allowance of million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in the quantitative allowance was due to the increase in the historical loss factors relating to commercial and commercial real estate loans 
in addition to the quantitative analysis  a qualitative analysis is performed each quarter to provide additional general reserves on the non impaired loan portfolio for various factors that have a bearing on its loss content  including but not limited to the following changes in international  national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio changes in the trends of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and changes in trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans changes in the political and regulatory environment changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off and recovery practices changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff changes in the quality and breadth of the loan review process the qualitative analysis at december  indicated a general reserve of million compared with million at december  in light of the continued environment of high unemployment  declining real estate values and sustained economic weakness in the midwest  management feels it is prudent to build the general loan loss reserves 
out of the fifteen counties that represent the footprint of the company  only one county in ohio  ottawa  has seen an improvement in its unemployment rate in the following are the unemployment rates for december and december  except for michigan as november was the latest available 
the unemployment rates in december for the following counties in ohio were  allen  defiance  fulton  hancock  henry  lucas  ottawa  paulding  putnam  seneca  williams and wood  compared to december in allen  defiance  fulton  hancock  henry  lucas  ottawa  paulding  putnam  seneca  williams and wood 
the company operates in two counties in michigan  hillsdale and lenawee 
the unemployment rate in hillsdale county was in november 
table of contents compared to in december and the unemployment rate in lenawee county was in november compared to in december the company operates in one county in indiana  allen  which had an unemployment rate of in december compared to in december first defiance s general reserve percentages for loans not otherwise classified ranged from for installment loans to for certain mortgage loans and credit cards were 
as a result of the quantitative and qualitative analyses  the company s provision for loan losses for was million  compared to million for the the allowance for loan losses was million and million and represented and of loans  net of undisbursed loan funds and deferred fees and costs  as of december  and december   respectively 
that increase was mainly the result of the deterioration of economic conditions that continued throughout  that started in that posed many challenges for the banking industry 
real estate values have declined and some collateral dependent loans no longer have enough collateral value to support the outstanding balance 
management has expanded its credit monitoring functions even further beyond its traditionally strong focus 
additional asset review functions and more delinquent loan reporting requirements have been added to assist in this monitoring 
management will continually review credit concentrations by the industry and has placed lower limits on lending within certain types of loan categories 
management has also segmented the commercial real estate portfolio to track the general performance of these segments to further refine the predictive process of identifying potential problem loans 
the provision was offset by charge offs of million against specific reserves and million against general reserves and recoveries of  resulting in an increase to the overall allowance for loan loss of million 
in management s opinion  the overall allowance for loan losses of million as of december  is adequate 
management also assesses the value of real estate owned as of the end of each accounting period and recognizes write downs to the value of that real estate in the income statement if conditions dictate 
in  first defiance recorded oreo write downs that totaled million 
these amounts were included in other non interest expense 
management believes that the values recorded at december  for real estate owned and repossessed assets represent the realizable value of such assets 
total classified loans increased to million at december   compared to million at december  at december   a total of million of loans are classified as substandard for which a specific reserve is required 
a total of million in additional credits were classified as substandard at december  for which no reserve is required because of factors such as the level of collateral or the strength of guarantors 
first defiance also has classified million of loans doubtful at december  by contrast  at december   a total of million of loans were classified as substandard for which some level of specific reserve was required and million were classified as substandard which did not require any reserve 
at december   of loans was classified as doubtful 
first defiance s ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared with at december  management monitors collateral values of all loans included on the watch list that are collateral dependent and believes that allowances for those loans at december  are appropriate

high loan to value mortgage loans the majority of first defiance s mortgage loans are collateralized by one to four family residential real estate  have loan to value ratios of or less  and are made to borrowers in good credit standing 
first federal usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan to value is greater than to purchase private mortgage insurance pmi 
management also periodically reviews and monitors the financial viability of its pmi providers 
first federal originates and retains a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios that exceed where pmi is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths 
the loan to value ratios on these loans are generally limited to and exceptions must be approved by first federal s senior loan committee

management believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures assists when comparing results period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner and provides a better measure of results for first defiance s ongoing operations 
a reconciliation of gaap earnings to core earnings is as follows year ended december  in thousands gaap net income one time acquisition related charges tax effect core operating earnings basic earnings per common share gaap core operating earnings diluted earnings per common share gaap core operating earnings net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively

the growth in fee income in is primarily related to the additional accounts acquired in the pavilion acquisition 

table of contents first federal s overdraft privilege program generally provides for the automatic payment of modest overdraft limits on all accounts deemed to be in good standing when the account is accessed using paper based check processing  a teller withdrawal  a point of sale terminal  an ach transaction  or an atm 
to be in good standing  an account must be brought to a positive balance within a day period 
overdraft limits are established for all customers without discrimination using a risk assessment approach for each account classification 
the approach includes a systematic review and evaluation of the normal deposit flows made to each account classification to establish reasonable and prudent negative balance limits that would be routinely repaid by normal  expected and reoccurring deposits 
the risk assessment by portfolio approach assumes a minimal degree of undetermined credit risk associated with unidentified individual accounts that are overdrawn for or more days 
accounts overdrawn for more than days are automatically charged off 
fees are charged as a one time fee per occurrence and the fee charged for an item that is paid is equal to the fee charged for a non sufficient fund item that is returned 
overdrawn balances  net of allowance for losses  are reflected as loans on first defiance s balance sheet 
the fees charged for this service are established based both on the return of processing costs plus a profit  and on the level of fees charged by competitors in the company s market area for similar services 
these fees are considered to be compensation for providing a service to the customer and therefore deemed to be noninterest income rather than interest income 
fee income recorded for the years ending december  and related to the overdraft privilege product  net of adjustments to the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts  were flat at million 
accounts charged off are included in noninterest expense 
the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts was established june  with a balance of  the allowance for uncollectible overdrafts was  at december  and  at december  noninterest income also includes gains  losses and impairment on investment securities

mortgage banking income totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in from attributable to a million increase in the gain on sale of loans  a million positive change in the valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and an increase of  in servicing revenue which was partially offset by an increase of million in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights expense 
the positive change of million in servicing rights valuation adjustments was due to a recapture of million in compared with an impairment charge of million in this was driven by a steady increase in market mortgage rates during this increase in rates decreased the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing rights 
first 
table of contents defiance originated million of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market in compared with million in the primary reason for the increase was the low interest rate environment in the first half of which led to higher refinance activity 
the  decline in mortgage banking income in from was primarily attributable to the impairment charge of million on mortgage servicing rights and an increase of  in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights primarily due to the material decline in long term mortgage rates during the month of december  which caused an increase in prepayment assumptions 
these declines in were mostly offset by a  increase in mortgage servicing fees resulting from a million increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for others and gains from sale of mortgage loans  which increased million in from the interest rate environment that produces increased mortgage origination activity also typically causes increases in mortgage servicing rights amortization and impairment  creating somewhat of a natural hedge in the mortgage banking line of business

noninterest expense  excluding the acquisition related charges in was million 
compensation and benefits decreased  or in to million from million in compensation declined million due to the reduction of approximately full time equivalent positions during the year 
the company has focused on staffing levels and has worked to reduce levels without negatively impacting our level of customer service 
work patterns and volumes did change in due in large part to the economy and lower levels of commercial lending 
this decline was partially offset by an increase of  in medical and other associated costs

compensation and benefits increased by million in compared to  to million from million 
a portion of the increase in compensation from to was due to having nine and a half months of compensation and benefits costs associated with the pavilion acquisition in the balance of the increase in compensation and benefits resulted from year over year merit increases and an increase in staff to support the operations of the company 
occupancy costs for increased to million from million in  with over half of that increase associated 
table of contents with the pavilion acquisition 
data processing costs increased  in from directly related to the pavilion acquisition 
first defiance s other noninterest expense category also increased to million in from million in the most significant reason for the increase in that category was an  increase in amortization expense of intangibles relating to the core deposit and customer relationship intangible in conjunction with the pavilion acquisition and a  expense associated with losses related to a former investment advisor which was recorded after the denial of coverage under the company s fidelity bond 
other items which caused the increase in this expense category include higher levels of advertising up  credit and collection expenses up  and state franchise tax up 
income taxes income taxes amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the effective tax rates for those years were   and  respectively 
the tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate for the company mainly because of investments in tax exempt securities

concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio  northeast indiana and southeast michigan market areas 
management has also identified lending for income generating rental properties as an industry concentration 
total loans for income generating property totaled million at december   which represents of the company s loan portfolio 
management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated with this type of lending 
loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency 
the delinquency rate in this category  which is any loan days or more past due  was at december  there are no other industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments

table of contents critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio  northeast indiana and southeast michigan regions in which the company does business 
factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers  and other matters that may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the company s market area  and other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified 
while management believes its allowance for loan losses is conservatively determined based on the above factors  it does not believe the allowances to be excessive or unnecessary 
refer to the section titled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a further description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
in assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio  management utilizes a third party that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios 
that third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation 
prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for and year mortgage backed securities 
those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on 
table of contents the size of the loan 
the discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note statement of accounting policies  and note mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s valuation process  methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses 
valuation of securities first defiance believes the valuation of certain securities is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this is pertaining to the company s investment in certain trust preferred debt obligations securities cdos 
as required by fasb asc topic  declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  are reflected in earnings as realized losses to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses 
the amount of other than temporary impairment that does not relate to the credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the fair value of these cdos  which are backed by trust preferred securities issued by banks  thrifts and insurance companies  have a fair value of million 
the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which cdos trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive as no new cdos have been issued since there are currently very few market participants who are willing and or able to transact for these securities 
the market values for these securities and any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the us treasury are very depressed relative to historical levels 
thus in today s market  a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general versus being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue 
given the conditions in the debt markets today and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets  management has determined the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of determining fair value at december   an income valuation approach technique present value technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than the market approach valuation used at the prior measurement dates and the company s cdos will be classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date 
the company s cdo valuations were prepared by an independent third party 
their approach to determining fair value involved several steps detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in the cdo  collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in the cdo default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities and discounted cash flow modeling 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 

table of contents first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by just over the base case scenario 
it should be noted that other areas of first defiance s income statement  such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income 
the majority of first defiance s lending activities are in non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio was million  which was split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of home equity and improvement loans million at december  of which million fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
approximately million of home equity and improvement loans have fixed rates but the maturities on those loans range from three to five years 
first defiance also has consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  as well as to provide liquidity  first federal sells a majority of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates as of december  was considered to be remote given the current interest rate levels and therefore was not included in this analysis 
the results of this analysis is reflected in the following table 
table economic value of equity analysis december  economic value of equity economic value of equity as of present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a decrease in its economic value of equity 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is relatively low because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations and the durations are fairly closely matched 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 

table of contents in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
