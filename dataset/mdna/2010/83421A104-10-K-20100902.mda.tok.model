overview of the business we are the leading global provider of software and services to the automobile insurance claims processing industry 
we also provide products and services that complement our insurance claims processing software and services  including used vehicle validation and fraud detection software and services 
our automobile insurance claims processing customers include insurance companies  collision repair facilities  independent assessors and automotive recyclers 
we help our customers estimate the costs to repair damaged vehicles and determine pre collision fair market values for damaged vehicles for which the repair costs exceed the vehicles value  automate and outsource steps of the claims process that insurance companies have historically performed internally  and improve their ability to monitor and manage their businesses through data reporting and analysis 
as of june   we served over  customers and were active in more than countries with approximately  employees 
our customers include more than  automobile insurance companies   collision repair facilities   independent assessors and  automotive recyclers and auto dealers 
we derive revenues from many of the world s largest automobile insurance companies  including eight of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in europe and nine of the ten largest automobile insurance companies in north america 
segments we operate our business using two reportable segments emea and americas 
our emea segment consists of our operations in europe  the middle east  africa  asia and australia 
our americas segment consists of our operations in north  central and south america 
we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments based on revenues and adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure that represents gaap net income excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  restructuring charges  asset impairments and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities  other income expense  and acquisition related costs 
we do not allocate certain costs  including costs related to our financing activities  business development and oversight  and tax  audit and other professional fees  to our reportable segments 
instead  we manage these costs at the corporate level 
the accounting policies for each of our segments are the same 
the table below sets forth our revenues by reportable segment and as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated dollars in millions fiscal years ended june  emea americas total 
table of contents set forth below is our revenues from each of our principal customer categories and as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated dollars in millions fiscal years ended june  insurance companies collision repair facilities independent assessors automotive recyclers and others total for fiscal year  the united states  the united kingdom and germany were the only countries that individually represented more than of total revenues 
components of revenues and expenses revenues we generate revenues from the sale of software and services to our customers pursuant to negotiated contracts or pricing agreements 
pricing for our software and services is set forth in these agreements and negotiated with each customer 
we generally bill our customers monthly under one or more of the following bases price per transaction fixed monthly amount for a prescribed number of transactions fixed monthly subscription rate price per set of services rendered price per system delivered our software and services are often sold as packages  without individual pricing for each component 
our revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which we estimate based on both our examination of a subset of customer accounts and historical experience 
our core offering is our estimating and workflow software  which is used by our insurance company  collision repair facility and independent assessor customers and which represents the majority of our revenues 
our salvage and recycling software  business intelligence and consulting services  vehicle data validation  salvage disposition and other offerings represent in the aggregate a smaller portion of our revenues 
we believe that our estimating and workflow software will continue to represent a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future

restructuring charges  asset impairments and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities restructuring charges  asset impairments and other costs associated with exit or disposal activities primarily represent costs incurred in relation to our restructuring initiatives 
restructuring charges primarily include employee termination benefits charges and charges related to the lease and vendor contract liabilities that we do not expect to provide future economic benefits due to the implementation of our restructuring initiatives 
acquisition related costs acquisition related costs include legal and other professional fees and other transaction costs associated with completed and contemplated business combinations and asset acquisitions  costs associated with integrating acquired businesses  including costs incurred to eliminate workforce redundancies and for product rebranding  and other charges incurred as a direct result of our acquisition efforts 
these other charges include changes to the fair value of contingent purchase consideration  acquired assets and assumed liabilities subsequent to the completion of the purchase price allocation  purchase consideration that is deemed to be compensatory in nature and gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a pre existing contractual relationship with an acquiree as a result of the acquisition

table of contents income tax provision income taxes have been provided for all items included in the statements of operations included herein  regardless of when such items were reported for tax purposes or when the taxes were actually paid or refunded 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests several of our customers and other entities own noncontrolling interests in six of our operating subsidiaries 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflect such owners proportionate interest in the earnings of such operating subsidiaries 
factors affecting our operating results below is a summary description of several external factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results 
foreign currency 
during fiscal years  and  we generated approximately  and of our revenues  respectively  and incurred a majority of our costs  in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
in our historical financial statements  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period for our statement of operations and certain components of stockholders equity and the exchange rate at the end of that period for the balance sheet 
these translations resulted in a net foreign currency translation adjustment of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
these amounts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in euros  pound sterling  swiss francs  canadian dollars and other international currencies 
the following table provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the euro and pound sterling since the beginning of fiscal year period average euro to us dollar exchange rate average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  the us dollar weakened against many of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business 
relative to the euro  the average us dollar weakened by  which increased our expenses and increased our revenues for the fiscal year relating to the euro markets in which we transact business 
in contrast  the average us dollar strengthened against the pound sterling by  which decreased our expenses and decreased our revenues for fiscal year relating to the united kingdom 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the us dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in a million decrease or increase  as the case may be  to our revenues during fiscal year we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risks 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  we recognized net foreign currency transaction gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations of million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents factors that affect business volume 
the following external factors have or may have an effect on the number of claims that are submitted and or our volume of transactions  any of which can affect our revenues automobile usage number of miles driven 
in fiscal year  the number of miles driven in the united states and several of our large western european markets declined due to higher gasoline prices and difficult economic conditions 
in fiscal year  the number of miles driven in the united states increased slightly versus fiscal year fewer miles driven can result in fewer automobile accidents  which can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
number of insurance claims made 
in fiscal year  the number of insurance claims for vehicle damage submitted by owners to their insurance carriers has declined slightly in several of our markets  including some of our large western european markets 
we do not know whether the decline in the number of claims made is a result of fewer accidents  other factors  such as vehicle owners reluctance to pay the insurance policy deductible for vehicle repair  or a combination of factors 
the number of insurance claims made in fiscal year increased slightly versus fiscal year fewer claims made can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
sales of new and used vehicles 
according to industry sources global vehicle sales declined by approximately in calendar year to million units  and global vehicle sales are expected to increase in calendar year by approximately to million units 
fewer new light vehicle sales can result in fewer insured vehicles on the road and fewer automobile accidents  which can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate 
used vehicle retail and wholesale values 
declines in retail and wholesale used vehicle values can impact vehicle owner and insurance carrier decisions about which damaged vehicles should be repaired and which should be declared a total loss 
the lower the retail and wholesale used vehicle values  the more likely it is that a greater percentage of automobiles are declared a total loss versus a partial loss 
the fewer number of vehicles that owners and insurance carriers decide to repair can reduce the transaction based fees that we generate for partial loss estimates  but may have a beneficial impact on the transaction based fees that we generate for total loss estimates 
damaged vehicle repair costs 
the cost to repair damaged vehicles  also known as severity  includes labor  parts and other related costs 
severity has steadily risen for a number of years 
according to the insurance resource council  the average severity per damaged vehicle in the united states rose by from to more recently  the us bureau of labor statistics reported that the cost of motor vehicle body work for the twelve months ended april rose by compared to the same prior year period 
insurance companies purchase our products and services to help standardize the cost of repair 
should the cost of labor  parts and other related items continue to increase over time  insurance companies may seek to purchase and utilize an increasing number of our products and services to help improve the standardization of the cost of repair 
penetration rate of vehicle insurance 
an increasing rate of procuring vehicle insurance will result in an increase in the number of insurance claims made for damaged vehicles 
an increasing number of insurance claims submitted can increase the transaction based fees that we generate for partial loss and total loss estimates 
the rate of vehicle insurance is increasing in many of our less mature international markets 
this is due in part to both increased regulation and increased use of financing in the purchase of new and used vehicles 
we expect that the rate of vehicle insurance in our less mature international markets will continue to increase during the next eighteen months 
seasonality 
our business is subject to seasonal and other fluctuations 
in particular  we have historically experienced higher revenues during the second quarter and third quarter versus the first quarter and fourth quarter during each fiscal year 
this seasonality is caused primarily by more days of inclement weather during the second quarter and third quarter in most of our markets  which contributes to a greater number of vehicle accidents and damage during these periods 
in addition  our business is subject to fluctuations caused by other factors  including the occurrence of extraordinary weather events and the timing of certain public holidays 
for example  the easter holiday occurs during 
table of contents the third quarter in certain fiscal years and occurs during the fourth quarter in other fiscal years  resulting in a change in the number of business days during the quarter in which the holiday occurs 
non cash charges 
we incurred pre tax  non cash share based compensation charges of million  million and million  respectively  during fiscal years  and we expect to recognize additional pre tax  non cash share based compensation charges related to share based awards outstanding at june  aggregating approximately million ratably over the remaining weighted average vesting period of years 
restructuring charges 
we have incurred restructuring charges in each period presented and also expect to incur additional restructuring charges  primarily relating to severance costs  over the next several quarters as we work to improve efficiencies in our business 
these charges  consisting primarily of termination benefits  will reduce our cash balances 
we do not expect reduced revenues or an increase in other expenses as a result of continued implementation of our restructuring initiatives 
other factors 
other factors that have or may have an effect on our operating results include gain and loss of customers  pricing pressures  acquisitions  joint ventures or similar transactions  expenses to develop new software or services  expenses and restrictions related to indebtedness 
we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in recent years

interest expense fiscal year vs 
fiscal year and fiscal year vs 
fiscal year during fiscal year  interest expense decreased million due primarily to declines in the variable interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness and declines in the notional amounts of our interest rate swaps 
during fiscal year  interest expense decreased million as compared to fiscal year due to lower borrowings under our credit facilities resulting primarily from principal repayments in fiscal year notwithstanding the impact of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  we expect that our annual interest expense will continue to decrease as we repay outstanding indebtedness and as the notional amounts of our interest rate swaps continue to decline  assuming no additional borrowings  including borrowings to finance any future acquisitions 
other income expense  net fiscal year vs

fiscal year and fiscal year vs 
fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
during fiscal year  we recorded an income tax provision of million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year was primarily attributable to a shift in the jurisdictional mix of taxable income 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year was attributable to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets in fiscal year which caused an increase in our fiscal year income tax provision 
the effective tax rate is reduced by the benefit attributable to foreign income taxed at lower rates and tax credits generated during the year 
factors that impact our income tax provision include  but are not limited to  the mix of jurisdictional earnings  establishment of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions  and varying jurisdictional income tax rates 
changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
there have been several international provisions recently enacted which could impact our effective tax rate and we are in the process of evaluating this impact 
in addition  there are several proposals to extend legislation that has recently expired and whether or not these provisions are extended could have a significant impact on our tax rate 
we evaluate the positive and negative evidence in connection with its assessment for a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets during each reporting period 
as of june  the key objective negative evidence  which is generally difficult to overcome  includes a cumulative us pre tax book loss over the past three years 
based on preliminary income projections for next year  we contemplate the likelihood that the cumulative three year position may shift into an income position as soon as during the third or fourth quarter of fiscal year when and if this occurs  it will be positive objective evidence for purposes of determining when 
table of contents and to what extent the us valuation allowance will be released 
other factors will still need to be considered during this evaluation process however a cumulative pre tax book income position will be significant positive evidence 
we will continue to evaluate this area each reporting period 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have included cash generated from operations  proceeds from our may initial public offering and our november secondary public stock offering  and borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have included business combinations  debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
we expect that these will remain our principal uses of cash in the future 
in may  we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility  which provides us with the following borrowing commitments a million revolving credit facility  a million us term loan and a million european term loan 
as of june   we had million and million million in outstanding loans under the us term loan and european term loan  respectively  with interest rates of and  respectively 
no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at june  in order to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our term loans  in june  we entered into three us dollar based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  million million as of june  per the planned reduction in the notional amount over the life of the swap contract  and million  each with maturities on june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
we also entered into three euro based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million million as of june  per the planned reduction in the notional amount over the life of the swap contract  million million as of june  per the planned reduction in the notional amount over the life of the swap contract  and million  each with maturities as late as june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
the amended and restated senior secured credit facility contains a leverage ratio  which is applicable only if specified minimum borrowings are outstanding during a quarter 
in addition  the amended and restated senior secured credit facility contains covenants restricting us from undertaking specified corporate actions  including asset dispositions  acquisitions  payment of dividends and other specified payments  changes of control  incurrence of indebtedness  creation of liens  making loans and investments and transactions with affiliates 
pursuant to agreements entered into prior to the csg acquisition  the noncontrolling stockholders of certain of our majority owned subsidiaries have the right to require us to redeem their shares at the then fair market value 
for financial statement reporting purposes  the estimated fair market value of these redeemable noncontrolling interests was million at june  we do not have any indication that the exercise of these redemption rights is probable within the next twelve months 
further  we do not believe the occurrence of conditions precedent to the exercise of certain of these redemption rights is probable within the next twelve months 
if the stockholders exercised their redemption rights  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund such redemptions but such redemptions may require a waiver under our senior secured credit facility 
obtaining such a waiver would be subject to conditions prevalent in the capital markets at that time  and could involve changes to the terms of our senior secured credit facility  including changes that could result in our incurring additional interest expense 
if we were not able to obtain such a waiver  we could be in breach of our senior secured credit facility or in breach of our agreements with the noncontrolling stockholders 
the remaining ownership interest in autoonline held by the sellers is subject to a put call option that may be exercised by any party beginning in fiscal year  or earlier under certain circumstances 
the redemption value of the option is equal to ten times autoonline s consolidated earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization the autoonline ebitda for the fiscal year ended prior to the exercise date  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
as of june  and  we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million  respectively 

table of contents we believe that our existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our amended and restated senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we regularly review acquisition and other strategic opportunities  which may require additional debt or equity financing 
we currently do not have any material pending agreements with respect to any acquisition or strategic opportunity 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders may result 
additional debt financing may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any equity or debt financing may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
during each quarter of fiscal year  we paid a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record 
the aggregate dividend payments were approximately million 
on july   we announced that our board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock and per outstanding restricted stock unit payable on september  to stockholders and restricted stock unit holders of record at the close of business on september  any determination to pay dividends in future periods will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
the following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented amount changed from fiscal years ended june  to to in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in net income of million and increases in the non cash adjustments  such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  deferred income taxes  and the change in fair value of financial instruments  to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities  and by the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities 
the million decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year was principally attributable to the proceeds from the maturities of short term investments 
financing activities 
the million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to the million in cash proceeds raised during fiscal year from a secondary public offering of our common stock and cash dividends paid on common shares and participating securities as well as to noncontrolling interests 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our cash contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations contingent purchase consideration purchase obligations lease obligations total 
table of contents represents principal and interest payments for our senior secured credit facilities and the note payable issued in connection with our acquisition of hpi  as well as payments on our interest rate swaps 
for purposes of the table above  we calculated the interest payments on our senior secured credit facilities and interest rate swaps assuming that the interest rate in effect on the senior secured credit facilities at june  would remain fixed through maturity 
represents the accrued contingent purchase consideration as of june  contingent future cash payments related to acquisitions completed in fiscal year are accrued at fair value as of the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value at each reporting date 
contingent future cash payments related to acquisitions completed prior to fiscal year are accrued once the contingency is resolved and the amounts are due and payable 
lease obligations include operating and capital leases and are net of sublease income 
we determined the fair value of future contingent purchase consideration related to acquisitions completed in fiscal year based on the weighted probabilities of potential future payments 
the amount and timing of future payments are based on the achievement of specific targets 
the fair values were determined by assessing the probability of each potential outcome using information available through june   including recent financial performance and changes in the market 
accrued contingent purchase consideration as of june  has remained unchanged since the date of acquisition 
in addition to the contractual obligations identified in the preceding table  the noncontrolling owners of certain of our subsidiaries have the right to put their shares to us at a purchase price equal to the then fair value of the shares 
as of june   we estimate that the aggregate fair value of these redeemable noncontrolling interests was approximately million 
in addition  the ownership interest of autoonline not owned by us is subject to a put call option whereby the redemption value of the option is equal to ten times the autoonline ebitda for the fiscal year ended prior to the exercise date  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
except under certain circumstances  the put call option cannot be exercised until the ebitda for fiscal year is determined 
the redemption of these noncontrolling interests by these noncontrolling owners is not within our control and the timing is uncertain 
we also have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of june  the timing of the future cash flows related to this liability cannot be practically determined 
off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of june   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
certain noncontrolling stockholders of our international subsidiaries are also commercial purchasers and users of our software and services 
revenue transactions with all of the individual noncontrolling stockholders in the aggregate were less than of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  and aggregate accounts receivable from the noncontrolling stockholders represent less than of consolidated accounts receivable at june  and critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form 
table of contents the basis for our judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies  many of which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions  are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment indicators arise when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable  such as a significant downturn in industry or economic trends with a direct impact on the business  an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of for less than the carrying value  loss of key personnel  or a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group 
we test goodwill for impairment annually at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the potential impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units through an income approach  utilizing a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach  which considers comparable companies and transactions 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
under the market approach  fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit 
the multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions  discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size  diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions 
in our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year  we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned exceeded their respective carrying values by between and and  accordingly  we did not identify any goodwill impairment 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets at the unit of accounting level by making a determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that are not subject to amortization on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  that asset is tested for impairment 
after recognition of the impairment  if any  the asset is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
we primarily determine fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets under an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model 
in our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment assessment for 
table of contents fiscal year  we concluded that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying value and  accordingly  we did not identify any impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other factors that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
we consider a long lived asset to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
if we deem an asset to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized only after services are provided  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and when collectability is probable 
our multiple element arrangements primarily include a combination of software licenses  hosted database and other services  installation and set up services  hardware  maintenance services and transaction based deliverables 
we generate a significant majority of our revenue from subscription based contracts where a monthly fee is charged  transaction based contracts where a fee per transaction is charged and subscription based contracts with additional transaction based fees where a monthly fee and a fee per transaction are charged 
subscription based and transaction based contracts generally include the delivery of software  access to software through a hosted service hosted database  upfront fees for the implementation and set up activities necessary for the client to use access the software implementation services and maintenance 
under a subscription arrangement  delivery of software  we consider access to the hosted database and maintenance to be a single element or a combined unit of accounting and recognize related revenues at the end of each month upon the completion of the monthly service 
a transaction based fee represents a payment for the right to use the software  access to the hosted database and maintenance 
we consider the fee to be fixed and determinable only at the time actual usage occurs  and  accordingly  we recognize revenue at the time of actual usage 
the revenue recognition for implementation services is described below 
implementation services and setup activities are necessary for the client to receive services software 
we defer up front fees billed during the setup implementation phase and recognize such revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
recognition of this deferred revenue will commence upon the start of the monthly service 
we capitalize setup costs that are direct and incremental to the contract are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
in a limited number of our revenue arrangements  we also provide generic computer equipment as part of the sales arrangement 
the computer equipment in this arrangement is considered a non software deliverable as our software is not essential to the functionality of the generic computer equipment 
we account for the sale of generic equipment as a direct finance lease 
the related revenue is recognized over the term of the contract using the effective interest rate method 
we allocate revenue to the elements of these arrangements on a relative fair value basis using our best estimate of the fair value of the elements 
revenue from leased computer equipment represents approximately of our consolidated revenue 
revenues are reflected net of customer sales allowances  which are based on both specific identification of certain accounts and a predetermined percentage of revenue based on historical experience 
stock based compensation 
we expense share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted common shares subject to repurchase and restricted stock units 
we 
table of contents estimate the value of stock options as of the date the award was granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock units equals the intrinsic value on the date the award was granted 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine the expected volatility based on a combination of implied market volatilities  historical volatility of our stock price and other factors 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us constant rate treasury securities in effect at the time of the grant with remaining terms equivalent to the respective expected terms of the share based award 
expected dividend yield 
our assumption of the dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts and may be subject to substantial change in the future 
expected award life 
because we have a limited history of stock option exercises  we determine the expected award life using the simplified method  which defines the life as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period 
in addition to the variables above  we are also required to estimate at the grant date the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on industry and employee turnover data as well as historical pre vesting forfeitures occurring over the previous year 
we recognize additional share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated and a recovery of previously recognized share based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than estimated 
income taxes 
income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future enactments of changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax liabilities are more likely than not to be assessed 
if we ultimately determine that the obligation is unwarranted  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
this may occur for a variety of reasons  such as the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a particular tax return or the signing of a final settlement agreement with the respective tax authority 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing for tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences  or reversing book tax differences  resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable and to the extent we believe that realizability does not meet the more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include a tax expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations unless a current year valuation allowance is allocated to an item of equity 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowances  which could impact our results of operations in the quarter in which such determination is made 

table of contents we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence as of june   it was concluded that it was not more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily in the us  would be realized within their respective carryforward periods and  accordingly  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million as of june  derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions occur and affect earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in results of operations 
our derivative financial instruments at june  consisted entirely of interest rate swaps 
these interest rate swaps were designated and documented at their inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges is recognized in interest expense 
we estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps using industry standard valuation techniques to extrapolate future reset rates from period end yield curves and standard valuation models based on the black scholes option valuation model 
market based observable inputs including spot and forward rates  volatilities and interest rate curves at observable intervals are used as inputs to the models 
redeemable noncontrolling interests 
certain of the ownership interests in our consolidated subsidiaries held by noncontrolling owners are considered redeemable outside of our control 
accordingly  we have presented these redeemable noncontrolling interests as a mezzanine item in our consolidated balance sheet 
if redeemable at fair value  the redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported at their fair value with any adjustment of the carrying value to fair value recorded to common shares in stockholders equity 
we estimate the fair value of our noncontrolling interests through an income approach  utilizing a discounted cash flow model  and a market approach  which considers comparable companies and transactions 
under the income approach  the discounted cash flow model determines fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows over a specific projection period and a residual value related to future cash flows beyond the projection period 
both values are discounted to reflect the degree of risk inherent in an investment in the reporting unit and achieving the projected cash flows 
a weighted average cost of capital of a market participant is used as the discount rate 
the residual value is generally determined by applying a constant terminal growth rate to the estimated net cash flows at the end of the projection period 
alternatively  the present value of the residual value may be determined by applying a market multiple at the end of the projection period 
under the market approach  fair value is determined based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for each reporting unit 
the multiples were determined based on a selection of comparable companies and acquisition transactions  discounted for each reporting unit to reflect the relative size  diversification and risk of the reporting unit in comparison to the indexed companies and transactions 

table of contents the noncontrolling ownership interest in autoonline is redeemable at ten times the autoonline ebitda for the fiscal year ended prior to redemption  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
except under certain circumstances  the put call option cannot be exercised until the ebitda for fiscal year is determined 
because the autoonline noncontrolling interest is not currently redeemable  we are accreting the carrying value to the redemption value at each reporting period through the earliest redemption date 
accordingly  the carrying value of the autoonline noncontrolling interest represents the initial carrying amount  adjusted to reflect the noncontrolling interests share of net income and dividends paid  plus periodic accretion 
additionally  if the fair value of the autoonline noncontrolling interest were to exceed the redemption value  the excess would be treated as an adjustment to the numerator in our calculation of net income per common share attributable to solera holdings  inc which would result in a decrease in our net income per share 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb reached a consensus on two new pronouncements accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu no 
eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or ii third party evidence tpe of stand alone selling price before an entity can recognize the portion of the consideration that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu no 
modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new pronouncements are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these pronouncements will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct operations in many countries around the world 
our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we incur currency transaction risk when we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant domestic currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents exchange rates between most of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in euros  pound sterling  swiss francs  canadian dollars and other international currencies 
the following table provides the average quarterly exchange rates for the euro and pound sterling since the beginning of fiscal year period average euro to us dollar exchange rate average pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  the us dollar weakened against many of the major foreign currencies we use to transact our business 
relative to the euro  the average us dollar weakened by  which increased our expenses and increased our revenues for the fiscal year relating to the euro markets in which we transact business 
in contrast  the average us dollar strengthened against the pound sterling by  which decreased our expenses and decreased our revenues for fiscal year relating to the united kingdom 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the us dollar versus other currencies in which we transact our business would have resulted in a million decrease or increase  as the case may be  to our revenues during fiscal year we currently do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risks 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  we recognized net foreign currency transaction gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations of million  million  and million  respectively 
in february  we entered into a foreign exchange option that gave us the right to call million in us dollars at a strike price of per us dollar at any time up to february  we paid approximately million for this option 
in november  we sold the foreign exchange option for million 
historically  other than the foreign currency option described above  we have not undertaken hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and financial condition  however  we may decide to do so in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through variable interest rate borrowings under our term loans 
our weighted average borrowings outstanding under our term loans during fiscal year were million 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our term loans  in june  we entered into three us dollar based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  million million as of june  per the planned reduction in the notional amount over the life of the swap contract  and million  each with maturities on june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
we also entered into three euro based interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million million as of june  per the planned reduction in the notional amount over the life of the swap contract  million million as of june  per the planned reduction in the notional amount over the life of the swap contract  and million  each with maturities as late as june   which require us to pay fixed rates of   and  respectively 
these interest rate swaps are 
table of contents designated and documented at their inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these cash flow hedges is recognized in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the estimated fair values of the us dollar based swaps were liabilities of million and million at june  and  respectively  which were included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated fair values of the euro based swaps were liabilities of million million and million million at june  and  respectively  which were included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the change in the fair value of the swaps  net of tax  reflects the effective portion of loss on these hedges and is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
after giving effect to the interest rate swaps  the weighted average interest rate on our term loans during fiscal year was 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an approximately million change to our interest expense for fiscal year
