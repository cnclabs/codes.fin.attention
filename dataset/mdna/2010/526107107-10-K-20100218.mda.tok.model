item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in four reportable business segments of the hvacr industry 
our reportable segments include residential heating cooling  commercial heating cooling  service experts and refrigeration 
for more detailed information regarding our reportable segments  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our products and services are sold through a combination of distributors  independent and company owned dealer service centers  other installing contractors  wholesalers  manufacturers representatives  original equipment manufacturers and to national accounts 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
warmer than normal summer temperatures generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winter temperatures have the same effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress hvacr sales and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence 
the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in our service experts segment  the principal components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
in recent years  increased prices for these commodities and related components have challenged us and the hvacr industry in general 
we seek to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices through a combination of price increases for our products and services  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we also seek to mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts 
a substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business  with the balance comprised of new construction business 
with the current downturn in residential and commercial new 
table of contents construction activity and current overall economic conditions  we have seen a decline in the demand for the products and services we sell into these markets 
impact of current economic environment on our business during  we continued to face challenging market conditions as the global economic downturn continued to impact consumer and business confidence 
for the year  revenues declined across all of our business units 
however  the rate of decline in our residential heating cooling business slowed during the latter part of and that business showed year over year growth in the fourth quarter 
for the year  the rate of decline increased in our commercial heating cooling and refrigeration businesses 
however  the rate of decline in these business units slowed in the fourth quarter 
we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to win new business  capture opportunities in the replacement market  and lower our cost structure for the current market conditions 
we are continuing to adjust to lower demand levels in our end markets with accelerated efforts to increase our operational efficiency and reduce costs while we maintain focus on providing our customers a high level of value and service 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
in addition to the savings related to restructuring activities  we believe that we will realize additional savings from lower commodity prices on certain metals and from our global sourcing initiatives 
we are also executing on additional operating efficiency and cost reduction initiatives that are designed to substantially reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses through salaried headcount reduction and other measures 
our salaried headcount was down for we believe that when market conditions recover  we will be well positioned to drive increased earnings leverage 
key financial statistics net sales for were  million and were adversely impacted on a year over year basis primarily by lower volumes across all segments as a result of the difficult economic environment 
operational income for was million as compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  operational income decreased to in from in the decline in operational income was primarily due to lower sales partially offset by lower material costs and savings from cost reductions and productivity initiatives 
net income for was million as compared to in basic earnings per share from continuing operations were in as compared to in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were per share in  down from per share in cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million in cash provided by operating activities was higher primarily due to improved working capital management and the return of collateral posted related to commodity hedges 
these increases were partially offset by lower net income and repayments related to our asset securitization program 
in  we returned to shareholders million through cash dividends

for the year  we saw rates of decline increase across all segments 
however  our end markets showed improvement late in the year and particularly in the fourth quarter  with our residential hvac end markets showing growth in the fourth quarter 
the commercial hvac and refrigeration markets were still down from a year ago  but the rate of decline continued to slow in the fourth quarter 
the declines in unit volumes were partially offset by pricing gains of approximately and positive sales mix of almost 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted revenues by

other covenants contained in the domestic revolving credit facility restrict  among other things  mergers  asset dispositions  guarantees  debt  liens  acquisitions  investments  affiliate transactions and our ability to make restricted payments 
the financial covenants require us to maintain defined levels of consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio and a cash flow defined as ebitda minus capital expenditures to net interest expense ratio 
the required ratios under our domestic revolving credit facility as of december  are detailed below consolidated indebtedness to adjusted ebitda ratio no greater than cash flow to net interest expense ratio no less than our domestic revolving credit facility contains customary events of default 
these events of default include nonpayment of principal or interest  breach of covenants or other restrictions or requirements  default on any other indebtedness or receivables securitizations cross default  and bankruptcy 
a cross default could occur if we fail to pay any principal or interest when due on any other indebtedness or receivables securitization of at least million  or we are in default on any other indebtedness or receivables securitization in an aggregate principal amount of at least million  which would give the holders the right to declare such indebtedness due and payable prior to its stated maturity 
if a cross default was to occur  it could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise occur from a default of a single debt instrument or lease commitment 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to terminate our right to borrow under our domestic revolving credit facility and accelerate amounts due under our domestic revolving credit facility except for a bankruptcy event of default  in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate 
the domestic promissory notes contain similar financial covenant restrictions as our domestic revolving credit facility described above 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements 
our domestic revolving credit facility and promissory notes are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries 
we have additional borrowing capacity through several foreign facilities governed by agreements between us and various banks 
these borrowings are used primarily to finance seasonal borrowing needs of our foreign subsidiaries 
we had million and million of obligations outstanding through our foreign subsidiaries as of december  and  respectively 
available borrowing capacity at december  and  on foreign facilities was million and million  respectively 
under a revolving period asset securitization arrangement asa  we are eligible to transfer beneficial interests in a portion of our trade accounts receivable to third parties in exchange for cash 
our continued involvement in the transferred assets includes servicing  collection and administration of the transferred beneficial 
table of contents interests 
the sale of the beneficial interests in our trade accounts receivable are reflected as secured borrowings 
the fair values assigned to the retained and transferred interests are based primarily on the receivables carrying value given the short term to maturity and low credit risk 
the asa provides for a maximum securitization amount of million or of the net pool balance as defined by the asa 
however  eligibility for securitization is limited based on the amount and quality of the qualifying accounts receivable and is calculated monthly 
the beneficial interest sold cannot exceed the maximum amount even if our qualifying accounts receivable is greater than the maximum amount at any point in time 
the eligible amounts available were as follows in millions for the years ended december  eligible amount available under the asa on qualified accounts receivable beneficial interest sold remaining amount available as of december  and  million of cash and cash equivalents were restricted primarily due to routine lockbox collections and letters of credit issued with respect to the operations of our captive insurance subsidiary  which expire on december   and will be renewed upon expiration 
these letters of credit restrictions can be transferred to our revolving lines of credit as needed 
in june our board of directors approved a new share repurchase plan  pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to million of shares of our common stock through open market purchases the share repurchase plan 
we periodically review our capital structure  including our primary bank facility  to ensure that it has adequate liquidity 
we believe that cash flows from operations  as well as available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other existing sources of funding  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and the share repurchases under the share repurchase plan 
during the third quarter of  we amended the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters 
while the same party continues to be the lessor under the lease  the amendment  among other things  replaced the debt participant and moderately increased the rent payments 
the amendment also provides for financial covenants consistent with our domestic revolving credit agreement and we are in compliance with these financial covenants 
the lease will continue to be accounted for as an operating lease 
during  we expanded our tifton  georgia manufacturing facility using the proceeds from industrial development bonds idbs 
we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of the property and the issuer of the idbs  and through our lease payments fund the interest payments to investors in the idbs 
we also guaranteed the repayment of the idbs and entered into letters of credit totaling million to fund a potential repurchase of the idbs in the event that investors exercised their right to tender the idbs to the trustee 
as of december  and  we recorded both a long term asset and a corresponding long term obligation of and million  respectively  related to these transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the credit facilities and promissory notes described above  we also lease real estate and machinery and equipment pursuant to operating leases that are not capitalized on the balance sheet  including high turnover equipment such as autos and service vehicles and short lived equipment such as personal computers 
these leases generated rent expense of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of payments associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
purchase obligations consist of aluminum commitments

fair value measurements fair value hierarchy the three level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements are defined as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at the measurement date and for the anticipated term of the instrument 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value techniques general our valuation techniques are applied to all of the assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
where available  the fair values are based upon quoted prices in active markets 
however  if quoted prices are not available  then the fair values are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or independently sourced market parameters  such as credit default swap spreads  yield curves  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  interest rates and benchmark securities 
for assets and liabilities with a lack of observable market activity  if any  the fair values are based upon discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating assumptions that  in our judgment  reflect the assumptions a marketplace participant would use 
to ensure that financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  valuation adjustments may be required to reflect either party s creditworthiness and ability to pay 
where appropriate  these amounts were incorporated into our valuations as of december  and  the measurement dates 

table of contents derivatives derivatives are primarily valued using estimated future cash flows that are based directly on observed prices from exchange traded derivatives and  therefore  have been classified as level we also take into account the counterparty s creditworthiness  or our own creditworthiness  as appropriate 
an adjustment has been recorded in order to reflect the risk of credit default  but these adjustments have been insignificant to the overall value of the derivatives 
short term investments during the third quarter of  we liquidated all of the short term investments reported on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  the majority of our short term investments were managed by professional investment advisors 
the net asset values were furnished in statements received from the investment advisor and reflect valuations based upon the respective pricing policies utilized by the investment advisor 
we assessed the classification of the inputs used to value these investments as level through examination of pricing policies and significant inputs and through discussions with investment managers 
the fair values of our short term investments were based on several observable inputs including  but not limited to  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads and benchmark securities 
these investments consisted of us government and government agency securities  corporate bonds  asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and various securitized debt instruments 
the majority of these investments were of high quality  with having aaa ratings 
the application of our valuation techniques resulted in no net changes to the valuations for these securities as of december  pension plan assets the majority of our commingled pool collective trust  mutual funds and balanced pension trusts are managed by professional investment advisors 
the net asset values nav per share are furnished in monthly and or quarterly statements received from the investment advisors and reflect valuations based upon their pricing policies 
we have assessed the classification of the inputs used to value these investments at level for mutual funds and level for commingled pool collective trusts and balance pension trusts through examination of their pricing policies and the related controls and procedures 
the fair values we report are based on the pool or trust s nav per share 
the nav s per share are calculated periodically daily or no less than one time per month as the aggregate value of each pool or trust s underlying assets divided by the number of units owned 
market risk commodity price risk we enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices expected to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content 
these contracts are for quantities equal to or less than quantities expected to be consumed in future production 
fluctuations in metal commodity prices impact the value of the derivative instruments that we hold 
when metal commodity prices rise  the fair value of our futures contracts increases and conversely  when commodity prices fall  the fair value of our futures contracts decreases 
during  metal commodity prices decreased considerably in a short time period  which resulted in significant derivative loss positions 
as a result of these loss positions  we were required to post collateral of million as of december  during  metal commodity prices remained relatively stable and as a result  our commodity contracts that were in loss positions at december  have expired and we were no longer required to post collateral as of december  the collateral posted was treated as a prepaid expense and recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we also recorded derivative losses  net of tax  of million in aocl as of december  during  our commodity contracts that were in loss positions at december  have expired and we recorded derivative gains  net of tax  of million in aocl as of december  we believe that this decline in metal prices was an extraordinary event because of its size and its occurrence over a relatively short timeframe

in order to partially mitigate interest rate risk  we use a hedging strategy to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the interest payments for the first million of the total variable rate debt outstanding under the domestic revolving credit facility that is solely due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
this strategy allows us to fix a portion of our interest payments while also taking advantage of historically low interest rates 
on june   we entered into a million pay fixed  receive variable interest rate swap with a large financial institution at a fixed interest rate of 
the variable portion of the interest rate swap is tied to month libor the benchmark interest rate 
the interest rates under both the interest rate swap and the underlying debt are reset  the swap is settled with the counterparty  and interest is paid  on a monthly basis 
the interest rate swap expires october  we account for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how such policies can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
we consider our most critical accounting policies to be goodwill and other intangible assets  product warranties  pension and postretirement benefits  self insurance expense  derivative accounting  and income taxes
