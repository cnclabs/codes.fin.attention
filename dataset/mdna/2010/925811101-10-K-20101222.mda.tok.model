the company evaluates the recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount 
the company s ability to recover the reported amounts of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which net temporary tax differences become deductible 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses
