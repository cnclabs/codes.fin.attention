we continue to expand our global presence and service offerings to increase revenue  improve operational efficiencies and drive brand loyalty for our clients 
as of december   we had over  employees worldwide 
we are subject to quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and earnings  based on the timing of new and expiring client programs and seasonality in certain client programs 
from time to time clients seek to shift their crm programs to lower cost providers  which may interrupt or decrease our results of operations as we seek to shift personnel and other resources to the crm and other bpo services provided to our higher margin clients 
we bill monthly for our services in a variety of manners  including per minute  per contact  per hour and per full time employee equivalent

a substantial portion of our costs are incurred and paid in philippine pesos 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk of an increase in the value of the philippine peso relative to the us dollar  which would increase the value of our expenses when measured in us dollars

we are also doing business in central america but do not yet hedge currencies from these countries 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results may differ from estimates 
such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents equipment and fixtures equipment and fixtures are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
furniture and fixtures are depreciated over a five year life  software over a three to five year life and equipment generally over a three to five year life 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the associated lease 
assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease 
amortization expense is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease and is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the carrying value of equipment and fixtures to be held and used is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with authoritative guidance 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets 
occasionally  we redeploy equipment and fixtures from underutilized centers to other locations to improve capacity utilization if it is determined that the related undiscounted future cash flows in the underutilized centers would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of these assets 
we estimate fair value of our asset retirement obligations  if any  associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets such as property and equipment when the long lived asset is acquired  constructed  developed or through normal operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that an asset might be impaired 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we operate in one reporting unit  which is the basis for impairment testing and the allocation of acquired goodwill 
intangible assets with a finite life are recorded at cost and amortized using their projected cash flows over their estimated useful life 
client lists and relationships are amortized over periods up to ten years  market adjustments related to facility leases are amortized over the term of the respective lease and developed software is amortized over five years 
brands and trademarks are not amortized as their life is indefinite 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the carrying value of intangibles is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition does not exceed its carrying amount 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets 
stock based compensation at december  and  we had a stock based compensation plan for employees and directors 
for share based payments  the fair value of each grant  including both the time based grants and the performance based grants  is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation 
table of contents model 
with the exception of one grant to r scott murray  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer that was valued using a monte carlo simulation and assumes the performance goals will be achieved 
if such goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized cost is reversed 
stock compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term  net of an estimated future forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate assumption as of december  and is based on historical experience 
income taxes we recognize income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance  which requires recognition of deferred assets and liabilities for the future income tax consequence of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax  using the enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets whenever we believe it is more likely than not  based on available evidence  that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
further we provide for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and the impact of a tax position in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
contingencies we consider the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including non income tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in accordance with the authoritative guidance  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance on business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how we recognize and measure in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determine what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the business combinations guidance also requires acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs to be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
this guidance applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted the business combination guidance on january  our nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include assets and liabilities acquired in connection with a business combination  goodwill and intangible assets 
we adopted the fair value measurement guidance as it relates to these assets and liabilities on january  in april  the fasb issued additional guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions 
the new guidance requires an evaluation of whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability 
if there has been a significant decrease in activity  transactions or quoted prices may not be indicative of fair value and a significant adjustment may need to be made to those prices to estimate fair value 
additionally  an entity must consider whether the observed transaction was orderly that is  not 
table of contents distressed or forced 
if the transaction was orderly  the obtained price can be considered a relevant  observable input for determining fair value 
if the transaction is not orderly  other valuation techniques must be used when estimating fair value 
this guidance  which was applied by us prospectively as of june   did not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position for the year ended december  in april  the fasb issued guidance on determining the useful life of intangible assets 
the intent of the guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
this guidance requires an entity to disclose information for a recognized intangible asset that enables users of the financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted this guidance on january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on subsequent events which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is based on the same principles as currently exist in auditing standards and was issued by the fasb to include accounting guidance that originated as auditing standards into the body of authoritative literature issued by the fasb 
the standard addresses the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
we adopted this guidance during the quarterly period ended june  unaudited pro forma and adjusted pro forma financial information the following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the consolidated results of operations of sgs and egs as if the acquisition of egs had occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented below 
the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to events that are directly attributable to the combination including amortization of purchased intangible assets and debt costs associated with acquisition  debt costs associated with high yield debt offering and conversion of preferred stock to common stock  and in case of the pro forma statements of operations  have a recurring impact 
the unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended  and should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition or the results that would have occurred had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period 
revenue net income loss attributable to common shareholders basic and diluted net loss per share in the fourth quarter of  the former etelecare business generated revenue of million and a net loss of million 
egs was acquired on october  and thus its results of operations are included in the actual results of sgs for the period october  to december  the acquisition of shc in july was our first business combination and  accordingly  we do not believe a historical comparison of the results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december  compared to december  and december  compared to december  are beneficial to our stockholders

table of contents december   and  we are presenting in management s discussion and analysis section below the pro forma results of operations for sgs and shc for the year ended december  as if the acquisition of shc occurred on january  we derived the pro forma results of operations from i the consolidated financial statements of shc for the period from january  to july  the date of the shc acquisition and ii our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  we are presenting the pro forma information in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of our operating results with prior periods 
the pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results of operations that may have actually occurred had the merger taken place on the dates noted  or the future financial position or operating results of shc 
the pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable and provide useful information to the reader of this section 
the pro forma adjustments include adjustments for interest expense  reversal of interest income for sgs  amortization of intangible assets  transaction costs  depreciation expense for assets written up and market lease amortization

we bill monthly for our services in a variety of manners  including per minute  per contact  per hour and per full time employee equivalent 
certain customer contracts contain provisions under which we can earn bonuses or pay penalties on a monthly basis based upon performance 
direct cost of revenue we record the costs specifically associated with client programs as direct cost of revenues 
these costs include direct labor wages and benefits of service professionals as well as reimbursable expenses such as telecommunication charges 
the most significant portion of our direct cost of revenue is attributable to employee compensation  benefits and payroll taxes 
these costs are expensed as they are incurred 
direct costs are affected by prevailing wage rates in the countries in which they are incurred and are subject to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of all expenses of operations other than direct costs of revenue  such as information technology  telecommunications  sales and marketing costs  finance  human resource management and other functions and service center operational expenses such as facilities  operations and training and depreciation and amortization

we do not operate in any countries subject to hyper inflationary accounting treatment 
our most common transaction currencies are the us dollar  the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound  philippine peso and the indian rupee 
our customers are most commonly billed in the us dollar or the euro 
we report our operating results using the average actual exchange rates in effect during the accounting period 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires recognition of deferred assets and liabilities for the future income tax consequence of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax  using the enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets whenever we believe it is more likely than not  based on available evidence  that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
further this guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority

income taxes increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  foreign tax expense comprised million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in and the effective foreign tax rate increased from to 
the increase in expense was driven by a million charge in respect to additional foreign tax liabilities  higher income in foreign jurisdictions offset by the decrease in the effective rate reflecting changes in the mix of operations 
we operate in a number of countries outside the us that are generally taxed at lower rates and this can have a significant impact on the effective tax rate 
net income loss 
net loss decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to increased revenue and margins offset by increased income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital associated with the expenses we incur in performing services under our client contracts and capital expenditures for the opening of new service centers  including the purchase of computers and related equipment 
we have in place a credit facility that consists of a revolving line of credit that allows us to manage our cash flows 
our ability to make payments on the credit facility  to replace our indebtedness  and to fund working capital and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
we have secured our working capital facility through our accounts receivable and therefore  our ability to continue servicing debt is dependent upon the timely collection of those receivables 
we made capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  as compared to million on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  we continue to make capital expenditures to build new service centers  meet new contract requirements and maintain and upgrade our technology 
we expect to continue to expand into new facilities in that might include places such as the philippines  egypt  tunisia  china and south and central america 
we also expect to invest in technology initiatives such as unified communications and enabling technology  business continuity and data security  web based solutions and applications and distributed collaboration networking 
the convergence of voice and data as well as the demand for real time diagnostics and analytics by our clients are requiring us to make substantial future investments in technology and solutions that will require additional capital investments

the abl credit facility has a maturity of four years 
letters of credit 
we have certain standby letters of credit for the benefit of landlords of certain sites in the united states and canada 
as of december   we had approximately million of these letters of credit in place under our amended credit agreement and approximately million of letters of credit under the reimbursement agreement with ares described above in this liquidity and capital resources section 
contractual obligations 
we have various contractual obligations that will affect our liquidity 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations revolving debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total certain facility leases were backed by letters of credit totaling approximately million at december  the obligations under the letters of credit decline annually as the underlying obligations are satisfied 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and working capital measured by current assets less current liabilities of million 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the million used in the year ended december  non cash charges were million greater in the year ended december  than those generated in the period ended december  primarily as a result of the million increase for the depreciation and amortization of acquired assets related to the purchases of shc and egs 
the increase of million in changes from operating assets and liabilities is due primarily to the increase of million in cash used for other assets 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  a million decrease from the million provided by the period ended december  this is primarily attributable cash acquired in the acquisition of egs in as opposed to where the acquisition of shc was paid for in cash 
we used million for additions to equipment and fixtures  net for the year ended december  as compared to million use of cash for the year ended december  
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   a million increase from the million of cash used in financing activities for the period ended december  the increase is due to activity which had proceeds from issuance of the series a preferred stock offset by cash used to purchase shares of common stock in our self tender offer and the proceeds from the sale of units in our ipo in the period ended december  our foreign exchange forward contracts require the exchange of foreign currencies for us dollars or vice versa  and generally mature in one to months 
we had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with aggregate notional amounts of million as of december  and million as of december  we are studying site rationalization as a consequence of the egs acquisition and this may result in future charges to operations and the use of cash 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditures for the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality we are exposed to seasonality in our revenues because of the nature of certain consumer based clients 
we may experience approximately increased volume associated with the peak processing needs in the fourth quarter coinciding with the holiday period and a somewhat seasonal overflow into the first quarter of the following calendar year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates we exposes ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our debt facilities since some of those instruments  including capital leases  bear interest at variable rates 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings under variable debt agreements that totaled approximately million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate would have increased interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased annual cash flow by a comparable amount 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using our service centers in canada  india  the dominican republic  el salvador  egypt  the philippines  nicaragua and costa rica 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in the local currency of the country in which the contracts are serviced which creates foreign exchange exposure 
we serve most of our emea based clients using our service centers in the 
table of contents netherlands  the united kingdom  italy  ireland  spain  sweden  france  germany  poland  denmark  bulgaria  egypt  tunisia and south africa 
we typically bill our emea based clients in euro or british pound sterling 
while a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in euro  a part is also denominated in the local currency in which the contracts are serviced which creates foreign exchange exposure 
the expenses from these foreign operations create exposure to changes in exchange rates between the local currencies and the contractual currencies primarily the us dollar and euro 
as a result  we may experience foreign currency gains and losses  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
the majority of this exposure is related to work performed from call centers in canada  india and the philippines 
in order to manage the risk of these foreign currencies from strengthening against the currency used for billing  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of these foreign currency exposures 
while our hedging strategy may protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall strengthening of the foreign currencies would adversely impact margins over the long term 
the following summarizes the relative weakening strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency during the years presented year ended december  us dollar vs 
canadian dollar us dollar vs 
euro us dollar vs 
indian rupee us dollar vs 
philippine peso us dollar vs 
s 
african rand us dollar vs 
us pound sterling cash flow hedging program substantially all of our subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency as a result of paying labor and operating costs in those local currencies 
certain of our subsidiaries in the philippines use the us dollar as their functional currency while paying their labor and operating cost in local currency 
conversely  revenue for most of these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in us dollars and other foreign currencies 
to mitigate against the risk of principally a weaker us dollar we purchase forward contracts to acquire the local currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future 
we have designated and account for certain of these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges where applicable  as defined by the authoritative guidance 
given the significance of our foreign operations and the potential volatility of the certain of these currencies versus the us dollar  we use forward purchases of philippine peso  canadian dollars and indian rupees to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had entered into forward contracts with three financial institutions to acquire a total of approximately million at prices ranging from to php usd 
we do not hedge any currencies related to our emea operation 
while we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions  as this is part of transacting business in an international environment 
not every exposure is or can be hedged and  where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure  they are based on 
table of contents forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate 
failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could affect our consolidated operating results 
market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
changes in market rates may impact the banks libor rate or prime rate 
for instance  if either the libor or prime rate were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our total credit facility
