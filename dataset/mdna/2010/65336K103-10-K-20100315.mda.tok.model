part i item business overview we are a television broadcasting company focused exclusively on the acquisition  development and operation of television stations in medium sized markets in the united states  primarily markets that rank from to out of the generally recognized television markets  as reported by ac nielsen company 
as of december   we owned and operated stations  and provided sales or other services to an additional stations that are owned by mission and other entities 
in of the markets that we serve  we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to more than one station 
we refer to these markets as duopoly markets 
the stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to are in markets located in new york  pennsylvania  illinois  indiana  missouri  texas  louisiana  arkansas  alabama  utah  florida  montana  rhode island and maryland 
these stations are diverse in their network affiliations have primary affiliation agreements with one of the four major networks with fox  with nbc  with abc and with cbs 
six of the remaining stations have primary agreements with mynetworktv  four stations have an agreement with the cw  one station has an agreement with this tv and one station has an agreement with azteca america 
additionally  three of the stations have secondary network affiliations that are broadcast over digital multicasts dm s one with mynetworktv  one with rtn and one with telemundo 
on october   nexstar broadcasting  inc announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of kwbf the mynetworktv affiliate serving the little rock  arkansas market for million from equity broadcasting corp 
in february  the station was re launched under the call letters karz tv 
closing of the acquisition occurred on march  as of january   kbtv in beaumont  texas became a fox affiliate 
kbtv s nbc network affiliation expired on december  on january   nexstar entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of wcwj  the cw affiliate serving the jacksonville  florida market 
this transaction closed on may  on march  we announced entry into an agreement with four points media group holdings llc four points  owned by an affiliate of cerberus capital management  lp  whereby nexstar broadcasting provides management services for four points seven television stations located in four markets 
under the terms of the agreement  nexstar receives a fixed annual management fee of million per year  as well as annual incentive compensation based on increases of the broadcast cash flow of four points stations 
the agreement provides for minimum compensation to nexstar of million if the four points stations are sold during the initial three year term of the agreement 
the agreement was effective beginning march  we believe that medium sized markets offer significant advantages over large sized markets  most of which result from a lower level of competition 
first  because there are fewer well capitalized acquirers with a medium market focus  we have been successful in purchasing stations on more favorable terms than acquirers of large market stations 
second  in the majority of our markets five or fewer local commercial television stations exist 
as a result  we achieve lower programming costs than stations in larger markets because the supply of quality programming exceeds the demand 
the stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free over the air programming to our markets television viewing audiences 
this programming includes a programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated  b programs that the stations produce  and c first run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire 
our primary source of revenue is the sale of commercial air time to local and national advertisers 
we seek to grow our revenue and broadcast cash flow by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to 
we strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news  local sports coverage and active community sponsorship 
we seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high quality local sales force that leverages the stations strong local brand and community presence with local advertisers 
additionally  we further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs 
the benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by broadcasting the programming of multiple networks  capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency 
as a result of our operational enhancements  we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations 
we completed our initial public offering on november  concurrent with our offering  we completed a corporate reorganization whereby our predecessor  nexstar broadcasting group  llc  and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of nexstar broadcasting group  llc merged with and into us 
nexstar broadcasting group  llc was organized as a limited liability company on december  in the state of delaware and commenced operations on april  our principal offices are at n

operating strategy we seek to generate revenue and broadcast cash flow growth through the following strategies develop leading local franchises 
each of the stations that we own  operate  program  or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand  primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence 
based on internally generated analysis  we believe that in approximately two thirds of our markets that feature local newscasts produced by nexstar  we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership 
strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty  which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news 
high ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own  operate  program  or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers 
for the year ended december  we earned approximately one fourth of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming 
as of december   our stations and the stations we provide services to provided approximately hours per week of local news programming 
extensive local sports coverage and active sponsorship of community events further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal 
emphasize local sales 
we employ a high quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and emedia platform 
we believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers  giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source 
additionally  local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters 
for the year ended december   revenue generated from local advertising represented of our consolidated broadcast revenue total of local and national advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue 
in most of our markets  we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force 
we also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period 
operate duopoly markets 
owning or providing services to more than one station in a market enables us to broaden our audience share  enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies 
duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics 
these markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces 
additionally  we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities  eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations 
we derived approximately of our net broadcast revenue for the year ended december  from our duopoly markets 
maintain strict cost controls 
we emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase broadcast cash flow 
we continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations we provide services to and our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors 
by leveraging our size and corporate management expertise  we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming  financial  sales and marketing support to our stations and the stations we provide services to 
our and mission s cash broadcast payments were    and of net broadcast revenue for the years ended december     and  respectively 
capitalize on diverse network affiliations 
we currently own  operate  program  or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations  including nbc  cbs  abc  and fox affiliated stations which represented approximately   and respectively  of our net broadcast revenue 
the networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as nba basketball  major league baseball  nfl football  ncaa sports  pga golf and the olympic games 
because network programming and ratings change frequently  the diversity of our station portfolio s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network 
attract and retain high quality management 
we seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets 
our station general managers have been granted stock options and have an average of over years of experience in the television broadcasting industry 
acquisition strategy we selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations primarily in markets ranking from to out of the generally recognized television markets  where we believe we can improve revenue and cash flow through active management 
when considering an acquisition  we evaluate the target audience share  revenue share  overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters 
additionally  we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets 
the october  amendment to our senior credit facility specifically restricts our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy 
relationship with mission through various local service agreements with mission  we currently provide sales  programming and other services to television stations that are owned and operated by mission 
mission is owned by an independent third party 
we do not own mission or any of its television stations 
in order for both us and mission to comply with federal communications commission fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
however  as a result of a local service agreements nexstar has with the mission stations  b nexstar s guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility and c purchase options which expire on various dates between and granted by mission s sole shareholder which will permit nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  we are deemed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission 
as a result of our controlling financial interest in mission under us gaap and in order to present fairly our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  we consolidate the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of mission with us as if mission were a wholly owned entity 
we expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration

although nexstar owns wlyh  this station is programmed by newport television pursuant to a time brokerage agreement 
industry background commercial television broadcasting began in the united states on a regular basis in the s 
currently a limited number of channels are available for over the air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the fcc 
all television stations in the country are grouped by ac nielsen company  a national audience measuring service  into generally recognized television markets  known as designated market areas dmas  that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience 
each dma is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours 
ac nielsen periodically publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in the dma 
the estimates are expressed in terms of a rating  which is a station s percentage of the total potential audience in the market  or a share  which is the station s percentage of the audience actually watching television 
a station s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates 
most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming  including prime time hours  from networks 
whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks nbc  abc  cbs or fox has a significant impact on the composition of the station s revenue  expenses and operations 
network programming  along with cash payments for some nbc  abc and cbs affiliates  is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the network s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs 
the network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue 
the affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non network programs 
broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations and cable satellite television systems  as well as with newspapers  radio stations and internet advertising serving the same market 
non commercial  religious and spanish language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers 
in addition  the internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations 
the television broadcast industry transitioned to an advanced digital television dtv transmission system on june  dtv transmissions deliver improved video and audio signals including high definition television and have substantial multiplexing and data transmission capabilities 
as of june   television broadcasters were required to cease analog broadcasting and return one of their channels to the fcc 
advertising sales general television station revenue is primarily derived from the sale of local and national advertising 
all network affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations 
stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non network programming  retaining all of the revenue received from these sales 
a national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming 
these programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming 
advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks  or advertise nationwide on a case by case basis 
national advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms 
local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the stations local sales staff 
advertising rates are based upon a number of factors  including a program s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target  the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station  the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area  the effectiveness of the station s sales forces  development of projects  features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming  and the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser 
advertising rates are also determined by a station s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area  as well as the station s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting 
advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies 
conversely  declines in advertising budgets of advertisers  particularly in recessionary periods  adversely affect the broadcast industry and as a result may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations 
seasonality advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns  and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years due to advertising placed by candidates for political offices and advertising aired during the olympic games 
local sales local advertising time is sold by each station s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses  which typically include car dealerships  retail stores and restaurants 
compared to revenue from national advertising accounts  revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable 
we seek to attract new advertisers to television and our emedia platform and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties  producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co promoting local events and activities 
we place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on going training program for sales personnel 
national sales national advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies  whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups  telecommunications companies  fast food franchisers  and national retailers some of which may advertise locally

which maintain the network affiliation agreements 
although whag is located within the washington  dc dma  its signal does not reach the entire washington  dc metropolitan area 
whag serves the hagerstown  md sub market within the dma 
under a time brokerage agreement  nexstar allows newport television license  llc  inc to program most of wlyh s broadcast time  sell its advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to nexstar 
each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated 
in exchange  the network has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts 
in addition  some stations receive compensation from the network based on the hours of network programming they broadcast 
we expect all of the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration 
competition competition in the television industry takes place on several levels competition for audience  competition for programming and competition for advertising 
audience 
we compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity 
the popularity of a station s programming has a direct effect on the adverting rates it can charge its advertisers 
a portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated 
in those periods  the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers 
stations program non network time periods with a combination of self produced news  public affairs and other entertainment programming  including movies and syndicated programs 
the major television networks have also begun to sell their programming directly to the consumer via portable digital devices such as video ipods and cell phones which presents an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share 
other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems  such as vcrs  dvds and dvrs  video on demand and pay per view  the internet  and television game devices 
although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the abc  nbc  cbs and fox television networks  other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems  such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite dbs systems which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market  have become significant competitors for the over the air television audience 
programming 
competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first run and rerun packages of programming 
stations compete against in market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off network reruns such as seinfeld and first run product such as entertainment tonight in their respective markets 
cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming  although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations 
time warner  inc  general electric company  viacom inc  the news corporation limited and the walt disney company each owns a television network and also owns or controls major production studios  which are the primary source of programming for the networks 
it is uncertain whether in the future such programming  which is generally subject to short term agreements between the studios and the networks  will be moved to the networks 
television broadcasters also compete for non network programming unique to the markets they serve 
as such  stations strive to provide exclusive news stories  unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events 
advertising 
stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets  and other advertising media such as newspapers  radio stations  magazines  outdoor advertising  transit advertising  yellow page directories  direct mail  local cable systems  dbs systems and the internet 
competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets 
generally  a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas 
additional competitive factors 
the broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media 
further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 
the increased use of digital technology by cable systems and dbs  along with video compression techniques  will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission 
these technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems  including over the air broadcasting  and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences 
reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming 
this ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures 
we are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations we provide services to 
federal regulation television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc under the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the following is a brief discussion of certain provisions of the communications act and the fcc s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations 
over the years  congress and the fcc have added  amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject 
some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole 
the following discussion summarizes some of the statutory and regulatory rules and policies currently in effect 
for more information about the nature and extent of fcc regulation of television broadcast stations you should refer to the communications act and the fcc s rules  public notices and policies 
license grant and renewal 
the communications act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the fcc 
television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest  the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules  and the licensee committed no other violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
a majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard 
if a licensee fails to meet this standard the fcc may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate  including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight year period 
after a renewal application is filed  interested parties  including members of the public  may file petitions to deny a renewal application  to which the licensee renewal applicant is entitled to respond 
after reviewing the pleadings  if the fcc determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest  the fcc is required to hold a trial type hearing on the issues presented 
if  after the hearing  the fcc determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard the fcc will grant the renewal application 
if the licensee renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions  the fcc can deny the renewal application 
in the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application  the fcc ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing 
no competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application 
in addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application  the fcc may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe fcc rules and policies during the license term  including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture 
the communications act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior fcc approval 
ownership restrictions 
the communications act limits the extent of non us ownership of companies that own non us broadcast stations 
under this restriction  a us broadcast company such as ours may have no more than non us ownership by vote and by equity 
the fcc also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations 
these ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other entity 
in the case of corporations  officers  directors and voting stock interests of or more or more in the case of qualified investment companies  such as insurance companies and bank trust departments are considered attributable interests 
for partnerships  all general partners and non insulated limited partners are attributable 
limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships 
the fcc also considers attributable the holder of more than of a licensee s total assets defined as total debt plus total equity  if that person or entity also provides over of the station s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the fcc s ownership rules  such as a radio or television station  cable television system or daily newspaper 
local ownership duopoly rule 
under the current duopoly rule  a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if the two stations do not have overlapping service areas  or after the combination there are at least eight independently owned and operating full power television stations and one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the dma 
the duopoly rule allows the fcc to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station only in cases where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt 
under the duopoly rule  the fcc attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in market station when one station owner programs a second in market station pursuant to a time brokerage or local marketing agreement  if the programmer provides more than of the second station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  local marketing agreements entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests until the fcc determines otherwise 
this grandfathered period  when reviewed by the fcc  is subject to possible extension or termination 
in certain markets  we and mission own and operate both full power and low power television broadcast stations in utica  nexstar owns and operates wfxv and wpny lp  in wichita falls  mission owns and operates kjtl and kjbo lp  and in amarillo  mission owns and operates kcit and kcpn lp 
the fcc s duopoly rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full power television stations and not low power television stations such as wpny lp  kjbo lp and kcpn lp 
the only markets in which we currently are permitted to own two stations under the duopoly rule are the champaign springfield decatur  illinois market and the little rock pine bluff  arkansas market 
however  we also are permitted to own two stations in the fort smith fayetteville springdale rogers market pursuant to a waiver under the fcc s rules permitting common ownership of a satellite television station in a market where a licensee also owns the primary station 
in all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements  except for two  we do not provide programming other than news comprising less than of the second station s programming to the second station and  therefore  we are not attributed with ownership of the second station 
in the two markets where we provide more programming to the second station wfxp in erie  pennsylvania and khmt in billings  montana the local marketing agreements were entered into prior to november  therefore  we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the rule is changed 
national ownership 
there is no nationwide limit on the number of television stations which a party may own 
however  the communications act and fcc s rules limit the percentage of us television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 
the stations that nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of 
radio television cross ownership rule one to a market rule 
in markets with at least independently owned media outlets  ownership of one television station and up to seven radio stations  or two television stations if allowed under the television duopoly rule and six radio stations is permitted 
if the number of independently owned media outlets is fewer than but greater than or equal to  ownership of one television station or two if allowed and four radio stations is permitted 
in markets with fewer than independent media voices  ownership of one television station or two if allowed and one radio station is permitted 
in calculating the number of independent media voices in a market  the fcc includes all radio and television stations  independently owned cable systems counted as one voice  and independently owned daily newspapers which have circulation that exceeds of the households in the market 
local television newspaper cross ownership rule 
under this rule  a party is prohibited from having an attributable interest in a television station and a daily newspaper except in cases where the market at issue is one of the largest dmas  and subject to other criteria and limitations 
as a result of the fcc s rulemaking proceeding  which provided a comprehensive review of all of its media ownership rules  in february  the fcc adopted modest changes to its newspaper cross ownership rule  while retaining the rest of its rules as then currently in effect 
multiple challenges to this proceeding were filed with the us court of appeals  which remain pending 
sometime during  the fcc is expected to officially initiate the next statutorily mandated review of its media ownership rules and request public comments thereon 
local television cable cross ownership 
there is no fcc rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area 
cable must carry or retransmission consent rights 
every three years television broadcasters are required to make an election between must carry or retransmission consent rights in connection with the carriage of their signal on cable television systems within their dma 
for a majority of our and mission s stations the most recent election was made october   for the three year period beginning january  if a broadcaster chooses to exercise its must carry rights  it may request cable system carriage on its over the air channel or another channel on which it was carried on the cable system as of a specified date 
a cable system generally must carry the station s signal in compliance with the station s carriage request  and in a manner that makes the signal available to all cable subscribers 
however  must carry rights are not absolute  and whether a cable system is required to carry the station on its system  or in the specific manner requested  depends on variables such as the location  size and number of activated channels of the cable system and whether the station s programming duplicates  or substantially duplicates the programming of another station carried on the cable system 
if certain conditions are met  a cable system may decline to carry a television station that has elected must carry status  although it is unusual for all the required conditions to exist 
if a broadcaster chooses to exercise its retransmission consent rights  a cable television system which is subject to that election may not carry the station s signal without the station s consent 
this generally requires the cable system and television station operator to negotiate the terms under which the broadcaster will consent to the cable system s carriage of its station s signal 
we and mission have elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of our stations where we have a legal right to do so 
we and mission have negotiated retransmission consent agreements with substantially all of the cable systems which carry the stations signals 
direct to home satellite services and carriage rights 
direct broadcast satellite dbs providers are permitted to carry local channels  including significantly viewed out of market stations when local service is provided 
under certain circumstances  dbs providers also are permitted to provide network service from a station outside a local market for subscribers in the market who are unserved by a local station affiliated with the same network 
in addition  dbs subscribers who were not receiving a digital signal as of december  may receive distant signals for digital television programming from their dbs provider if they were receiving the local analog signal of a network affiliate and the subscriber cannot receive a local digital signal of that network affiliated station over the air 
satellite carriers that provide any local into local service in a market must carry  upon request  all stations in that market that have elected mandatory carriage  and dbs operators are now carrying other local stations in local into local markets  including some noncommercial  independent and foreign language stations 
however  satellite carriers are not required to carry duplicative network signals from a local market unless the stations are licensed to different communities in different states 
satellite carriers are required to carry all local television stations in a contiguous manner on their channel line up and may not discriminate in their carriage of stations 
commercial television stations make elections between retransmission consent and must carry status for satellite services on the same schedule as cable elections  with the most recent elections made by october  for the three year period that began on january  directv currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations in the champaign springfield decatur  evansville  ft 
smith fayetteville springdale rogers  ft 
wayne  jacksonville  johnstown altoona  little rock pine bluff  peoria bloomington  rochester  rockford  shreveport  springfield and wilkes barre scranton markets 
dish network currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations in the abilene sweetwater  amarillo  beaumont port arthur  billings  champaign springfield decatur  dothan  erie  evansville  fort wayne  ft 
smith fayetteville springdale rogers  hagerstown  jacksonville  johnstown altoona  joplin  mo pittsburg  ks  little rock pine bluff  lubbock  monroe  la el dorado  ar  odessa midland  peoria bloomington  rochester  rockford  san angelo  shreveport  springfield  terre haute  wichita falls  tx lawton  ok and wilkes barre scranton markets 
we and mission have long term carriage agreements with both directv expiring in and dish network formerly echostar expiring in that provide for the carriage of the currently carried stations  as well as those subsequently added in new local to local markets  or those added by acquisition or other means 
digital television dtv 
in february  president obama signed into law legislation that established june  as the deadline for television broadcasters to complete their transition to dtv only operations and return their analog spectrum to the fcc 
the dtv transmission system delivers video and audio signals of higher quality including high definition television than the existing analog transmission system 
dtv also has substantial capabilities for multiplexing the broadcast of several channels of programs concurrently and data transmission 
the introduction of digital television requires consumers to purchase new television sets that are capable of receiving and displaying the dtv signals  or adapters to receive dtv signals and convert them to analog signals for display on their existing receivers 
on june  all full power television broadcasters were required to cease operating in an analog format and operate exclusively in digital dtv format 
as of december   all of nexstar s and mission s stations have completed the transition to digital operations  however  nexstar is working with the fcc with respect to kmid s authorization 
television station operators may use their dtv signals to provide ancillary services  such as computer software distribution  internet access  interactive materials  e commerce  paging services  audio signals  subscription video  or data transmission services 
to the extent a station provides such ancillary services it is subject to the same regulations as are applicable to other analogous services under the fcc s rules and policies 
commercial television stations also are required to pay the fcc of the gross revenue derived from all ancillary services provided over their dtv signals for which a station received a fee in exchange for the service or received compensation from a third party in exchange for transmission of material from that third party  not including commercial advertisements used to support broadcasting 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
television station licensees are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
the fcc may consider complaints from viewers concerning programming when it evaluates a station s license renewal application  although viewer complaints also may be filed and considered by the fcc at any time 
stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things political advertising its price and availability  sponsorship identification  contest and lottery advertising  obscene and indecent broadcasts  technical operations  including limits on radio frequency radiation  discrimination and equal employment opportunities  closed captioning  children s programming  program ratings guidelines  and network affiliation agreements 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees  comprised of  full time and part time or temporary employees 
as of december   of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory  and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities 
however  we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future  or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  which we believe are the most significant risks related to our business  as well as the other information contained in this document 
risks related to our operations the continued economic slowdown in the united states and the national and world wide financial crisis may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
among other things  these negative economic trends could adversely affect demand for television advertising  reduce the availability  and increase the cost  of short term funds for liquidity requirements  and adversely affect our ability to meet long term commitments 
in addition  general trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers turn to alternative media  including the internet  for entertainment 
the continued economic slowdown in the united states is likely to adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows by  among other things  reducing demand for local and national television advertising and making it more difficult for customers to pay their accounts 
moreover  television viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media  including the internet 
as a result  in recent years demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing  and we expect this trend to continue 
our ability to access funds under the nexstar senior credit facility nexstar facility depends  in part  on our compliance with certain financial covenants in the nexstar facility  including covenants based on ebitda as defined in the nexstar facility 
if our ebitda is not sufficient to ensure compliance with these covenants  we might not be able to draw down funds under our revolving credit facility or it might be considered an event of default under the nexstar facility 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as have been experienced during and may continue in  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our bank revolving credit facilities 
our access to funds under the revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from us and other borrowers within a short period of time 
longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and other discretionary uses of cash 
we and mission have a history of net losses 
we and mission had aggregate net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we and mission may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
our substantial debt could limit our ability to grow and compete 
as of december   we and mission had million of debt  which represented of our and mission s total combined capitalization 
the companies high level of debt could have important consequences to our business 
for example  it could limit our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future  limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities  expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under the senior credit facilities is variable  limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and our industry  and impair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature 
we and mission could also incur additional debt in the future 
the terms of our and mission s senior credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt 
to the extent we or mission incur additional debt we would become even more susceptible to the leverage related risks described above 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our business 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our publicly held notes contain various covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  make acquisitions  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios  including consolidated leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios 
future financing agreements may contain similar  or even more restrictive  provisions and covenants 
as a result of these restrictions and covenants  our management s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited  and we may be unable to compete effectively  pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities  any of which could harm our business 
mission s senior credit facility contains similar terms and restrictions 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements  a default may occur 
a default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
a default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt 
our senior credit facility agreement contains covenants which require us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a maximum total and senior leverage ratios  b a minimum interest coverage ratio  and c a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants  which are calculated on a quarterly basis  include the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
mission s senior credit facility agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements  however it does include an event of default if nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement 
the senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type 
as of september   we were in compliance with all indentures governing the publicly held notes 
as of september   we were not in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior credit facility 
on october   we amended our credit facility to modify certain covenants 
see note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion of the credit facility amendment 
the october  amendment contained a limited waiver for the leverage ratios which cured the violation as of september  contained in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the publicly held notes 
on march   we closed an offer to exchange  of the senior subordinated notes due in exchange for  senior subordinated pik notes due the pik notes 
based on the financial covenants in the senior credit facility  the pik notes are not included in the debt amount used to calculate the total leverage ratio until january the industry wide mandatory conversion to digital television could have an adverse impact on our business  as certain viewers that do not upgrade their technology to be able to receive digital signals could no longer be able to view our programming 
television stations in the us transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts and had to phase out analog broadcasting altogether by june  all of our and mission s stations are broadcasting with digital only signals 
tv viewers who receive their signals over the air instead of through multichannel video program distributors  which we refer to as mvpds  such as cable  satellite  or fiber optic service and who have older  analog only television receivers  had to obtain digital to analog converters or new digital televisions and perhaps new antennas in order to continue watching television after june  the federal government established a program to provide eligible tv viewers with coupons to cover the expense of purchasing digital to analog converters but not new antennas 
however  due to technological differences in the way digital as compared to analog tv signals are received  it is possible that some viewers who received adequate analog signals over the air are not able to receive usable digital signals even with digital to analog converters and new antennas and  therefore  are not able to watch some or all of the stations they have been watching unless they subscribe to an mvpd service 
mission may make decisions regarding the operation of its stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements 
mission is owned by an independent third party 
mission owns and operates television stations as of december  we have entered into local service agreements with mission  pursuant to which we provide services to mission s stations 
in return for the services we provide  we receive substantially all of the available cash  after payment of debt service costs  generated by mission s stations 
we also guarantee all of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  which were incurred primarily in connection with mission s acquisition of its stations 
the sole shareholder of mission has granted to us a purchase option to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or the amount of its indebtedness 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with mission  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission while complying with the fcc s rules regarding ownership limits in television markets 
in order for both us and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over the programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
as a result  mission s sole shareholder and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and  as a consequence  the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with mission 
for instance  we may disagree with mission s programming decisions  which programming may prove unpopular and or may generate less advertising revenue 
furthermore  subject to mission s agreement with its lenders  mission s sole shareholder could choose to pay himself a dividend 
the revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms  or at all 
due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks  stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market 
as a result  it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations 
all of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements stations have primary affiliation agreements with nbc  with cbs  with abc  with fox  with mynetworktv  with the cw  with this tv and with azteca america 
additionally  three of the stations have secondary affiliation agreements one with mynetworktv  one with rtn and one with telemundo 
each of nbc  cbs  abc  rtn  telemundo  azteca america and this tv generally provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week  while each of fox  mynetworktv and the cw provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  affiliated stations broadcast the respective network s commercials during the network programming 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  some of the stations we operate or provide services to also receive compensation from these networks 
all of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times beginning in may through august network affiliation agreements are also subject to earlier termination by the networks under limited circumstances 
for more information regarding these network affiliation agreements  see business network affiliations 
the loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
nexstar s retransmission consent agreements with cable operators  direct broadcast satellite operators  and others permit the operators to carry our stations signals in exchange for the payment of compensation to us from the system operators as consideration 
the television networks have recently asserted to their local television station affiliates the networks position that they  as the owners or licensees of programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission  are entitled to a portion of the compensation under the retransmission consent agreements 
networks have proposed to include these provisions in their network affiliation agreements 
inclusion of these or similar provisions in our network affiliation agreements could materially reduce this revenue source to nexstar and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the fcc could decide not to grant renewal of the fcc license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations 
television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc is required to grant an application for license renewal if  during the preceding term  the station served the public interest  the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules  and the licensee committed no other violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
a majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard 
if a licensee fails to meet this standard the fcc may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate  including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight year period 
on october   the director of the central illinois chapter of the parents television council ptc submitted an informal objection to the application for renewal of license for nexstar s station wcia in champaign  illinois  requesting the fcc withhold action on wcia s license renewal application until the fcc acts on the ptc s complaint regarding an allegedly indecent broadcast on wcia 
on january   cable america corporation submitted a petition to deny the applications for renewal of license for nexstar s station ksfx and mission s station kolr  both licensed to springfield  missouri 
cable america alleged that nexstar s local service agreements with mission give nexstar improper control over mission s operations 
nexstar and mission submitted a joint opposition to this petition to deny and cable america submitted a reply 
cable america subsequently requested that the fcc dismiss its petition 
however  the petition remains pending with the fcc 
nexstar and mission began to submit renewal of license applications for their stations beginning in june we and mission expect the fcc to renew the licenses for our stations in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the fcc will do so 
the loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of perry a 
sook  our founder and president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus 
the loss of mr 
sook s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations 
the television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation  which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets 
therefore  even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets  we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful 
on october   we amended our credit facility and the amendment also specifically restricts our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy 
fcc rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire additional television stations 
television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions if  for example  the fcc or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our growth  our operating results will suffer 
since january   we have more than doubled the number of stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to  having acquired stations and contracted to provide service to additional stations 
we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities 
to manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions  we will need  among other things  to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems 
we will also need to continue to identify  attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel 
failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business 
there are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that we may not be able to successfully reduce costs  increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station  an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities  our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business  we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems  as well as company policies and cultures  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
fcc actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements  which would harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy 
in some of our markets  we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements 
while these agreements take varying forms  a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station s owner 
by operating or entering into local service agreements with more than one station in a market  we and the other station achieve significant operational efficiencies 
we also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market 
while all of our existing local service agreements comply with fcc rules and policies  the fcc may not continue to permit local service agreements as a means of creating duopoly type opportunities 
on august   the fcc initiated a rule making proceeding to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable under its ownership rules 
comments and reply comments were filed in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of the fcc has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding 
however  if the fcc adopts a joint sales agreement attribution rule for television stations we will be required to comply with the rule 
the fcc may decide to terminate grandfathered time brokerage agreements 
the fcc attributes time brokerage agreements and local marketing agreements tbas to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides more than of a station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  tbas entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests for now 
the fcc will review these grandfathered tbas in the future 
during this review  the fcc may determine to terminate the grandfathered period and make all tbas fully attributable to the programmer 
if the fcc does so  we and mission will be required to terminate the tbas for stations wfxp and khmt unless the fcc simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets 
the fcc may fail to grant a construction permit for kmid s digital facilities 
on december   nexstar submitted an application to modify kmid s construction permit to specify a new broadcast tower for kmid s digital operations 
the fcc requested further information regarding this application  which nexstar submitted on september  the fcc has not yet granted kmid s digital authorization  however  the fcc has granted kmid a special temporary authorization for the continued operation of kmid s digital facilities during the pendency of its review 
we believe the fcc will likely grant kmid s digital authorization in the normal course 
however  if the fcc ultimately denies kmid s amended application  nexstar will be required to cease operating kmid s digital facilities 
the level of foreign investments held by our principal stockholder  abry partners  llc and its affiliated funds abry  may limit additional foreign investments made in us 
the communications act limits the extent of non us ownership of companies that own us broadcast stations 
under this restriction  a us broadcast company such as ours may have no more than us ownership by vote and by equity 
because our majority shareholder  abry has a substantial level of foreign investment  the amount of additional foreign investment that may be made in us is limited to approximately of our total outstanding equity 
the interest of our principal stockholder  abry  in other media may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under fcc rules 
the broadcast or other media interest of our officers  directors and stockholders with or greater voting power are generally attributable under the fcc s rules  which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of otherwise non attributable equity and or debt in a licensee in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or daily newspaper in the same market 
abry  our principal stockholder  is one of the largest private firms specializing in media and broadcasting investments 
as a result of abry s interest in us  we could be prevented from acquiring broadcast companies in markets where abry has an attributable interest in television stations or other media  which could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our certificate of incorporation allows abry and its affiliates to identify  pursue and consummate additional acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisitions opportunities may not be available to us 
we are controlled by one principal stockholder  abry  and its interests may differ from your interests 
as a result of abry s controlling interest in us  abry is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs 
abry is able to unilaterally determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  five of our directors are or were affiliated with abry 
abry s interests may differ from the interests of other security holders and abry could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our security holders 
furthermore  this concentration of ownership by abry may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  debt instruments and delaware law contain anti takeover protections that may discourage or prevent a takeover of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us  even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board of directors without a stockholder vote  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and set forth specific advance notice procedures for matters to be raised at stockholder meetings 
the delaware general corporation law prohibits us from engaging in business combinations with interested shareholders with some exceptions unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner 
the existence of this provision could have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
in addition  a change in control would be an event of default under our senior credit facility and trigger the rights of holders of our publicly traded notes to cause us to repurchase such notes 
these events would add to the cost of an acquisition  which could deter a third party from acquiring us 
we and mission have a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets  and therefore we and mission could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges 
as of december   approximately million  or  of our and mission s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets  including fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of that included an impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses of million  related to of our stations and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to four reporting units consisting of five of our television stations 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  that included an impairment to the carrying value of fcc licenses of million  related to of our television stations  an impairment to the carrying value of network affiliation agreements of million related to of our television stations  and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to reporting units consisting of of our television stations 
we and mission test goodwill and fcc licenses annually  and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets  in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
we and mission test network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows 
the methods used to evaluate the impairment of nexstar s and mission s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of nexstar s and mission s television stations  or a forecast of such reductions  a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which nexstar s and mission s television stations operate  the loss of network affiliations  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among others  which may be beyond our or mission s control 
if the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment  such non cash charge could materially affect nexstar s and mission s financial position and results of operations 
risks related to our industry nexstar s operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result  nexstar may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond nexstar s control than businesses not dependent on advertising 
nexstar derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time 
nexstar s ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond nexstar s control  including the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based media  particularly newspapers  cable television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located 
because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns  the reliance upon advertising revenue makes nexstar s operating results particularly susceptible to prevailing economic conditions 
our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership  and we may not achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenue to decline 
in addition  we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate  and effectively react to  shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets 
because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs  primarily for debt service  broadcast rights and personnel 
other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies  our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue 
as a result  a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
preemption of regularly scheduled programming by network news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations 
nexstar may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack 
as a result  advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed upon times in the future 
advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods  and space may not be available for such advertising 
the duration of such preemption of local programming cannot be predicted if it occurs 
in addition  our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
if we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends  our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively 
new technologies could also adversely affect our television stations 
information delivery and programming alternatives such as cable  direct satellite to home services  pay per view  the internet  telephone company services  mobile devices  digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access 
over the past decade  cable television programming services  other emerging video distribution platforms and the internet have captured an increasing market share  while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined 
in addition  the expansion of cable and satellite television  the internet and other technological changes have increased  and may continue to increase  the competitive demand for programming 
such increased demand  together with rising production costs  may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming 
in addition  video compression techniques  now in use with direct broadcast satellites  cable and wireless cable  are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth 
these compression techniques as well as other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems  including over the air broadcasting  and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences 
reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming  resulting in more audience fractionalization 
this ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures 
we are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or on the future results of our television businesses 
if direct broadcast satellite companies do not carry the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share and revenue 
direct broadcast satellite television companies are permitted to transmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers in local markets provided that they offer to carry all local stations in that market 
however  satellite providers have limited satellite capacity to deliver local station signals in local markets 
satellite providers  such as directv and dish network  carry our and mission s stations in only some of our markets and may choose not to carry local stations in any of our other markets 
directv currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations in the champaign springfield decatur  evansville  ft

in those markets in which the satellite providers do not carry local station signals  subscribers to those satellite services are unable to view local stations without making further arrangements  such as installing antennas and switches 
furthermore  when direct broadcast satellite companies do carry local television stations in a market  they are permitted to charge subscribers extra for such service 
some subscribers may choose not to pay extra to receive local television stations 
in the event subscribers to satellite services do not receive the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share which would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
the fcc can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent 
in  the fcc began to impose substantial fines on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the communications act and its rules 
the fcc also revised its indecency review analysis to more strictly prohibit the use of certain language on broadcast television 
because our and mission s stations programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated  we and mission do not have full control over what is broadcast on our stations  and we and mission may be subject to the imposition of fines if the fcc finds such programming to be indecent 
fines may be imposed on a television broadcaster for an indecency violation to a maximum of thousand per violation 
intense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and impair our ability to become profitable 
as a television broadcasting company  we face a significant level of competition  both directly and indirectly 
generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television 
specifically  stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share  programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media  including newspapers  radio stations  cable television  dbs systems and the internet 
the entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
the markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from  among other things  technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view and home video and entertainment systems  have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to increased competition 
we may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions 
we are unable to predict what form of competition will develop in the future  the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our businesses 
the fcc could implement legislation and or regulations that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole 
the fcc has initiated proceedings to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable interests under its ownership rules  to determine whether it should establish formal rules under which broadcasters will be required to serve the local public interest  and to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules  including the radio television cross ownership rule and the newspaper television cross ownership rule 
a change to any of these rules may have significant impact on us and the stations we provide services to 
in addition  the fcc may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties  any of which might have such an impact 
congress also may act to amend the communications act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general 
the fcc may reallocate some portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use which alteration could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming 
the fcc has initiated a proceeding to assess the availability of spectrum to meet future wireless broadband needs pursuant to which the fcc is examining whether some portion of the spectrum currently used for commercial broadcast television can be made available for wireless broadband use 
the fcc has proposed requiring television stations to co locate their antennas and or reducing the amount of spectrum allocated to each television station from megahertz to megahertz 
if the fcc determines to move forward with reducing the spectrum available to television broadcasters for their use  it may render our investment in digital facilities worthless and consequently reduce the useful lives of certain digital equipment  could require substantial additional investment to continue our operations  and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals

therefore  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations includes mission s financial position and results of operations 
executive summary highlights net revenue decreased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily from the decrease in political  local and national advertising revenue  partially offset by an increase in retransmission compensation 
gross political advertising revenue decreased million or for the year ended december  the decrease was attributed to the presidential and statewide and or local races that occurred during  compared to a nominal amount of political advertising in gross local and national advertising revenue on a combined basis decreased million  or during the year ended december  due in large part to decrease in automotive related advertising  our largest advertising category 
emedia revenue increased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of expanding the products offered in this area and increased marketing efforts 
on march   nexstar closed on the acquisition of karz  the mynetworktv affiliate serving little rock  arkansas  for a purchase price of million 
the purchase was for substantially all the assets of the station including broadcast rights  property and equipment  fcc licenses and goodwill and also included broadcast liabilities 
on january   nexstar entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of wcwj  the cw affiliate serving the jacksonville  florida market  for million base subject to working capital adjustments 
the transaction closed on may  on march  we announced entry into an agreement with four points media group llc four points  owned by an affiliate of cerberus capital management  lp  whereby nexstar provides management services for four points seven television stations located in four markets 
under the terms of the agreement  nexstar receives a fixed annual management fee of million  as well as annual incentive compensation based on increases of the broadcast cash flow of four points stations 
the agreement provides for minimum compensation to nexstar of million if the four points stations are sold during the initial three year term of the agreement 
the agreement was effective beginning march  in may  we completed regionalizing certain accounting and traffic functions as part of our efforts to reduce the company s overhead costs 
we estimate this initiative will save the company million annually 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  that included an impairment to the carrying value of fcc licenses of million  related to of our television stations and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to four reporting units consisting of five of our television stations 
during the year ended december   repayments totaling million were made on nexstar s and mission s debt outstanding  of which million was paid to retire million of nexstar s senior discount notes  million was paid to retire million of nexstar s senior subordinated notes  million were revolving loan repayments and million were scheduled term loan maturities 
on march   we completed the exchange of million of senior subordinated notes  due for million of senior subordinated payment in kind pik notes  due as of september   we were in compliance with all indentures governing the publicly held notes 
as of september   we were not in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility 
on october   nexstar amended its senior secured credit facility to modify certain terms of the underlying credit agreement 
the modifications included  but are not limited to  changes to financial covenants  including the consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio  a general tightening of the exceptions to the negative covenants principally by means of reducing the types and amounts of permitted transactions and an increase to the interest rates and fees payable with respect to the borrowings under the amended credit agreement 
the october  debt amendment contained a limited waiver for the leverage ratios which cured the violation as of september  overview of operations we owned and operated television stations as of december  through various local service agreements  we programmed or provided sales and other services to additional television stations  including television stations owned and operated by mission as of december  all of the stations that we program or provide sales and other services to  including mission  are owned by independent third parties 
the following table summarizes the various local service agreements we had in effect as of december  with mission service agreements mission stations tba only wfxp and khmt ssa jsa kjtl  kjbo lp  kolr  kcit  kcpn lp  kamc  krbc  ksan  wutr  wfxw  wyou  kode  wtvo and ktve we have a time brokerage agreement tba with each of these stations which allows us to program most of each station s broadcast time  sell each station s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to mission 
we have both a shared services agreement ssa and a joint sales agreement jsa with each of these stations 
the ssa allows the sharing of services including news production  technical maintenance and security  in exchange for our right to receive certain payments from mission as described in the ssas 
the jsas permit us to sell the station s advertising time and retain a percentage of the net revenue from the station s advertising time in return for monthly payments to mission of the remaining percentage of net revenue  as described in the jsas 
our ability to receive cash from mission is governed by these agreements 
the arrangements under the ssas and jsas have had the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash  after debt service costs  generated by the stations listed above 
the arrangements under the tbas have also had the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash generated by the tba stations listed above 
we anticipate that  through these local service agreements  we will continue to receive substantially all of the available cash  after payments for debt service costs  generated by the stations listed above 
we also guarantee the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility 
similarly  mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes we have issued 
in consideration of our guarantee of mission s senior credit facility  the sole shareholder of mission has granted us a purchase option to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement  or the amount of its indebtedness 
these option agreements which expire on various dates between and are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by the sole shareholder of mission 
we expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with mission  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission while complying with the fcc s rules regarding ownership limits in television markets 
in order for both us and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
the operating revenue of our stations is derived primarily from broadcast advertising revenue  which is affected by a number of factors  including the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate  the demographic makeup of those markets and the marketing strategy we employ in each market 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks 
for the years ended december  and  revenue generated from local advertising represented and  respectively  of our consolidated spot revenue total of local and national advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue 
the remaining advertising revenue represents inventory sold for national or political advertising 
all national and political revenue is derived from advertisements placed through advertising agencies 
the agencies receive a commission rate of of the gross amount of advertising schedules placed by them 
while the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies  some advertisers place their schedules directly with the stations local sales staff  thereby eliminating the agency commission 
each station also has an agreement with a national representative firm that provides for sales representation outside the particular station s market 
advertising schedules received through the national representative firm are for national or large regional accounts that advertise in several markets simultaneously 
national commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each station s agreement 
each of our stations and the stations we provide services to has a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the station during specified time periods  including prime time 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  some of our stations and the stations we provide services to receive cash compensation for distributing the network s programming over the air and for allowing the network to keep a portion of advertising inventory during those time periods 
the affiliation agreements with fox  mynetworktv and the cw do not provide for compensation 
in recent years  in conjunction with the renewal of affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  the amount of network compensation has been declining from year to year 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
therefore  revenue associated with network compensation agreements is expected to decline in future years and may be eliminated altogether at some point in time 
each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non news and non network time periods 
the licenses are either purchased from a program distributor for cash and or the program distributor is allowed to sell some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license 
the latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights 
the station records the estimated fair market value of the licenses  including any advertising inventory given to the program distributor  as a broadcast right asset and liability 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged using historical advertising rates  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the assets are amortized as a component of amortization of broadcast rights 
amortization is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the cash broadcast rights liabilities are reduced by monthly payments while the barter liability is amortized over the life of the contract as barter revenue 
our primary operating expenses consist of commissions on advertising revenue  employee compensation and related benefits  newsgathering and programming costs 
a large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to remains relatively fixed 
seasonality advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies  national and regional political election campaigns  and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
because television broadcast stations rely on advertising revenue  declines in advertising budgets  particularly in recessionary periods  adversely affect the broadcast industry  and as a result may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations 
the stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years resulting from political advertising and advertising aired during the olympic games 
industry trends our net revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in political  local and national advertising revenue 
political advertising revenue was million for the year ended december   a significant decrease from the million for the year ended december  the demand for political advertising is generally higher in even numbered years  when congressional and presidential elections occur  than in odd numbered years when there are no federal elections scheduled 
during an election year  political advertising revenue makes up a significant portion of the increase in revenue in that year 
however  even during an election year  political revenue is influenced by geography and the competitiveness of the election races 
since is another election year  we expect a significant increase in the political advertising revenue to be reported in in relation to the amount of political advertising reported in the decrease in political revenue was accompanied by a decrease in local and national advertising revenue of million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in automotive related advertising  our largest advertising category  which represented approximately and of our core local and national advertising revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our automotive related advertising decreased approximately for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this trend has been primarily due to the current condition of the automotive industry and resulting decline in the demand for advertising from this business category 
the television bureau of advertising has forecasted us television spot advertising revenue total of local and national advertising revenue  excluding political advertising revenue in to increase by approximately to compared to station acquisitions on october   nexstar entered into a purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of karz formerly kwbf  the mynetworktv affiliate serving the little rock  arkansas market for million

the new notes are general unsecured senior subordinated obligations subordinated to all of nexstar broadcasting s senior debt 
nexstar broadcasting pays interest on the new notes on january and july of each year  commencing on july  interest is computed on the basis of a day year of twelve day months 
however  prior to january   the interest on the new notes will not be cash interest 
from the date of issuance through january   nexstar broadcasting pays interest on the new notes entirely by issuing additional new notes the pik interest

gross national advertising revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or 
the combined net decrease in gross local and national advertising revenue of million was largely the result of a million decrease in automotive related advertising  our largest advertising category 
also contributing to the overall decrease in local and national advertising were decreases in the following advertising categories fast food and restaurants million  department stores and retail million  furniture million  paid programming million  medical and healthcare million  and telcom million

gross political advertising revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in gross political revenue was attributed to presidential  statewide and or local races primarily in pennsylvania  indiana  alabama  missouri and montana that occurred during the year ended december  as compared to nominal political advertising during the year ended december  retransmission compensation was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or

the decrease in station direct operating expenses  net of trade and selling  general and administrative expenses  is primarily attributed to decreases in national and local sales commissions resulting from lower national and local revenue and a reduction in payroll related costs due to regionalizing certain accounting and traffic functions in offset in part by the acquisition of wcwj 
amortization of broadcast rights  excluding barter  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of stations wcwj and karz  which included combined write downs of million 
amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily related to the write off of an affiliation agreement in due to one of our stations changing network affiliations in january of and also reductions in carrying values of certain network affiliation agreements that were impaired in the second half of depreciation of property and equipment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized a non cash gain of million and million  respectively from the exchange of equipment under an arrangement with sprint nextel corporation 
the increase in this gain was due to the higher number of stations completing spectrum conversions in compared to in february  nexstar began regionalizing certain accounting and traffic functions 
as a result  approximately employees were notified they would be terminated at various points in time through the end of may these employees were offered termination benefits that aggregated to million 
the company recognized these costs ratably over the period of time between the notice of termination and the termination date 
nexstar estimates the restructuring will save the company approximately million annually 
the company incurred a million charge during related to these benefits 
in  the company incurred a non cash charge of million related to the termination of national sales representation agreements at certain stations 
the company incurred a similar type of charge in in the amount of million related to a different group of stations 
the net gain on asset disposal of million included gains of million and million related to the ksnf and kbtv casualty losses  respectively 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during that included an impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses of million  related to of our television stations and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to four reporting units consisting of five of our television stations 
in  we recorded total impairment charges of million that included an impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses of million  related to of our television stations  an impairment to the carrying value of network affiliation agreements of million  related to three of our television stations  and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to reporting units consisting of of our television stations 
as required by the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we tested our fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment at september   between the required annual tests  because we believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts and that our fcc licenses might be impaired 
these events and circumstances include the overall economic recession and a continued decline in demand for advertising at several of our stations

income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to a benefit of million for the same period in  an increase in expense of million 
the increase was primarily due to the tax benefit recognized as a result of the million impairment charge in compared to the million impairment charge in on indefinite lived assets 
our provision for income taxes is primarily created by an increase in the deferred tax liabilities position during the year arising from the amortizing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for income tax purposes which are not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
the impairment charge reduced the book value and therefore decreased the deferred tax liability position 
no tax benefit was recorded with respect to the losses for and  as the utilization of such losses is not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future

liquidity and capital resources we and mission are highly leveraged  which makes the company vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions 
our and mission s ability to meet the future cash requirements described below depends on our and mission s ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond our and mission s control 
based on current operations and anticipated future growth  we believe that our and mission s available cash  anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditure requirements  interest payments and scheduled debt principal payments for at least the next twelve months 
in order to meet future cash needs we may  from time to time  borrow under credit facilities or issue other long or short term debt or equity  if the market and the terms of our existing debt arrangements permit  and mission may  from time to time  borrow under its available credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate the best use of nexstar s operating cash flow among its capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt reduction

the decrease was due to lower average interest rates incurred during the year ended december  compared to the same period in and a lower level of average debt outstanding in on the respective credit facilities 
the decrease in cash interest paid on bank debt was partially offset by an increase in cash interest paid on the senior discount notes  which required cash payments beginning in april nexstar and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
mission files its own separate federal income tax return 
additionally  nexstar and mission file their own state and local tax returns as are required 
due to our and mission s recent history of net operating losses  we and mission currently do not pay any federal income taxes 
these net operating losses may be carried forward  subject to expiration and certain limitations  and used to reduce taxable earnings in future years 
through the use of available loss carryforwards  it is possible that we and mission may not pay significant amounts of federal income taxes in the foreseeable future

future sources of financing and debt service requirements as of december   nexstar and mission had total combined debt of million  which represented of nexstar and mission s combined capitalization 
our and mission s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes

the terms of the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities  as well as of the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future 
we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
debt covenants our senior secured credit facility agreement contains covenants which require us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a maximum total and senior leverage ratios  b a minimum interest coverage ratio  and c a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants  which are calculated on a quarterly basis  include the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
mission s senior credit facility agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements  however it does include an event of default if nexstar does not comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement 
the senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the publicly held notes 
as of september   we were in compliance with all indentures governing the publicly held notes 
as of september   we were not in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility 
on october   nexstar amended its senior secured credit facility to modify certain terms of the underlying credit agreement 
the modifications included  but are not limited to  changes to financial covenants  including the consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio  a general tightening of the exceptions to the negative covenants principally by means of reducing the types and amounts of permitted transactions and an increase to the interest rates and fees payable with respect to the borrowings under the amended credit agreement 
the october  debt amendment contained a limited waiver for the leverage ratios which cured the violation as of september  the following table compares the old and new covenant requirements 
prior as amended consolidated total leverage ratio july  through september  to to october  to december  to to january  through march  to to april  through june  to to july  through september  to to october  through and including march  to to april  and thereafter to to consolidated senior leverage ratio july  through september  to to october  to december  to to january  through march  to to april  through june  to to july  through september  to to october  through and including march  to to april  and thereafter to to the amended nexstar credit agreement revises the calculation of consolidated total leverage ratio to exclude the netting of cash and cash equivalents against total debt 
on an annual basis following the delivery of nexstar s broadcasting  inc s year end financial statements  the amended nexstar credit agreement requires mandatory prepayments of principal  as well as a permanent reduction in revolving credit commitments  subject to a computation of excess cash flow for the preceding fiscal year 
the amended agreement also places additional restrictions on the use of proceeds from asset sales  equity issuances  or debt issuances with the result that such proceeds  subject to certain exceptions  be used for mandatory prepayments of principal and permanent reductions in revolving credit commitments  and includes an anti cash hoarding provision which requires that the company utilize unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of million to repay principal amounts outstanding  but not permanently reduce capacity  under the revolving credit facility 
the amended nexstar credit agreement also revised the interest rate provisions 
as amended  borrowings under the facility may bear interest at either i a eurodollar rate  which has been amended to include an interest rate floor equal to or ii a base rate  which  as amended  is defined as the greater of the sum of of plus the federal funds rate  bank of america  na s prime rate and the sum of x plus y the eurodollar rate 
the definition of applicable margin was changed to eliminate the pricing grid and replace it with a fixed rate 
as amended  the applicable margin for eurodollar loans is a rate per annum equal to and the applicable margin for base rate loans is a rate per annum equal to 
on october   mission also amended its credit facility and made changes to its credit agreement that generally mirror the changes made to the nexstar credit agreement 
the amended nexstar credit agreement expanded certain cross default provisions such that the breach of certain warranties  representations or covenants under the amended mission credit agreement now constitute an event of default under the amended nexstar credit agreement 
in conjunction with the amendment to our credit agreement and the related collateralization of company owned real estate  million related to professional and legal fees were recognized as administrative expense as incurred 
additionally  nexstar and mission paid million in bank fees related to the debt amendment  which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 
on march   we closed an offer to exchange  of the senior subordinated notes due in exchange for  senior subordinated pik notes due the pik notes 
based on the financial covenants in the senior secured credit facility  the pik notes are not included in the debt amount used to calculate the total leverage ratio until january we believe the consummation of the debt amendment will allow us to maintain compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior secured facility and the indentures governing our publicly held notes for a period of at least the next twelve months from december  cash expenditures for digital television dtv conversion on june  all full power television broadcasters were required to cease operating in an analog format and operate exclusively in digital dtv format 
as of december   all of nexstar s and mission s stations have completed the transition to digital operations  however  nexstar is working with the fcc with respect to kmid s authorization 
dtv conversion expenditures were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and no off balance sheet arrangements at december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our arrangements with mission are on balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

as discussed in note  income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted interpretive guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of january  at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the corporation has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
the resolution of these tax positions may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  bad debts  broadcast rights  trade and barter  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
for an overview of our significant accounting policies  we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions  and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management 
consolidation of mission and variable interest entities our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of independently owned mission and certain other entities when it has been determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
under us gaap  a company must consolidate an entity when it has a controlling financial interest resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity s voting rights 
accounting rules expand the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights 
in applying accounting and disclosure requirements  we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entity s economic risks or receiving a majority of the entity s economic rewards 
our evaluation of the risks and rewards model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change 
mission is included in our consolidated financial statements because we believe we have a controlling financial interest in mission as a result of local service agreements we have with each of mission s stations  our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility and purchase options which expire on various dates between and granted by mission s sole shareholder which will permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
we expect these option agreements to be renewed upon expiration 
in addition  generally in connection with acquisitions  the company enters into time brokerage agreements tba and begins programming and selling advertising for a station before receiving fcc consent to the transfer of the station s ownership and broadcast license 
we include a station programmed under a tba in our consolidated financial statements because we believe that we have a controlling financial interest in the station as a result of the company assuming the credit risk of advertising revenue it sells on the station  its obligation to pay for substantially all the station s reasonable operating expenses  as required under the tba agreement  and in connection with our entry into a purchase agreement  that the sale of the station and transfer of the station s broadcast license will occur within a reasonable period of time 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets approximately million  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include fcc licenses  goodwill and network affiliation agreements 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
as required by authoritative guidance  we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario 
also as required by authoritative guidance  we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the market reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because we view  manage and evaluate our stations on a market basis 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the reporting unit and the prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the reporting unit s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess but not more than the carrying value of goodwill 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company tests network affiliation agreements whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
an impairment in the carrying amount of a network affiliation agreement is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the operations to which the asset relates is less than its carrying value 
we tested our network affiliation  fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment as of september   between the required annual tests  because we believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts and that our fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements might be impaired 
these events included the overall economic recession and the continued decline in advertising revenues at some of our television stations 
we recorded an impairment charge of million as a result of that test which included an impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses of million  related to of our television stations and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to four reporting units consisting of five of our television stations 
we completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill and fcc licenses as of december  which resulted in no additional impairment charge 
the company has four reporting units with a carrying value of goodwill in the amount of million that could be potentially at risk for impairment 
our annual test for impairment indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units by 
we tested our network affiliation  fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment as of september   between the required annual tests  because we believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts and that our fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements might be impaired 
these events included the decline in overall economic conditions and the resulting decline in advertising revenues at some of our television stations 
we recorded an impairment charge of million as a result of that test which included an impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses of million  related to of our television stations  an impairment to the carrying value of network affiliation agreements of million  related to of our television stations  and an impairment to the carrying values of goodwill of million  related to reporting units consisting of of our television stations 
we performed our annual test for impairment at december  and due to the continued decline in overall economic conditions during the fourth quarter of and the further decline in our forecasts for advertising revenues at some stations  the company recorded an additional million in impairment charges  for an annual total of million 
of the additional million impairment charges  million was for fcc licenses  related to of our television stations  million was for network affiliation agreements related to television stations  and million was for goodwill  related to reporting units consisting of of our television stations 
further deterioration in the advertising marketplaces in which nexstar and mission operate could lead to further impairment and reduction of the carrying value of the company s goodwill and intangible assets  including fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
if such a condition were to occur  the resulting non cash charge could have a material adverse effect on nexstar and mission s financial position and results of operations 
the tables below illustrate how assumptions used in the fair value calculations varied from period to period in and the increase in the discount rate between third and fourth quarter reflects the volatility of stock prices of public companies within the media sector along with the increase in the corporate borrowing rate 
the changes in the market growth rates and operating profit margins reflect the general economic pressures impacting both the national and a number of local economies  and specifically  national and local advertising expenditures in the markets where our stations operate 
the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 
we based the valuation of fcc licenses on the following basic assumptions september  december  september  market growth rates to to to operating profit margins to to to discount rate tax rate to to to capitalization rate to to to we based the valuation of network affiliation agreements on the following basic assumptions september  december  september  market growth rates to to to operating profit margins to to to discount rate tax rate to to to capitalization rate to to to we based the valuation of goodwill on the following basic assumptions september  december  september  market growth rates to to to operating profit margins to to to discount rate tax rate to to to capitalization rate to to to the assumptions utilized for our annual impairment assessment for fcc licenses and goodwill as of december  were consistent with those utilized at september  allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both december  and broadcast rights carrying amount broadcast rights are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
cash broadcast rights are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program distributors for the limited right to broadcast the distributors programming 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at our estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the programming received 
the fair value of the advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical rates for specific time periods 
amortization of broadcast rights is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or programming usage  whichever period yields the shorter life 
the current portion of broadcast rights represents those rights available for broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year 
when projected future net revenue associated with a program is less than the current carrying amount of the program broadcast rights  for example  due to poor ratings  we write down the unamortized cost of the broadcast rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenue 
if the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled we would be required to write off the remaining value of the related broadcast rights to operations on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately 
as of december   the amounts of current broadcast rights and non current broadcast rights were million and million  respectively 
trade and barter transactions we trade certain advertising time for various goods and services 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
we barter advertising time for certain program material 
these transactions  except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming  are recorded at management s estimate of the fair value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the fair value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods 
we recorded barter revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trade revenue of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred trade and barter expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is applied against net deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
on january   we adopted interpretive guidance related to income taxes  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for interest and penalties relating to income taxes we recognize these items as components of income tax expense 
stock option expense recognition effective january   we adopted authoritative guidance related to share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
we recognize the expense related to our stock options over the period that the employee is required to provide services  and only to the extent the awards vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate assumption to adjust compensation cost for the effect of those employees that are not expected to complete the requisite service period and will forfeit nonvested options 
we base the forfeiture rate assumption on nexstar s historical experience of award forfeitures  and as necessary  adjusted for certain events that are not expected to recur during the expected term of the option 
we determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
our valuation of employee stock options relies on assumptions of factors we are required to input into the black scholes model 
these assumptions are highly subjective and involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
the option pricing model requires us to input factors for expected stock price volatility and the expected term until exercise of the option award 
due to our limited history of publicly traded shares  we combine our historical stock price data and volatilities of peer companies in the television broadcasting industry when determining expected volatility 
based on a lack of historical option exercise experience  we use the weighted average of the holding periods for all options granted to determine the expected term assumption 
utilizing historical exercise and post vesting cancellation experience of nexstar s stock option awards  the expected term is the average interval between the grant and exercise or post vesting cancellation dates 
claims and loss contingencies in the normal course of business  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for these matters when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated 
we consider a combination of factors when estimating probable losses  including judgments about potential actions by counterparties 
nonmonetary asset exchanges in connection with a spectrum allocation exchange ordered by the fcc within the ghz band  sprint nextel corporation nextel is required to replace certain existing analog equipment with comparable digital equipment 
the company has agreed to accept the substitute equipment that nextel will provide and in turn must relinquish its existing equipment to nextel 
neither party will have any continuing involvement in the equipment transferred following the exchange 
we account for this arrangement as an exchange of assets in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair market value of the equipment received 
we derive our estimate of fair market value from the most recent prices paid to manufacturers and vendors for the specific equipment we acquire 
as equipment is exchanged  the company records a gain to the extent that the fair market value of the equipment received exceeds the carrying amount of the equipment relinquished 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification 
the codification is the official single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap

in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of vie s 
this amendment requires an analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendment requires an ongoing reassessment and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary 
this amendment is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this amendment on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets

it did  however  result in additional disclosures related to the fair value of our debt 
in april  the fasb issued guidance for estimating fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  we adopted this guidance in the second quarter of  and it did not have any effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued guidance related to the determination of the useful life of intangible assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
all term loan borrowings at december  under the senior credit facilities bear interest at  which represented the base rate  or libor  plus the applicable margin  as defined 
revolving loan borrowings at december  under nexstar s senior credit facility bear interest at and  which represented the base rate  or libor  plus the applicable margin  as defined 
all revolving loan borrowings at december  under mission s senior credit facility bear interest at  which represented the base rate  or libor  plus the applicable margin  as defined 
interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements 
the following table estimates the changes to cash flow from operations as of december  if interest rates were to fluctuate by or basis points  or bps where basis points represents one percentage point  for a twelve month period interest rate decrease interest rate increase bps bps bps bps in thousands in thousands senior credit facilities our notes  pik notes  senior subordinated pik notes and notes are fixed rate debt obligations and therefore do not result in a change in our cash flow from operations 
as of december   we have no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on this fixed rate debt 
the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million less than its carrying value 
fair values are determined from quoted market prices where available or based on estimates made by investment banking firms 
given the interest rates that were in effect at december   as of that date  we estimated that our cash flows from operations would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  for a bps and bps interest rate decrease  and decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  for a bps and bps interest rate increase 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million less than its carrying value 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not affected by moderate changes in the inflation rate
