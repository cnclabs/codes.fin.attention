item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this discussion is to summarize the financial condition and results of operations of parkvale financial corporation pfc and provide other information which is not readily apparent from the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
reference should be made to those statements  the notes thereto and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for a complete understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
introduction pfc is a unitary savings and loan holding company incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
its main operating subsidiary is parkvale savings bank the bank  which is a pennsylvania chartered permanent reserve fund stock savings bank headquartered in monroeville  pennsylvania 
pfc and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as parkvale 
parkvale is also involved in lending in the columbus  ohio area through its wholly owned subsidiary  parkvale mortgage corporation pmc 
the bank general the bank conducts business in the greater tri state area through full service offices using the trade name parkvale bank with offices in allegheny  beaver  butler  fayette  washington and westmoreland counties of pennsylvania  two branches in west virginia and five branches in ohio 
with total assets of billion at june   parkvale was the tenth largest financial institution headquartered in the pittsburgh metropolitan area and twelfth largest financial institution with a significant presence in western pennsylvania 
the primary business of parkvale consists of attracting deposits from the general public in the communities that it serves and investing such deposits  together with other funds  in residential real estate loans  consumer loans  commercial loans  and investment securities 
parkvale focuses on providing a wide range of consumer and commercial services to individuals  partnerships and corporations in the greater pittsburgh metropolitan area  which comprises its primary market area 
in addition to the loans described above  these services include various types of deposit and checking accounts  including commercial checking accounts and automated teller machines atms as part of the star network 
parkvale derives its income primarily from interest charged on loans  interest on investments  and  to a lesser extent  service charges and fees 
parkvale s principal expenses are interest on deposits and borrowings and operating expenses 
lending activities are funded principally by deposits  loan repayments  and operating earnings 
lower housing demand in parkvale s primary lending areas  relative to its deposit growth  has spurred the bank to purchase residential mortgage loans from other financial institutions in the secondary market 
this purchase strategy also achieves geographic asset diversification 
parkvale purchases adjustable rate residential mortgage loans subject to its normal underwriting standards 
parkvale purchased million of fixed mortgage loans during fiscal and did not purchase loans during fiscal as a result of uncertainties related to the secondary mortgage market 

table of contents financial condition parkvale s average interest earning assets increased million or for the year ended june  over fiscal year average balances decreased by million in loans  while average federal funds sold increased million and average investments increased by million during the fiscal period 
average deposit liabilities rose million in fiscal year  and average borrowings increased by million in fiscal  resulting in a million decline in net interest earning assets 
in addition  our average interest rate spread declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decreases in net interest earning assets and in the average interest rate spread resulted in a million or decrease in net interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal asset and liability management parkvale functions as a financial intermediary  and as such  its financial condition should be examined in terms of its ability to manage interest rate risk irr and diversify credit risk 
parkvale s asset and liability management alm is driven by the ability to manage the exposure of current and future earnings and capital to fluctuating interest rates 
this exposure occurs because the present value of future cash flows  and in many cases the cash flows themselves  change when interest rates change 
one of parkvale s alm goals is to minimize this exposure 
irr is measured and analyzed using static interest rate sensitivity gap indicators  net interest income simulations and net present value sensitivity measures 
these combined methods enable parkvale s management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of potential changes in the pricing relationship between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis provides one indicator of potential interest rate risk by comparing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing at similar intervals 
the gap ratio is defined as rate sensitive assets minus rate sensitive liabilities for a given time period divided by total assets 
parkvale continually monitors gap ratios  and within the irr framework and in conjunction with net interest income simulations  implements actions to reduce exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
such actions have included maintaining high liquidity  increasing the repricing frequency of the loan portfolio  purchasing adjustable rate investment securities and lengthening the overall maturities of interest bearing liabilities 
management believes these ongoing actions minimize parkvale s vulnerability to fluctuations in interest rates 
the one year gap ratio increased from at june  to as of june   the three year gap ratio went from at june  to at june  and the five year gap ratio was at june  versus at june  the increase in the asset sensitivity in the one year gap ratio is due to an increase in federal funds sold  investments and arm loans scheduled to reprice or mature within one year and projected calls on agency step up securities 
gap indicators of irr are not necessarily consistent with irr simulation estimates 
parkvale utilizes net interest income simulation estimates under various assumed interest rate environments to more fully capture the details of irr 
assumptions included in the simulation process include measurement over a probable range of potential interest rate changes  prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  other imbedded options  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and management s capital requirements 
the estimated impact on projected net interest income in fiscal assuming an immediate parallel and instantaneous shift in current interest rates  would result in the following percentage changes over fiscal net interest income basis points bp   bp   bp   bp  
this compares to projected net interest income for fiscal made at june  of bp   bp   bp   bp  
the fluctuation in projected net interest income between fiscal and relates to lower yields on shorter term liquid assets and is reflective of parkvale s investment and interest rate risk management strategy of shortening the duration of its investment portfolio by purchasing short term agency callable and multi step securities in anticipation of rising interest rates 

table of contents interest sensitivity analysis 
the following table reflects the maturity and repricing characteristics of parkvale s assets and liabilities at june  dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets months months years years total arm and other variable rate loans fixed rate loans  net variable rate mortgage backed securities and cmo s fixed rate mortgage backed securities and cmo s investments and federal funds sold equities  primarily fhlb total interest sensitive assets ratio of interest sensitive assets to total assets interest sensitive liabilities passbook deposits and club accounts checking accounts money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances and other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities ratio of interest sensitive liabilities to total liabilities and equity ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities periodic gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets includes total repayments and prepayments at an assumed rate of per annum for fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  with the amounts for other loans based on the estimated remaining loan maturity by loan type 
based on historical data  assumes passbook deposits are rate sensitive at the rate of per annum  compared with for fiscal includes investment checking accounts  which are assumed to be immediately rate sensitive  with remaining interest bearing checking accounts assumed to be rate sensitive at in the first year and per annum thereafter 
noninterest checking accounts are considered core deposits and are included in the years category 
asset management 
a primary goal of parkvale s asset management is to maintain a high level of liquid assets 
parkvale defines the following as liquid assets cash  federal funds sold  certain corporate debt maturing in less than one year  us government and agency obligations maturing in less than one year and short term bank deposits 
the average daily liquidity was for the quarter ended june  during fiscal  in addition to maintaining high liquidity  parkvale s investment strategy was to purchase primarily lower risk investment grade securities rated aa or higher to enhance yields and reduce the risk associated with rate volatility 
parkvale s lending strategy has been designed to shorten the average maturity of its assets and increase the rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio 
in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of mortgage 
table of contents loans originated or purchased were adjustable rate loans 
parkvale has continually emphasized the origination and purchase of arm loans 
arms totaled million or of total mortgage loans at june  versus million or of total mortgage loans at june  to supplement local mortgage originations  parkvale purchased loans aggregating million in fiscal from mortgage bankers and other financial institutions 
there were no loan purchases during fiscal the loan packages purchased were fixed rate residential loans 
all of the fiscal purchases were residential loans 
the loans purchased from others are reviewed for underwriting standards that include appraisals  creditworthiness and acceptable ratios of loan to value and debt to income calculated at fully indexed rates 
the practice of purchasing loans or arm securities in the secondary market was temporarily discontinued in fiscal due to the lack of acceptable product availability 
at june   parkvale had commitments to originate mortgage loans totaling million and commercial loans of million 
commitments to fund construction loans in process at june  were million  which were funded from current liquidity 
parkvale continues to focus on its consumer loan portfolio through new originations 
home equity lines of credit are granted up to of collateral value at competitive rates 
in general  these loans have shorter maturities and greater interest rate sensitivity and margins than residential real estate loans 
at june  and  consumer loans were million and million  which represented a decrease and a increase over the balances at june  and  respectively  with fixed rate second mortgage loans totaling million  million and million of the total outstanding balances at june   and  respectively 
investments in mortgage backed securities and other securities  such as us government and agency obligations and corporate debt  are primarily purchased to enhance parkvale s liquidity position and to diversify asset concentration 
during fiscal  parkvale purchased an aggregate of million of investment securities classified as held to maturity  compared to million of such purchases in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal purchases consist of government and agency securities  with the exception of million of taxable municipal securities 
substantially all of the purchases were either adjustable or expected to be shorter term due to step up features 
at june   the combined weighted average yield on adjustable corporate securities  agency and collateralized mortgage obligations was 
if the interest rate indices were to fall further  net interest income may decrease if the yield  after discount amortization  on these securities  as well as other liquid assets and arm loans were to fall faster than liabilities would reprice 
all debt securities  with the exception of million of non agency cmos  are classified as held to maturity and are not available for sale or held for trading 
the credit quality of non agency cmo securities rated below investment grade at june  as a result of downgrades by the national rating agencies was evaluated 
based upon recent and future credit deterioration projections and results of the evaluation  the bank intends to sell fifteen non agency cmo securities in the near term 
the debt securities were reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale at june   and other than temporary impairment charges of million were recognized in earnings during fiscal as the difference between the respective investment s amortized cost basis and fair value at june  the remaining carrying value of the available for sale non agency cmo securities is million at june  of the million  all but three securities aggregating million have been sold subsequent to june  it is projected that the level of adversely classified investment securities will decrease by over compared to march  upon the sale of the respective non agency cmo securities along with the non cash other than temporary impairment charges recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the non agency cmo and pooled trust preferred securities 
liability management 
deposits are priced according to management s asset liability objectives  alternate funding sources and competitive factors 
certificates of deposits maturing after one year as a percent of total deposits were at june  and at june  the increased percentage of longer term certificates is reflective of consumer preference for longer terms 
over the past years  parkvale has made a concentrated effort to increase low cost deposits by attracting new checking customers to our community branch offices 
during fiscal  checking accounts increased by compared to a increase during fiscal parkvale s primary sources of funds are deposits received through its branch network and advances from the federal 
table of contents home loan bank fhlb 
fhlb advances can be used on a short term basis for liquidity purposes or on a long term basis to support lending activities 
contractual obligations information concerning our future contractual obligations by payment due dates at june  is summarized as follows 
contractual obligations for deposit accounts do not include accrued interest 
payments for deposits other than time  which consist of non interest bearing deposits and money market  now and savings accounts  are based on our historical experience  judgment and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
due one year years years years total dollars in thousands deposits other than time time deposits advances from fhlb term debt other debt mortgage loan commitments operating leases total concentration of credit risk financial institutions  such as parkvale  generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility of loss is known as credit risk 
credit risk is increased when lending and investing activities concentrate a financial institution s earning assets in a way that exposes the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of related occurrences 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include  but not be limited to  geographic concentrations  loans or investments of a single type  multiple loans to a single borrower  loans made to a single type of industry and loans of an imprudent size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
for loans originated  parkvale has taken steps to reduce exposure to credit risk by emphasizing lower risk single family mortgage loans  which comprise of the gross loan portfolio as of june  the next largest component of the loan portfolio is consumer loans at  which generally consists of lower balance second mortgages and home equity loans originated in the greater pittsburgh area and ohio valley region and an auto loan portfolio 

table of contents nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate reo consisted of the following at june dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans mortgage consumer commercial total nonaccrual loans total foreclosed real estate  net total amount of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate total nonaccrual loans as a of total loans total nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate as a percent of total assets a weak national economy and to a lesser extent local housing sector and credit markets have contributed towards an increased level of non performing assets 
nonperforming delinquent days or more and impaired loans and real estate owned in the aggregate represented  and of total assets at june   and respectively 
such non performing assets at june  have increased to million from million at june   which includes million of non accrual loans 
as of june   single family mortgage loans delinquent days or more include loans aggregating million purchased from others and serviced by national service providers with a cost basis ranging from  to  and loans aggregating million in parkvale s retail market area 
management believes that these delinquent single family mortgage loans are adequately collateralized with the exception of loans with a remaining net book value of million  which have the necessary related allowances for losses provided 
loans days or more delinquent are individually evaluated for collateral values in accordance with banking regulations with specific reserves recorded as appropriate 
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans delinquent days or more of million at june  includes a million relationship with a now closed medical facility  a million relationship to an entity for coal extraction and reclamation  and a million commercial office facility 
the relationships are considered to be impaired at june  and the necessary related allowances for losses have been provided 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when  in management s judgment  the probability of collection of principal and interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a result  uncollected interest income is not included in earnings for nonaccrual loans 
the amount of interest income on nonaccrual loans that has not been recognized in interest income was million for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal parkvale provides an allowance for the loss of accrued but uncollected interest on mortgage  consumer and commercial business loans  which are days or more contractually past due 
in addition  loans totaling million were classified as special mention and million were classified as substandard for regulatory purposes at june  the special mention loans consist of million performing single family mortgage loans 
the substandard loans consist of commercial relationships exhibiting signs of weakness  or have been recently modified or refinanced and are being monitored to assess if new payment terms are followed by the borrowers 
these loans  while current or less than days past due  have previously exhibited characteristics which warrant special monitoring 
examples of these concerns include irregular payment histories  questionable collateral values  investment properties having cash flows insufficient to service debt  and other financial inadequacies of the borrower 
these loans are regularly monitored with efforts being directed towards resolving the underlying concerns while continuing with the performing status classification of such loans 

table of contents loans that are to days past due at june  aggregated million  including million of single family loans  compared to million at june  and million at june  foreclosed real estate was million at june  compared to million at june  the real estate owned includes million in single family dwellings 
the single family units include two unrelated foreclosures of seven and four single family units in residential developments with a net book value of million 
foreclosed commercial real estate aggregates million  which includes two facilities used as automobile dealerships with a net book value of million 
the properties are valued at the lower of cost or market less estimated selling and holding costs with reserves established when deemed necessary 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan loss was million at june  and million at june  or and of gross loans at june  and june   respectively 
the level of non accrual loans and foreclosed real estate peaked during the fiscal year to million at september  and was million at june  management determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss after a thorough evaluation of individual nonperforming  delinquent and high dollar loans  economic and business trends  growth and composition of the loan portfolio and historical loss experience  as well as other relevant factors 
the loan portfolio is monitored by management on a regular basis for potential risks to detect potential credit deterioration in the early stages 
management then establishes reserves in the allowance for loan loss based upon evaluation of the inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan loss is adequate to absorb probable loan losses 
the following table sets forth the allowance for loan loss allocation at june dollars in thousands general allowances residential mortgages commercial multi family mortgage consumer loans commercial loans total general specific allowances residential mortgage consumer commercial total specific total allowances for loan losses the general allowance on residential family loans is million or of the residential family loan portfolio at june   on commercial and multi family loans the general allowance is million or of the commercial and multi family loan portfolio  on consumer loans the general allowance is million or of the consumer loan portfolio and on the commercial loan portfolio the general allowance is million or 
results of operations parkvale financial corporation reported a net loss to common shareholders for the fiscal year ended june  of million or per diluted common share  compared to a net loss of million or per diluted common share for the fiscal year ended june  the million increase in the fiscal net loss reflects higher non cash debt security impairment charges of million compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   partially offset by a million increase in the income tax benefit

the fair value of these derivatives  totaling an  loss at june   is reported as a contra account in other liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the derivatives 
ineffectiveness of these swaps  if any  is recognized immediately in earnings 
the change in value of these derivatives was  for fiscal interest rate swap contracts involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counter party or customer owes the corporation  and results in credit risk to the corporation 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is negative  the corporation owes the customer or counterparty and therefore  has no credit risk 
in light of the significant loss incurred during the fiscal year  the board of directors reduced the dividend from the rate of per common share per quarter to per common share per quarter on june  in doing so  the board of directors considered various factors  including the possibility of non performing loans continuing to increase  the possibility of additional impairment charges on investment securities and goodwill  the capital needs of the bank  the corporation s liquidity  and the level of dividends being paid by peer companies 
if additional investment securities become other than temporarily impaired or if the corporation s goodwill is deemed 
table of contents impaired in a future quarter  impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on parkvale s capital and results of operations 
the quarterly dividend rate during fiscal was 
per common share 
shareholders equity decreased million or at june  compared to june  accumulated other comprehensive loss income was million at june  dividends declared per common share in fiscal were million equal to per common share  representing of net loss for the fiscal year ended june  no treasury stock was purchased in fiscal the book value of parkvale s common stock decreased to per share at june  from per share at june   primarily due to the net loss reported in fiscal the bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of pfc 
the bank s primary regulators are the fdic and the pennsylvania department of banking 
the office of thrift supervision retains jurisdiction over parkvale financial corporation due to its status as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the bank continues to maintain a well capitalized status  reporting a tier capital level as of june  compared to tier capital level at june  adequate capitalization allows parkvale to continue building shareholder value through traditionally conservative operations and potentially profitable growth opportunities 
management is not aware of any trends  events  uncertainties or recommendations by any regulatory authority that will have  or that are reasonably likely to have  material adverse effects on parkvale s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
however  if additional provisions for loan losses or write downs of investment securities become material in a weak economy  our net income and capital ratios would be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and judgments parkvale s consolidated financial statements are prepared based upon the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies 
certain policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect parkvale s reported results and financial position in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on parkvale s future financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
for those loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers nonclassified loans and is based on historical charge off experience and expected loss derived from parkvale s internal risk rating process 
other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that parkvale will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to 
table of contents the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  parkvale does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower 
securities held to maturity  available for sale and other than temporarily impaired 
certain debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  including equity securities with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method 
the recent accounting guidance amends the recognition guidance for other than temporary impairments of debt securities and expands the financial statement disclosures for other than temporary impairment losses on debt and equity securities 
the recent guidance replaced the intent and ability indication in current guidance by specifying that a if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and b it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery  the security would not be considered other than temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss 
when an entity does not intend to sell the security  and it is more likely than not the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  it will recognize the credit component of an other than temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income 
for held to maturity debt securities  the amount of an other than temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the noncredit portion of a previous other than temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security 
as a result of this guidance  parkvale s consolidated statement of operations as of june  reflects the full impairment that is  the difference between the security s amortized cost basis and fair value on debt securities that parkvale intends to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
for available for sale and held to maturity debt securities that management has no intent to sell and believes that it more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery  only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized in earnings  while the non credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
for equity securities  when parkvale has decided to sell an impaired available for sale security and the entity does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover before the expected time of sale  the security is deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
parkvale recognizes an impairment loss when the impairment is deemed other than temporary even if a decision to sell has not been made 
foreclosed real estate 
real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the property less cost to sell 
after foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and a valuation allowance is established for declines in the fair value less cost to sell below the property s carrying amount 
revenues  expenses and changes in the valuation allowance are included in the statement of operations 
gains and losses upon disposition are reflected in earnings as realized 
foreclosed real estate at june  included nine commercial properties aggregating million of commercial property and single family properties aggregating goodwill and other intangible assets 
at june   parkvale has million of core deposit intangible assets subject to amortization and million in goodwill  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
parkvale determined the amount of identifiable intangible assets based upon independent core deposit analyses 
goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
parkvale s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business  and the value is dependent upon parkvale s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition from 
table of contents other market participants on a regional basis 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features  and the ease of use of parkvale s services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue  which is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could result in a charge and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as of june  income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for future tax consequences that arise from the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
changes in tax rates are recognized in the financial statements during the period they are enacted 
when a deferred tax asset or liability  or a change thereto  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  deferred tax benefit or expense is recorded for gaap purposes in the income tax benefit expense line of the consolidated statement of operations for purposes of determining the current period s net income 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are net operating losses  allowance for loan and lease losses  deferred loan fees  deferred compensation and unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale 
deferred tax assets are recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition at net realizable value 
an assessment is performed each reporting period to evaluate the amount of deferred tax asset it is more likely than not to realize 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount of taxable income expected in future periods  as tax benefits require taxable income to be realized 
if a valuation allowance is required  the deferred tax asset on the consolidated statement of financial condition is reduced via a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services as measured by the consumer price index
