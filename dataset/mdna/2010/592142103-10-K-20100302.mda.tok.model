item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during and the last four months of  we operated only our psn business  having sold our hmo on august  during and through august   we operated two financial reporting segments  the psn business and the hmo business 
the sale allowed us to focus solely on our core psn business in and to significantly reduce general and administrative costs 
our results are impacted by many factors  but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently negotiate competitive payments from humana 
benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces  including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures  new prescription drugs and therapies  an aging population  lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking  the tort liability system  and government regulation 
we rely on a key statistical performance measure  the medical expense ratio mer  which is computed by taking total medical expenses as a percentage of revenue 
this measure represents a statistic used to measure gross profit 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  including those that are perceived to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require complex and or subjective judgments by management 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies include use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables 
use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables our revenue is primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is paid to us monthly and varies depending on the county  age and severity of illness of the humana participating customer 
we assume the economic risk of funding our customers healthcare services and related administrative costs 
premium revenue is recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive healthcare services 
because we have the obligation to fund medical expenses  we recognize gross revenue and medical expenses associated with the humana agreements in our consolidated financial statements 
we record healthcare premium payments we receive in advance of the service period as unearned premiums 
periodically we receive retroactive adjustments to the premiums paid to us based on the updated health status of our customers known as a medicare risk adjustment or mra score 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores  customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under part d of the medicare program 
in addition  the number of customers for whom we receive capitation fees may be retroactively adjusted due to enrollment changes not yet processed  or not yet reported 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded 
we record any adjustments to revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is available and the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured  or the likelihood of repayment is probable 
medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
we develop our estimated medical claims payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  care provider contract rate changes  medical care consumption and other medical expense trends 
the actuarial process and models develop a range of projected medical claims payable and we record to the amount within the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
the actual liability incurred could differ materially from the amount recorded 
each period we re examine previously established medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the estimate of medical claims payable recorded in prior periods become more exact  we adjust the amount of our liability estimates  and include the changes in such estimates in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our medical expenses payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on claims experience to date and various assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts recorded 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and item a risk factors a failure to estimate incurred but not reported pending adoption of an accounting pronouncement there are no pending accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and other contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payment due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations service agreements employment obligations as of december   our long term debt totaled  including current portion and we had no payment obligations that would constitute capital lease obligations 
we utilized vendors during the year to assist us with the implementation of the emr system as well as other initiatives 
payments under these service contracts for the years subsequent to december  are approximately   and  in the years  and  respectively 
some contracts will automatically renew unless written notice is provided to the vendor within the stated period of time prior to the end of the contract period 
impact of inflation in february of  cms announced that medicare program spending is projected to increase by in cms also projects that the medicare spending growth rate from to will increase by an average of 
the principal projected drivers for this growth include continued cost increasing medical innovation  inflation  continued strong demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic

our customer months  which are the aggregate number of months of healthcare services we have provided to customers during a period of time  increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
our per customer per month pcpm revenue increased from in to in  an increase of 
the increase in pcpm revenue in was reduced by the ipa agreement entered into as a result of the sale of the hmo 
more specifically  while we owned the hmo in  we received of the premium paid by cms for the hmo s customers 
since the sale of the hmo  we receive  pursuant to the ipa agreement  less than of the cms premium paid to humana with respect to customers in the hmo s former counties of operation 
our pcpm medical expense increased  from in to in  an increase of 
our mer increased by one basis point to in as compared to in the reduction in medicare premiums we received under the ipa agreement increased our mer in compared to the sale of the hmo enabled us to reduce our operating expenses 
in  operating expenses decreased to million compared to million in included in operating expenses is million of stay bonuses and termination costs associated with the sale of the hmo 
excluding these bonuses and termination costs  operating costs in which exclude approximately four months of the hmo s operations would have been million  which is million or higher than operating costs for cms has announced that in  the premiums paid to medicare advantage plans will decrease as a result of a decrease in the base rate and a recalibration of risk scores that will decrease the base rate by an additional 
we believe that the impact on us of the foregoing premium reduction and increased costs will be mitigated by  among other things  reduced benefit offerings  increased customer co pays and deductibles and improved risk score compliance by us

risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
customer information the table set forth below provides i the total number of customers to whom we were providing healthcare services through the psn as of december  and and ii the aggregate customer months for the psn in and and the hmo in following the sale of the hmo and contemporaneous execution of the ipa agreement  the psn assumed responsibility for providing medical services to the customer base of the hmo 
customers at december customer months in percentage change in customer months between years psn hmo total the increase in total customer months for as compared to is primarily a result of the net effect of new enrollments and disenrollments caused by deaths  customers moving from the covered areas  customers transferring to another physician practice or customers making other insurance selections 
at february   the psn was providing services to approximately  customers 
this amount will change as customers may enroll and disenroll through march  revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue 
year ended december increase decrease change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the premium revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
approximately million of the increase in the humana related revenue is attributable to the ipa agreement pursuant to which we began providing services to the customers of the hmo following its sale to the humana plan 
the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in our pcpm premium in as compared to and the increase in our customer base 
the average premium we received per customer per month pcpm for was approximately as compared to for this pcpm premium increase is primarily a result of a increase in the base premium in as compared to  comprised of an industry wide increase in the base premium in  as well as a company specific increase in the base premium based upon an increase in the average medicare risk score of our customers 
periodically  we receive retroactive adjustments to the premiums paid to us based on the updated mra scores of our customers 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores  customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under part d of the medicare program 
in addition  the number of customers for whom we receive capitation fees may be retroactively adjusted due to enrollment changes not yet processed or reported 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is available  the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured  or the likelihood of repayment is probable 
at december   we recorded a million receivable representing our estimate of the retroactive mra premium for services provided in that we expect to receive in the summer of in  we received the final mra premium payment for services provided in in the amount of million 
at december   we had recorded a million estimated mra receivable for services provided in the difference of  reduced revenue in the final retroactive mra premium adjustment for services provided in  which was received in  was not materially different than the estimate we recorded at december  we continue to invest resources in people and processes to assure that our customers are assigned the proper risk scores 
these processes include ongoing training of medical staff responsible for coding and routine auditing of patient charts to assure risk coding compliance 
customers with higher risk codes generally require more healthcare resources than those with lower risk codes 
proper coding helps to assure that we receive premiums consistent with the cost of treating these customers 
our efforts related to coding compliance are ongoing and we continue to commit additional resources to this important discipline 
the payment we receive for providing prescription drug benefits the medicare part d payment is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare the estimated prescription drug benefit costs the estimated costs to actual incurred prescription drug benefit costs the actual costs 
to the extent the actual costs exceed the estimated costs by more than the risk corridor  we may receive additional payments 
conversely  to the extent the estimated costs exceed the actual costs by more than the risk corridor  we may be required to refund a portion of the medicare part d payment 
the final settlement for the part d program occurs in the subsequent year 
at december  we recorded a receivable of  the amount we estimate actual costs exceeded the revenue received 
at december   we estimated that we would be required to refund  related to medicare part d payments received and recorded a liability for this amount 
the amount settled at the approximate amount that was estimated 
in  we determined that the final part d settlement payable for prescription drug coverage in was over accrued by approximately million and we increased revenue in by this amount 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing patient care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
medical claims expense includes such costs as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by providers other than the physician practices owned by the psn collectively non affiliated providers 
medical center costs represent the operating costs of the physician practices owned by the psn 
we develop our estimated medical expenses payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial process develops a range of estimated medical expenses payable and we record to the amount in the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
each period  we re examine previously recorded medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as medical expenses recorded in prior periods becomes more exact  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the change in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include a change in medical expense from the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our estimated medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on our claims experience to date and various management assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amount recorded 
medical expense and mer for and are as follows consolidated hmo psn consolidated estimated medical expense for the year  excluding prior period claims development favorable unfavorable prior period medical claims development in current year based on actual claims submitted total reported medical expense for the year medical expense ratio for year medical expense pcpm in the table above  favorable adjustments to amounts we recorded in prior periods for estimated claims payable appear in parentheses while unfavorable adjustments do not appear in parentheses 
favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
the reported mer is impacted by both revenue and expense 
periodically we receive retroactive adjustments to the premiums paid to us based on the updated mra score 
retroactive adjustments of prior period s premiums that are recorded in the current period impact the mer of that period 
if the retroactive adjustment increases premium revenue then the impact reduces the mer for the period 
conversely  if the retroactive adjustment reduces revenue  then the mer for the period is higher 
these retroactive adjustments include  among other things  the mid year and annual mra premium adjustments and settlement of part d program premiums 
in addition  actual medical claims expense usually develops differently than estimated during the period 
therefore  the reported mer shown in the above table will likely change as additional claim development occurs 
favorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods developing lower than the original estimated cost which reduces the reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
unfavorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods exceeding the original estimated cost which increases total reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million would have impacted the mer by in while a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million would have impacted our mer by in because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers 
total medical expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in total medical expense in was primarily due to the increase in the number of customer months and increasing medical costs 
approximately million or of our total medical expenses in are attributable to medical claims expense 
in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims expense 
the balance was the expenses associated with operating our medical centers 
medical expense on a pcpm basis was in as compared to in this increase of is primarily a result of increasing medical costs and utilization during our mer increased by one basis point from in to in prior to the sale of the hmo in august  we received of the premium paid by cms for the hmo s customers 
following the sale of the hmo and under the related ipa agreement  we receive a percentage of the cms premium received by humana for care for these customers through our psn 
our mer in would have been if the hmo had been sold on january  at december   we estimate that claims paid subsequent to december  for services provided prior to that date was not substantially different than the amount that we had estimated and accrued at december  at december   we estimated that claims paid subsequent to december  for services provided prior to that date were million or approximately of total medical expense lower than the estimated medical expenses payable recorded at december  at december   we determined that the range for estimated medical claims payable was between million and million and we recorded a liability of million  the actuarial mid point of the range 
based on historical results  we believe that the actuarial mid point of the range continues to be the best estimate within the range of the psn s ultimate liability 
medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s employed health professionals and staff providing primary care services  as well as the costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in approximately million of the increase in medical center costs is attributable to payroll costs   is related to a medical center that was acquired in july and  is related to increased medical supply costs

the decrease is primarily a result of a million decrease in payroll cost associated with the hmo following the sale of the hmo primarily offset by the costs related to the amount expensed under the amended employment agreement of our ceo 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
general and administrative costs associated with the hmo decreased million as a result of the sale of the hmo partially offset by increased costs of the psn associated with the number of customers cared for under the ipa agreement 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense primarily consists of advertising expenses and  in  brokerage commissions paid to independent sales agents of the hmo 
marketing and advertising expense was  in as compared to million in  a decrease of 
the primary reason for this decrease is the elimination of these costs upon the sale of the hmo as a significant portion of our marketing costs were incurred during the open enrollment period  which occurred in the first and last quarter of the year 
stay bonuses and termination costs in connection with the sale of the hmo  we paid certain employees of the hmo stay bonuses and termination payments 
we recognized and paid all of these costs  totaling million  in the third quarter of we incurred no such costs in gain on sale of hmo subsidiary on august   we completed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of our hmo to the humana plan for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the hmo in the third quarter of of approximately million 
the gain on sale in of million includes additional gain from the closing net equity settlement for the hmo and the settlement of certain liabilities of the hmo that we settled in at amounts lower than the liability recorded at the time of the sale 
other income we realized other income of  in compared to  in we realized investment income in of  as compared to  in income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in was a result of an increase in our investment in tax exempt securities 
comparison of and summary income before income taxes for was million compared to million in income before income taxes in includes a gain on the sale of the hmo of million and stay bonus and terminations costs associated with the sale of million 
the psn reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for  compared to million for  a decrease of million or

customers at december customer months in percentage change in customer months between years psn hmo total the increase in total customer months for as compared to is primarily a result of the following growth in the number of hmo customers  resulting primarily from the enrollment of new customers during the enrollment period that commenced november  and ended march   the assumption by our psn  on december   of the management of five south florida physician practices not previously affiliated with the psn  which included approximately  humana medicare advantage customers  hmo enrollments during a special enrollment period that occurred in the summer of for customers of a competing medicare advantage plan that had its contract terminated by cms in july  and the net effect of new enrollments and disenrollments  deaths  customers moving from the covered areas  customers transferring to another physician practice or customers making other insurance selections  the increase was partially offset by a reduction of approximately customers in south florida from a psn practice that we closed in august  all of which were moved to other providers outside of the psn

year ended december increase decrease change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the premium revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
approximately million of the increase in the humana related revenue is attributable to the ipa agreement pursuant to which we began providing services to the customers of the hmo following its sale to the humana plan 
the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the psn s pcpm premium in as compared to this pcpm premium increase is primarily a result of an increase in the base premium in and an additional premium as a result of an increase in the average medicare risk score of our customers 
at december   we recorded a million receivable representing our estimate of the retroactive mra premium for that we expected to receive in the summer of the final and retroactive mra premium adjustments  which were received in and  respectively  were not materially different than the estimates we had recorded for those years 
at december   we estimated that we may be required to refund approximately  related to medicare part d payments received and recorded a liability for this amount 
based upon cms final determination of the actual costs of the psn for providing prescription drug benefits in and  we recorded additional revenue in the third quarter of both and of approximately million  representing the amount by which our and year end estimated part d refund liability exceeded the final amount 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing patient care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes

because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers 
during  the psn s medical claims expense increased by approximately million or  primarily as a result of the psn s provision of services to the hmo s customers under the ipa agreement and higher medical costs associated with our psn customers increasing medical needs as reflected in the higher average risk scores of our customers in for the psn  a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million impacts the psn s mer by in and a change of approximately million impacts the psn s mer by in because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers

in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims expense 
the balance was the expenses associated with operating our medical centers 
medical expense on a pcpm basis was in as compared to in this increase of is primarily a result of increasing medical costs and utilization during the mer for the psn increased to in as compared to in during the period subsequent to the sale of the hmo  we did not realize an immediate reduction in medical costs for services provided under the ipa agreement 
this negatively impacted our gross profit and our mer for the period subsequent to the sale since  under the ipa agreement  we receive a percentage of the cms premium received by humana instead of the entire amount we were receiving when operating the hmo 
as a result  we realized less revenue in the last four months following the sale of the hmo than we would have if we had continued to operate the hmo 
the combination of these factors increased our mer in by 
medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s employed health professionals and staff providing primary care services  as well as the costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in the mer for the hmo declined to in from in this decline is primarily a result of our ability to renegotiate certain contracts with hospitals and outpatient service providers in  which reduced the amount we paid for services  improvements in our medical management techniques  and higher premiums from cms attributable to an increase in the base rate and increased risk scores 
total medical expense for the hmo in decreased by million over that incurred in primarily due to the fact that the hmo was sold effective august  and  accordingly  the results of operations for include only eight months of total medical expense 
the estimated medical expense payable for the psn at december  was determined to be between million and million and  as is our policy  we recorded a liability of million  which approximates the actuarial mid point of the range 
at december   our estimated medical expenses payable for the psn was million

the primary reason for this decrease is the elimination of these costs upon the sale of the hmo  as a significant portion of our marketing costs were incurred during the open enrollment period  which occurs in the last quarter of the year 
stay bonuses and termination costs in connection with the sale of the hmo  we paid the employees of the hmo stay bonuses and termination payments 
we recognized and paid all of these costs  totaling million  in the third quarter of restructuring expense in july  we implemented a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the restructuring plan  completed by the end of august  resulted in the closure of two of the hmo s office locations  one psn medical practice  and a workforce reduction involving employees 
in connection with this plan  we recorded approximately  of restructuring costs during the third quarter of  including approximately  for severance payments  approximately  for continuing lease obligations on closed locations and approximately  for the write off of certain leasehold improvements and equipment 
at the time of its closure on july   the psn medical practice served approximately customers in south florida  all of which were moved to other providers outside of the psn 
prior to its closing on july  this psn medical practice generated approximately million of revenue in and had a negative gross margin 
of the  restructuring charge  approximately  related to the hmo with the balance of  associated with the psn 
gain on sale of hmo subsidiary in  we recognized a gain on the sale of the hmo of approximately million 
other income we realized other income of  in compared to million in although we did realize positive investment income in  investment income did decrease by million compared to this was a result of a significant decline in interest rates and realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio of approximately  during income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in the higher effective income tax rate in is a result of adjusting deferred tax estimates related to the hmo 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  totaled approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  this reduction is primarily a result of posting million of short term investments to secure a million line of credit  and classifying this collateral as a non current asset at december   and the repurchase of shares discussed below 
as of december   we had a working capital surplus of approximately million as compared to a working capital surplus of approximately million as of december   a decrease of approximately million or 
this decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the posting of the collateral under the letter of credit agreement discussed above and our repurchase of million of our common stock in  both of which were partially offset by cash flow from operations 
we have an investment policy with respect to the investment of our cash and equivalents 
the goal of the investment policy is to obtain the highest yield possible while investing only in highly rated instruments or investments with nominal risk of loss of principal 
the investment policy sets forth a list of permitted investments and provides that any exceptions to the policy must be approved by the chief financial officer or the chief executive officer 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest our funds in highly liquid securities 
in december  we entered into a one year commercial line of credit agreement with a bank  which provides for borrowings and issuance of letters of credit of up to million 
the line of credit is secured by investments of million 
under this line of credit  as of december   we had a million letter of credit issued in favor of humana 
at december   we had  of debt related to the acquisition of a physician practice 
in october  we announced authorization for the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
on august   the board of directors approved a million share increase to the share repurchase program 
on february   the board approved an increase to the share repurchase program of an additional million shares  bringing the total number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under the program to million shares 
in  we repurchased million shares and options exercisable to purchase  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million 
in  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate of million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we diversify our cash  cash equivalents and investments among counterparties and investment positions to minimize exposure to any one of these entities or investments 
as of december   other than one of our investment positions which represented of our total investment portfolio  none of our other investment positions represented more than of our total investment portfolio 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while maximizing yield on those funds 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including us treasury securities  municipal bonds and corporate debt 
as of december   the fair value of our investment positions was approximately million  over of which had a term to maturity of less than two years and a credit rating by a major rating agency of a or higher 
our investments are classified as trading securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the value of our investments and or our income from investments may decrease in the future 
intangible asset risk we have intangible assets and perform goodwill impairment tests apart from the required annual impairment test of goodwill whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
we evaluate the continuing value of goodwill by using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings  revenue and ebitda ie  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  particularly with regard to entities similar to us that have recently been acquired 
we also consider the market value of our own stock and those of companies similar to ours 
as of december  we believe our intangible assets  including goodwill are recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
