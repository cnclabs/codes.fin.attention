item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition status of our mts and bft contracts  we were notified by the us army that we were not selected as the vendor or program manager for the bft program 
as a result  we experienced a significant and sustained decline in our stock price and we determined that it was appropriate to conduct an interim impairment test for all three of our business segments 
based on our interim impairment analysis  we determined that all of our mobile data communication segment s goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for the fiscal year ended july  we also concluded that the goodwill for our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifiers segments were not impaired 
unless there are other indicators of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in our future financial performance  our next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the first quarter of fiscal any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
provision for warranty obligations 
we provide warranty coverage for most of our products  including products under long term contracts  for a period of at least one year from the date of shipment 
we record a liability for estimated warranty expense based on historical claims  product failure rates and other factors 
costs associated with some of our warranties that are provided under long term contracts are incorporated into our estimates of total contract costs 
there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating warranty expenses  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
as such  if we do not accurately estimate our warranty costs  any changes to our origi nal estimates could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for income taxes is based on domestic including federal and state and international statutory income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions where we operate  permanent differences between financial reporting and tax reporting and available credits and incentives 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
the us f ederal government is our most significant income tax jurisdiction 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions 
we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained 
we recognize all or a portion of the benefit of income tax positions only when we have made a determination that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  based upon the technical merits and other factors 
for tax positions that are determined as more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the development of reserves for income tax positions requires consideration of timin g and judgments about tax issues and potential outcomes  and is a subjective critical estimate 
in certain circumstances  the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
other factors may also influence our provision  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such cos ts in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charge could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we seek to obtain insurance for certain domestic and international customers 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
in light of ongoing tight credit market conditions  we continue to see requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms 
because of our strong cash position and the nominal amount of interest we are earning on our cash and cash equivalents  we have  on a limited basis  approved certain customer requests 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio and have not had any significant negative customer credit experiences to date 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  especially in light of the current global economic conditions and much tighter credit environment 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our consolidated net sales fiscal years ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization of acquired in process research and development amortization of intangibles impairment of goodwill operating income interest expense income  net income before provision for income taxes net income business outlook for fiscal our consolidated net sales of million in fiscal significantly benefited from the timing of shipments and deliveries of multiple large us army mts orders that we received in fiscal these large orders included a million order for third party produced ruggedized mts computers  the single largest order that we received in our history 
sales relating to these large mts orders in fiscal will be significantly lower than the amount we recorded in fiscal although sales in all of our other product lines are expected to grow as compared to the amounts we achieved in fiscal however  as a result of the aforementioned lower mts shipments  we expect that consolidated net sales in fiscal will be significantly lower than net sal es in fiscal as a result of cost reductions and other items as further discussed below  we expect that our consolidated operating income in fiscal will be comparable to the level we achieved in fiscal as of july   we have approximately million in backlog of which million relates to our mts and bft contracts 
a significant portion of our backlog is expected to ship in fiscal our revenue outlook by business segment for fiscal is as follows telecommunications transmission segment we currently expect annual sales in our telecommunications transmission segment in fiscal to increase from the level we achieved in fiscal this sales increase is expected to be driven by increased sales of our over the horizon products  including sales related to our million contract awarded to us in march to provide system design and telecommunications transmission equipment for use in a communications network for our north african country end customer  and our expectation that overall business conditions are slowly improving 
bookings  sales and profitability in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including the strength of our satellite earth station product line bookings and the timing and related recei pt of  and performance on  large contracts from the us government and international customers for our over the horizon microwave systems 
mobile data communications segment although our ability to forecast specific customer fielding schedules  amounts and timing of future orders and product mix requirements remains almost unpredictable  we currently expect sales in our mobile data communications segment to significantly decline from the levels we achieved in fiscal as noted above  we expect that sales to the mts program in fiscal will decline significantly because we delivered  in fiscal  a significant portion of the large orders that we received in fiscal additionally  based on orders currently in our backlog and anticipated satellite service revenues  we expect that our bft sales in fiscal will be slightly higher than fiscal sales 
bookings  sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government as well as risks associated with the uncertainty of the prevailing political and economic environments 
rf microwave amplifiers segment we currently expect fiscal sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment to be slightly higher than the level of sales we achieved in fiscal if we receive large orders related to our amplifiers or switches in support of the crew  crew or crew programs  revenues in fiscal could be higher than our current expectations 
bookings  sales and profitability in our rf microwave amplifiers segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including the receipt of and performance on large contracts from the us government and international customers 
excluding the impact of any potential acquisitions that we may make in fiscal  below is a summary of our aggregated business outlook on certain income statement line items our gross profit  as a percentage of our expected fiscal net sales  is expected to increase from the percentage we achieved in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to changes in product mix 
in fiscal  a significant portion of our sales were for new mts ruggedized computers and mts systems that included new mts ruggedized computers 
these mts computers are manufactured by a third party supplier and have significantly lower gross margins than prior mts computers and negatively impacted the gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal although we expect to ship the remaining computers from these orders during fiscal  the number of computers expected to ship is substantially lower than the actual number of computers shipped in fiscal thus  our gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal is expect ed to increase 
gross margins in any particular future period will be highly influenced by the ultimate quantity of these mts ruggedized computers shipped in those periods 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of expected fiscal net sales  are expected to be higher than fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a decline in consolidated net sales that we expect to experience in fiscal research and development expenses  as a percentage of expected fiscal net sales  are expected to be higher than fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a decline in consolidated net sales that we expect to experience in fiscal the dollar amount of research and development expenses is expected to remain comparable to the amount we spent in fiscal total amortization of stock based compensation which is allocated to cost of sales  selling  general and administrative and research and development expense line items in our consolidated statement of operations  for fiscal  is expected to be lower than the amount we expensed in fiscal amortization of intangibles for fiscal is currently expected to be slightly lower than fiscal and is anticipated to approximate million 
our operating income in fiscal will be positively impacted by a termination fee of million net of certain directly related expenses related to a termination and release agreement dated september   by which we and cpi international  inc terminated a previously announced merger agreement dated may  including this amount  our consolidated operating income in fiscal is expected to be comparable to the level we achieved in fiscal interest income in fiscal is expected to be higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal all of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in commercial and government money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  short term us treasury obligations and bank deposits  and currently yield a blended annual interest rate below 
a portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents is expected to be utilized to pay quarterly dividends and allow us to execute a stock repurchase program that our board of directors authorized on september  interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with our revolving credit line which was increased in august from million to million 
our fiscal estimated effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal will depend on various factors including  but not limited to  future tax legislation enacted  the actual geographic composition of our revenue and pre tax income  the finalization of our irs audits  future acquisitions  and any future non deductible expenses 
we continue to operate our business in a challenging global economic environment and a period of us government budget constraints 
our business outlook is dependent on business conditions continuing to slowly improve 
in addition  although we remain confident in the long term demand drivers for our businesses  it remains difficult for us to forecast whether  to what extent and when  business conditions will meaningfully improve 
if business conditions do not improve as currently anticipated or our current or prospective customers materially postpone  reduce or even forgo purchases of our products and services to a greater extent than we currently anticipate  our business outlook will be adversely affected 
as of july   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we have announced stock repurchase and quarterly dividend programs and plan to continue to grow and diversify our business by making one or more acquisitions 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the year over year increase in net sales is attributable to significantly higher net sales in our mobile data communications segment that were offset  in part  by a decrease in sales in both our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifiers segments 
telecommunications transmission net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decline in net sales in this segment was due to lower sales of our satellite earth station products offset  in part  by a slight increase in sales of our over the horizon microwave systems 
sales in this segment for fiscal also included approximately million of sales related to video encoder and decoder products and fiberglass antennas sold to commercial broadcast customers 
in july  as part of a cost reduction effort  we decided to no longer offer our customers these products 
sales of our satellite earth station products for fiscal were lower than they were in fiscal due to difficult economic conditions 
overall global economic conditions remain challenging  however  we expect a slight improvement in sales in this product line in fiscal based on our expectation that overall business conditions will continue to slowly improve 
sales of our over the horizon microwave systems for fiscal were modest  however  they were slightly higher than they were in fiscal in march  we received a million contract award to provide system design and telecommunications transmission equipment for use in a communications network for our north african country end customer 
as a result of this and other contracts in our backlog  we expect revenue in this product line to grow in fiscal bookings  sales and profitability in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including the book and ship nature associated with our satellite earth station products  the current adverse conditions in the global economy and credit markets  and the timing of  and our related performance on  contracts from the us government and international customers for our over the horizon microwave systems 
mobile data communications net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal through july   we received million in total orders under our existing million mts contract and million in total orders under our existing million bft contract 
sales to the us army pursuant to our existing mts contract during fiscal were approximately million which was substantially higher than the amount we recorded in fiscal sales in significantly benefited from the shipment and delivery of a significant portion of multiple large mts orders that we received in fiscal from the us army  including a million order  the single largest order that we received in our history 
we expect to complete deliveries of these orders in fiscal because a significant portion of these large mts orders shipped in fiscal and because we currently do not expect to receive future mts orders of similar size and scale of the orders we received in fiscal  sales in our mobile data communica tions segment in fiscal will be significantly lower than the level we achieved in fiscal our existing mts contract currently expires january   however  deliveries and performance may be authorized through january the us army also retains the option to extend the contract through july and may also allow for deliveries and performance through july sales to the us army pursuant to our existing bft contract during fiscal were million which was substantially lower than in fiscal primarily due to significantly lower sales of bft mobile satellite transceivers 
bft sales in fiscal primarily reflect satellite transponder capacity and related network and engineering services 
based on orders currently in our backlog and anticipated satellite service revenues  we expect that sales to the bft program in fiscal will be slightly higher than the level that we achieved in fiscal as further discussed above under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  status of our mts and bft contracts  in july  we were advised by the us army that we were not selected as the vendor for the next generation bft program known as bft as a result  the ultimate amount and timing of bft orders and revenues in any future fiscal year will likely depend  in large part  on the speed of the transition to the bft network and future us army operational needs 
sales relating to the design and manufacture of microsatellites  although nominal in both periods  were lower during fiscal as compared to fiscal we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in sales and orders in our mobile data communications segment 
bookings  sales and profitability can fluctuate dramatically from year to year due to many factors  including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
as such  year to year comparisons of our results may not be indicative of a trend or future performance 
our mts and bft contracts are both idiq contracts and  as such  the us army is not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under these contracts 
in addition  a substantial majority of our mobile data communications segment backlog as of july  includes orders relating to new mts ruggedized computers and certain related accessories which are manufactured by a third par ty supplier 
if we do not receive these mts ruggedized computers and certain related accessories in a timely manner or if field deployment schedules change  we could experience further delays in fulfilling funded and anticipated orders from our customers 
rf microwave amplifiers net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decline in our rf microwave amplifiers segment sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to significantly lower sales to the us government  primarily lower crew related sales as well as lower sales attributable to the difficult economic conditions which negatively impacted this segment in the first half of fiscal we currently expect fiscal sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment to be comparable to the level of sales we achieved in fiscal if we receive large orders related to our amplifiers or switches in support of the crew  crew or crew programs  revenues in fiscal could be modestly higher than fiscal bookings  sales and profitability in our rf microwave amplifiers segment can fluctuate drmatically from period to period due to many factors including the current adverse conditions in the global economy and credit markets  and the timing of  and our related performance on  contracts from the us government and international customers 
geography and customer type sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors of the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in mobile data communications segment sales as a percentage of total consolidated net sales 
our mobile data communications segment generally has lower gross margins than our other two business segments 
in addition  our gross profit as a percentage of sales was impacted by the overall change in product mix  as further discussed below 
our telecommunications transmission segment s gross profit percentage for fiscal was slightly lower than the gross profit percentage for fiscal the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of a less favorable product mix and lower overall usage of our high volume technology manufacturing center  located in tempe  arizona  that was driven by a decline in satellite earth station product sales and lower production of mobile satellite transceivers and certain related accessories 
our telecommunications transmission segment manufactures mobile satellite transceivers and certain accessories for our mobile data communications segment  which  in turn  sells them to its customers  primarily the us army 
this decline was partia lly offset by the benefit of cost reduction actions 
our mobile data communications segment experienced a significant decline in gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a change in product mix 
during fiscal  a significant portion of our mobile data communications segment s sales related to the shipment of orders that were in our backlog for new mts third party produced ruggedized computers and related accessories or new mts systems which include these computers 
these new mts computers are manufactured by a third party and have significantly lower gross margins than the mix of mts and bft equipment and services sold during fiscal during fiscal  we also recorded a write down of approximately million of older generation mts computers that we had in our inventories 
the amount of this write down is inclu ded in our provision for excess and obsolete inventory which is further discussed below 
significant period to period fluctuations in our gross margins can occur in our mobile data communications segment as a result of the nature  timing and mix of actual deliveries which are primarily driven by the us army s requirements 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment experienced a higher gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal for fiscal  gross margins in this segment were negatively impacted by long production times relating to certain complex solid state  high power amplifiers and high power switches that employed newer technology 
these amplifiers  which related to orders received in prior years  were shipped in full during fiscal included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
included in cost of sales for fiscal is amortization of million related to the estimated fair value step up of radyne inventory acquired 
as discussed in our item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  is primarily attributable to the higher consolidated net sales for fiscal during fiscal  we benefited from certain cost reduction activities including our fiscal decision to no longer offer video encoder and decoder products or market fiberglass antennas to our broadcast customers 
these cost reductions were offset  in part  by million of professional fees that we incurred in connection with our may  merger agreement with cpi international inc cpi 
in september  after the end of our fiscal  we entered into a termination and release agreement with cpi and we received a fee of million net of certain directly related expenses 
this net amount will benefit our operating income in fiscal amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal amortization of stock based compensation for fiscal includes million related to the estimated fair value of an increase in the contractual terms of previously granted stock based awards 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  research and development expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  is attributable to the higher consolidated net sales for fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable to reductions in spending  including reductions in internal funding for research and development efforts associated with our next generation mts and bft products 
for fiscal and  research and development expenses of million and million  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment  million and million  respectively  related to our mobile data communications segment  million and million  respectively  related to our rf microwave amplifiers segment  with the remaining expenses related to the amortization of stock based compensation expense which is not allocated to our three operating segments 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as research and development expenses was million including million related to the estimated fair value of an increase in the contractual terms of previously granted stock based awards and million for fiscal and  respectively 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of acquired in process research and development 
there was no amortization of acquired in process research and development projects for fiscal during fiscal  in connection with our august  acquisition of radyne  we immediately amortized million for the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development projects 
the acquired in process research and development projects were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
of the million of amortization of acquired in process research and development for fiscal  million related to our rf microwave amplifiers segment and million related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
such amounts are included in each respective segment s operating income results 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
in fiscal and as further discussed above in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations status of our mts and bft contracts  and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in our mobi le data communications segment 
there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
operating income during fiscal includes a million expense for goodwill impairment 
operating income during fiscal reflects a million charge for acquired in process research and development projects associated with our radyne acquisition 
as further discussed below  the increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in operating income in our mobile data communications segment  partially offset by a decrease in operating income in both our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifiers segments 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily due to this segment s decline in net sales and gross margins which were partially offset by cost reduction activities  as discussed above 
operating income for fiscal includes the impact of million of immediate amortization of acquired in process research and development projects associated with our radyne acquisition 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to this segment s significantly higher net sales and lower research and development expenses  offset in part by the aforementioned million expense for goodwill impairment 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment generated operating income of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily due to this segment s decline in net sales and  to a lesser extent  an increase in research and development expenditures  as discussed above 
operating income for fiscal includes amortization of million of acquired in process research and development projects associated with our radyne acquisition 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal primarily due to professional fees of approximately million associated with our terminated merger and acquisition agreement with cpi 
the increase was offset  in part  by lower amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation expense  which is included in unallocated operating expenses  amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of million of our convertible senior notes 
our interest expense during fiscal reflects implied interest expense at related to our convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes were fully converted into common shares during the third quarter of our fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million is primarily attributable to a decline in year over year interest rates offset  in part  by an increase in cash and cash equivalents which generated incremental interest income 
all of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in commercial and government money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  short term us treasury obligations and bank deposits  and currently yield a blended annual interest rate of approximately 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects lower income taxes due to the increase in implied interest expense related to our convertible senior notes 
our effective tax rates for both fiscal and were significantly impacted by the fact that we recorded certain expenses which were non deductible for income tax purposes 
for fiscal  approximately million of the million expense for the impairment of goodwill was non deductible for income tax purposes 
for fiscal  the amortization expense of million for acquired in process research and development was non deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and also reflect net discrete tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the discrete tax benefits in fiscal primarily relate to the passage of legislation that included the retroactive extension of the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit from december  to december  excluding all of the aforementioned items in both periods  our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit on december  for the past several years  the internal revenue service irs has conducted audits of our federal income tax returns 
we believe the areas of their focus have been on the allowable amount of federal research and experimentation credits that we utilized as well as the amount of our domestic production activities deduction 
during fiscal and in prior years  we have reached agreements with the irs for fiscal  and which did not result in any material change to our income tax provisions 
the irs continues to audit our federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended july  and began  in fiscal  to audit our federal income tax return for the year ended july  the irs is not currently examining any of the federal income tax returns filed by radyne corporation for the tax years prior to our august  acquisition of radyne 
although adjustments relating to the audits and related settlements of our fiscal  and tax returns were immaterial  a resulting tax assessment or settlement for fiscal  fiscal  or other later periods could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the year over year increase in net sales is primarily attributable to our acquisition of radyne which significantly benefited both our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifiers segments 
as further discussed below  these increases were partially offset by a significant decline in shipments by our mobile data communications segment to the us army  pursuant to their request 
telecommunications transmission net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  an increase of million  or 
net sales in this segment reflect increased sales of our satellite earth station products  which were partially offset by lower sales of our over the horizon microwave systems 
sales of our over the horizon microwave systems were lower due to significantly lower direct sales to the us department of defense dod and lower indirect sales to algeria  our north african end customer 
sales of our satellite earth station products increased primarily due to incremental sales attributable to the radyne acquisition and incremental sales of our legacy branded satellite eart h station modems which incorporate doubletalk carrier in carrier technology 
although historically nominal in the aggregate  sales of our smaller legacy product offerings embedded within our satellite earth station product line eg  voice gateways and data compression chips and our over the horizon microwave system product lines eg  fiberglass antennas declined as compared to fiscal sales of our video encoder and decoder products were significantly lower than expected as our commercial broadcasting customers experienced very difficult business conditions in their end markets 
in august  we announced that we sold our video encoder and decoder product line and ceased the marketing of fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
aggregate sales of these products were approximately million in fiscal our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal mobile data communications net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
sales for fiscal include incremental sales relating to the design and manufacture of microsatellites and from mobile tracking products that incorporate sens technology which we acquired as part of our acquisition of radyne 
the year over year decline in mobile data communications segment sales is primarily attributable to lower sales of mobile satellite transceivers and related systems to the us army pursuant to both our mts and bft contracts  which  as further discussed below  is primarily attributable to timing imposed by the customer 
in january  we received a million purchase order from the us army for new mts third party produced ruggedized computers and related accessories 
this order is the single largest order received in our history 
in addition  in april  we received an order for million for the supply of mts systems which include both mobile satellite transceivers and mts third party ruggedized computers 
except for some nominal deliveries we made late in fiscal  the us army has requested these orders be delivered during fiscal sales to the mts program in fiscal were also impacted by the absence of mts sales for the army national guard that were specifically funded  in our fiscal  by a supplemental defense appropriations bill commonly referred to as the leahy bond amendment 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal rf microwave amplifiers net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a result of the radyne acquisition  we more than doubled our sales for fiscal in addition  net sales were higher due to increased sales of our legacy solid state  high power broadband amplifiers and high power switches that are incorporated into defense related systems  primarily sales associated with our participation in the counter remote control improvised explosive device electronic warfare crew program 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal geography and customer type sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors of the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in consolidated net sales  discussed above  at significantly lower gross margins 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal is primarily attributable to lower sales and lower production of mobile satellite transceivers which resulted in declines in gross profit percentages in both our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments 
as discussed further below  this was partially offset by an increase in gross profit percentage in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
our telecommunications transmission segment experienced a significant decline in gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline is primarily attributable to a less favorable product mix including an overall decline in production of mobile satellite transceivers at our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona 
the impact of the lower production of mobile satellite transceivers  for our mobile data communications segment  resulted in lower net operating efficiencies primarily due to lower overhead absorption which more than offset the efficiencies we achieved as a result of our successful execution of our radyne related restructuring plan 
our mobile data communications segment experienced a significant decline in gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower sales of mobile satellite transceivers 
significant period to period fluctuations in our gross margins can occur in our mobile data communications segment as a result of the nature  timing and mix of actual deliveries which are driven by the us army s requirements 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment experienced a higher gross profit percentage during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a more favorable product mix as a result of the radyne acquisition 
our rf microwave amplifier product line now includes satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers  which were sold at higher gross margins than those of our legacy product lines 
gross margins for our solid state  high power broadband amplifiers and switches  in fiscal  were negatively impacted by long production times relating of certain complex solid state  high power amplifiers and high power switches that employed newer technology 
these amplifiers were shipped in full during fiscal included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in our item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 
included in the provision for fiscal is a million write down of inventory to net realizable value associated with our decision  in july  to no longer offer video encoder and decoder produ cts or market fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
in addition  included in cost of sales for fiscal is amortization of million related to the estimated fair value step up of radyne inventory acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal include incremental spending associated with sales of radyne s products and services  an increase in professional fees primarily incurred in connection with legal and other matters and ongoing expenses associated with promoting our products and services to the us army 
th is increase was partially offset by lower cash based incentive compensation primarily due to lower consolidated operating income and to a lesser extent  the collection of certain previously written off accounts receivable 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  were and for fiscal and this increase is primarily associated with timing of sales 
although we received record orders from the us army in fiscal  the us army requested that the significant portion of these orders not be delivered until our fiscal despite this delay  we continued our sales and marketing efforts to the us army 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses primarily reflects our continued investment in research and development efforts to develop new products within our legacy product lines as well as incremental investments associated with the expanded product lines that we now offer as a result of the radyne acquisition 
for fiscal and  research and development expenses of million and million  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment  million and million  respectively  related to our mobile data communications segment  million and million  respectively  related to our rf microwave amplifiers segment  with the remaining expenses related to the amortization of stock based compensation expense which is not allocated to our three operating segments 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as research and development expenses was million for both fiscal and as a percentage of consolidated net sales  research and development expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
this increase is primarily associated with timing of sales 
although we received record orders from the us army in fiscal  the us army requested that the significant portion of these orders not be delivered until our fiscal as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of acquired in process research and development 
during fiscal  in connection with the august  acquisition of radyne  we immediately amortized million for the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development projects 
the acquired in process research and development projects were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
of this amount  million related to our rf microwave amplifiers segment and million related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
such amounts are included in each respective segment s operating income results 
there was no amortization of acquired in process research and development projects for fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the significant increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives acquired in connection with the august  acquisition of radyne 
included in amortization of intangibles in fiscal is the acceleration of amortization of million associated with our decision in july to no longer offer video encoder and decoder products 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
as further discussed below  the significant decrease is primarily attributable to operating income declines in both our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments that was partially offset by an increase in operating income in our rf microwave amplifiers segment as well as lower unallocated operating expenses 
operating income during fiscal was negatively impacted by a million charge for acquired in process research and development projects 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal excluding the impact of million of acquired in process research and development expenses  operating income reflects a slight increase that is primarily attributable to increased net sales at lower gross margins 
in addition  operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment was reduced by approximately million including a charge to cost of sales of approximately million and the acceleration of amortization of intangibles of approximately million in connection with our decision in july to no longer offer video encoder and decoder products or market fiberglass antennas to commercial broadcast customers 
our telecommunications transmission segmen t benefited significantly from operating synergies achieved as a result of our radyne acquisition 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating income was primarily due to the significant decline in net sales and gross margins  as discussed further above 
operating income in our mobile data communications segment was also impacted by i incremental investments in our selling and marketing activities primarily associated with promoting our next generation mts and bft products and services  ii incremental investments associated with further developing our microsatellite applications to support anticipated future revenue growth  and iii a slight increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the radyne acquisi tion 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment generated operating income of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal operating income increased significantly due to a higher level of net sales and gross margins achieved  as discussed further above 
operating income in fiscal includes the impact of million of acquired in process research and development expenses 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifiers segment was also impacted by incremental investments in research and development as well as a significant increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the radyne acquisition 
unallocated operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal primarily due to lower payroll related expenses  including cash based incentive compensation and amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation expense  which is included in unallocated operating expenses  amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily attributed to the conversion of our convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock as of february   partially offset by interest expense associated with our may  issuance of our convertible senior notes 
our interest expense for fiscal and reflects implied interest expense at related to our convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes were fully converted into common shares during the third quarter of fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million is primarily attributable to the use of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to purchase radyne and a significant decline in year over year interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal although our effective tax rates for fiscal and were similar  our fiscal effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the fact that we recorded an amortization charge of million for acquired in process research and development  which is non deductible for income tax purposes and which was partially offset by discrete tax benefits of million 
the discrete tax benefits for fiscal primarily relate to the passage of legislation that included the retroactive extension of the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit from december  to december  our effective tax rate for fiscal reflected a net discrete tax cost of million primarily related to our agreement with the internal revenue serv ice irs following their completion of the audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal and fiscal and our estimate of anticipated future disallowable federal research and experimentation credits and interest expense related to our convertible senior notes 
excluding the aforementioned non deductible acquired in process research and development and discrete tax items in both periods  our effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the fact that we were not able to claim federal research and experimentation credits during the full twelve months of fiscal because the related legislation had lapsed on december  
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased to million at july  from million at july   representing an increase of million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was primarily driven by the following net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the net increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in net working capital requirements during fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash used in investing activities for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we spent million to purchase property  plant and equipment  including expenditures relating to ongoing equipment upgrades  as well as enhancements to our high volume technology manufacturing center in tempe  arizona 
during fiscal  we also received proceeds of million from the sale of certain assets and liabilities relating to our video encoder and decoder product line and accrued million of earn out related payments associated with our august acquisition of insite 
for fiscal  million of cash and cash equivalents net of cash acquired was used to purchase radyne 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the issuance  in fiscal  of million of our convertible senior notes and lower proceeds related to stock option exercises 
our investment policy relating to our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents is intended to minimize principal loss while at the same time maximize the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds both government and commercial  certificates of deposit  bank deposits  and us treasury securities 
many of our money market mutual funds invest in direct obligations of the us government  bank securities guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation  certificates of deposits and commercial paper and other securities issued by other companies 
while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  we believe our investment polici es are appropriate in the current environment 
ultimately  the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well functioning liquid market 
as of july   we have million of cash and cash equivalents 
as of july   our material short term cash requirements primarily consist of cash necessary to fund i our ongoing working capital needs  ii anticipated quarterly dividends and iii any actual repurchases of our common stock that we may make pursuant to our million stock repurchase program that has been authorized by our board of directors 
in addition  our current credit facility  which expires on january   requires us to maintain a million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
our material long term cash requirements primarily consist of the possible use of cash to repay our convertible senior notes and operating leases  including the present value of the net contractual non cancelable lease obligations and related costs through october  of million related to radyne s former phoenix  arizona manufacturing and engineering facility  which we have subleased to a third party through october  we have historically met both our short term and long term cash requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operating activities and cash generated from financing transactions 
in light of ongoing tight credit market conditions  we continue to receive requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms 
because of our strong cash position and the nominal amount of interest we are earning on our cash and cash equivalents  we have  on a limited basis  approved certain customer requests 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio and have not had any material negative customer credit experiences to date 
based on our anticipated level of future sales and operating income  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet both our currently anticipated short term and long term operating cash requirements 
although it is difficult in the current economic and credit environment to predict the terms and conditions of financing that may be available in the future  should our short term or long term cash requirements increase beyond our current expectations  we believe that we would have sufficient access to credit from financial institutions and or financing from public and private debt and equity markets 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note c legal proceedings and other matters  we are incurring expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and other matters 
the outcome of these legal proceedings and other matters is inherently difficult to predict and an adverse outcome in one or more matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the period of such determination 
we currently expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million to million 
financing arrangements on may   we issued million of our convertible senior notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
through july   the net proceeds from this transaction were approximately million after deducting the initial purchasers discount and transaction costs paid
