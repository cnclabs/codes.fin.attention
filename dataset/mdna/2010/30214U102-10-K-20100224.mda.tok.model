critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements  product sales in our technology development practice  fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
for time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which in those situations would generally be upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions  aging of amounts due and changes in customer payment terms 
as of january   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables  where certain of those deliverables are non software related 
the new standards permit entities to initially use management s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or when third party 
table of contents evidence is not available 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for annual periods ending after june  and are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  however  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting these new standards on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  including possible early adoption 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we financed our business in fiscal principally through available cash and cash flows from operating activities 
we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short term investments 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at the end of the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a smaller increase in accrued payroll and employee benefits  a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  net of a smaller tax benefit for stock plans  a larger decrease in deferred revenues and a decrease in net income 
accrued payroll and employee benefits increased by  during fiscal as compared to an increase of million during fiscal the smaller increase during fiscal was due to the timing of pay dates in relation to the end of our fiscal year and a decrease in the growth of accrued bonuses 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities  net of the tax benefit for stock plans  decreased by million during fiscal as compared to a decrease of  during fiscal the larger decrease during fiscal was due to the timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in activity in our technology development practice 
during fiscal deferred revenues decreased million as compared to a decrease of  during fiscal the larger decrease was due to fewer pre billed projects 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in net income and a smaller increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenues

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to an increase in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs

as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 

table of contents non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we closely monitor two financial measures  ebitda and ebitdas  which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
we define ebitda as net income before income taxes  interest income  depreciation and amortization 
we define ebitdas as ebitda before stock based compensation 
the company regards ebitda and ebitdas as useful measures of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income  net income and other gaap financial performance measures 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and ebitdas provide meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results 
these measures are used to evaluate our financial results  develop budgets and determine employee compensation 
these measures  however  should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute or superior to  operating income  cash flows  or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of the non gaap measures to the nearest comparable gaap measure is set forth below 
the following table shows ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal years  and fiscal years in thousands  except percentages revenues before reimbursements ebitda ebitda as a of revenues before reimbursements in fiscal  we were able to maintain ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements through our continuing efforts to manage our cost structure by reducing discretionary spending and negotiating favorable agreements with our vendors 
fiscal ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements benefited from the higher level of product sales in our technology development practice in that year 
the increase in ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal was due to a increase in revenues before reimbursements  which was driven by an increase in billable hours and an increase in product sales in our technology development practice 
in fiscal  we expect ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to be consistent with fiscal

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points  the change in the fair value of our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the average effective maturity of our investment portfolio of short term investments and cash equivalents at january  was years 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
