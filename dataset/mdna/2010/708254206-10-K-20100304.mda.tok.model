water supply facilities pennichuck water s principal properties are located in nashua  new hampshire  except for portions of our watershed and buffer land which are located in the neighboring towns of amherst  merrimack and hollis  new hampshire 
in addition  pennichuck water owns four impounding dams which are situated on the nashua and merrimack border 
the primary source of potable water for our core pennichuck water system is the pennichuck brook  holt pond  bowers pond  harris pond and supply pond in the nashua area that together can hold up to million gallons of water 
we supplement that source during the summer months by pumping water from the nearby merrimack river 
this supplemental water supply provides an additional source of water during summer periods and will provide a long term supply for pennichuck water s service area 
a permit from the army corps of engineers that has been extended through december  allows us to divert water from the merrimack river 
we may divert between and mgd dependent upon the river elevation and flow 
as part of our capital expenditures program  we installed three new pumps that increased our pumping capacity to mgd 
we own a water treatment plant in nashua that uses a combination of physical and chemical removal of suspended solids and sand and carbon filtration to treat the water that pennichuck water supplies 
the plant has a rated capacity of mgd 
pennichuck water can deliver up to million gallons per day mgd  into the distribution system 
by comparison  pennichuck water had an average daily demand of mgd during its peak month  which occurred in june our pennichuck water utility subsidiary also owns approximately acres of land located in nashua and merrimack  new hampshire that are held for watershed and reservoir purposes 
this land is separate and apart from the undeveloped land held principally by southwood 
we own water storage reservoirs having a total storage capacity of million gallons  six are located in nashua  two in amherst  and one in each of bedford  derry  litchfield  pelham  barnstead and hollis  new hampshire 
we own a  gallon per day gravel packed well located in amherst  new hampshire 
the sources of supply for pennichuck east consist of purchased water from manchester water works  hooksett village water precinct  the town of derry  the town of raymond  a well system owned by the town of hudson  in litchfield  new hampshire and individual bedrock wells 
pennichuck east has entered into long term water supply agreements to obtain water from manchester water works and hudson 
we have an agreement with the town of hudson  which expires in  that allows us to pump up to  gallons per day or of the annual pumpage from the hudson wells  whichever is least  at a cost equal to the variable cost of production or operation associated with the system as a whole or any of its components and may also include the embedded cost of capital such as debt service or depreciation 
hudson will charge us a higher rate for water pumped in excess of the  gallons allowed per day  as detailed above 
pennichuck east supplies its locke lake and sunrise estates water systems from individual bedrock wells 
the birch hill water system acquires its water from the north conway water precinct 

table of contents pittsfield aqueduct s source of water supply for the town of pittsfield  new hampshire is berry pond  which holds approximately million gallons 
pittsfield aqueduct owns the land surrounding berry pond and it treats the water from this pond through a mgd water filtration plant located in the town of pittsfield  new hampshire 
water distribution facilities as of december   the distribution facilities of our company s regulated water companies consisted of  among other assets  the following pennichuck pennichuck pittsfield water east aqueduct total transmission distribution mains in miles service connections hydrants capital expenditures the water utility industry is capital intensive 
we typically spend significant sums each year for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
during  our capital expenditures will decline relative to prior years because we completed in the upgrade of pennichuck water s nashua water treatment plant which was undertaken to meet the requirements of the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule discussed below 
we estimate that our projected capital expenditures during the through period will total approximately million 
by comparison  for the three year period through  our capital expenditures were million 
these figures are exclusive of allowance for funds used during construction 
regulation new hampshire public utilities commission our company s water utilities are regulated by the nhpuc with respect to their water rates  financings and provision of service 
new hampshire law provides that utilities are entitled to charge rates which permit them to earn a reasonable return on the cost of the property employed in serving their customers  less accrued depreciation  contributed capital and deferred income taxes rate base 
the cost of capital permanently employed by a utility in its regulated business marks the rate of return that it is lawfully entitled to earn on its rate base 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the nhpuc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the nhpuc will approve future rate relief in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 

table of contents in june  pennichuck water filed for rate relief with the nhpuc to recover increased operating expenses and to obtain recovery of and return on capital improvements principally for the ongoing major upgrade to its water treatment plant  the replacement of a million gallon water tank  the installation of radio read meter reading equipment  and the replacement of aging infrastructure 
in december  the nhpuc issued an order approving temporary annualized rate relief of approximately million for pennichuck water effective for service rendered from july  in august  the nhpuc issued a final order approving a permanent rate increase in annualized revenues of approximately million  replacing the prior annualized temporary increase of million 
substantially all of the increase in permanent rates over temporary rates was a million step increase effective the date of the order on august  in december  pennichuck water accrued  related to the temporary rate increase effective for service rendered from july  in august  pennichuck water accrued  related to the final permanent rate order for service rendered from july  in may  pittsfield aqueduct filed for rate relief with the nhpuc to recover increased operating expenses and to obtain recovery of and a return on capital improvements principally benefitting water systems acquired in in december  the nhpuc issued an order approving annualized temporary rate relief of approximately  for pittsfield aqueduct effective for service rendered from june  in december  the nhpuc issued a final order approving a permanent rate increase in annualized revenues of approximately  effective for service rendered from june  and replacing the prior annualized temporary increase of  as part of the final nhpuc rate order  pittsfield aqueduct was allowed to transfer certain of its assets that included systems located in barnstead  middleton and conway  new hampshire to its sister utility  pennichuck east 
water quality regulation our company s water utilities are subject to the water quality regulations issued by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the new hampshire department of environmental services des 
the epa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act 
the quality of our company s water utilities treated water currently meets or exceeds all current standards set by the epa and the des 
pennichuck water s treatment plant in nashua is subject to the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule  which established a turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
pennichuck water completed its evaluation of alternatives to meet the new turbidity standard in  resulting in its recommendations for upgrades to its existing treatment facilities  beginning with its raw water facilities through its finished water pumping and storage facilities 
the upgrades were substantially completed in at a total cost of approximately million 
water management services through service corporation  we complement our regulated water utility business by providing contract operation and maintenance services  including monitoring water quality  testing  maintenance and compliance reporting services for water systems for various towns  businesses and residential communities primarily in southern and central new hampshire 
service corporation is not subject to nhpuc regulation 

table of contents municipalities service corporation has long term agreements with the towns of salisbury  massachusetts and hudson  new hampshire to provide operations and maintenance contract services 
these agreements expire in and  respectively 
contracts with the towns of barnstable  massachusetts and wilton  new hampshire ended as of june  and july   respectively  and were not renewed by the municipalities 
non transient  non community water systems the des has mandated water quality standards for non transient  non community water systems defined as public facilities such as schools  apartment and office buildings accommodating more than persons and served by a community well 
there are an estimated such systems in new hampshire which require the services of a certified water operator  such as service corporation  in order to meet the mandates of the des 
accordingly  service corporation is actively pursuing new contracts under which it would serve as the certified water operator and provide various water related monitoring  maintenance  testing and compliance reporting services for these systems in new hampshire 
competition in marketing its services to municipalities  service corporation must address competition from incumbent service providers and reluctance by municipalities to outsource water management to an investor owned company 
for contracts with non transient  non community water systems  service corporation competes primarily with well drillers  laboratories  pump equipment vendors and small contract operators who provide various services to these systems 
financial information about industry segments our business segment data for the latest three years is presented in note  business segment reporting in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
employees at december   we employed full time employees  all of whom are pennichuck water employees 
of these  there are management and clerical employees who are non union 
the remaining employees are members of the united steelworkers union 
the company s union contract expires in february we believe that our employee relations are good 
ongoing eminent domain proceeding overview the city of nashua the city is engaged in an ongoing effort that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of pennichuck water s assets through an eminent domain proceeding under new hampshire revised statutes annotated chapter  as well as the assets of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
in january  the nhpuc ruled that the city could not use the eminent domain procedure to acquire any of the assets of pennichuck east or pittsfield aqueduct 

table of contents the nhpuc conducted a hearing on the merits of the city s proposed eminent domain taking of the assets of pennichuck water  which hearing was completed on september  on july   the nhpuc issued its order in this matter  ruling that a taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and provided that the city pay to pennichuck water million for such assets determined as of december  the conditions include a requirement that nashua pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
based on advice of counsel  we believe that the nhpuc s order contains a number of significant legal errors that undermine its validity with respect to whether or not such eminent domain taking is in the public interest and regarding the price to be paid by the city for such taking  and whether the assets of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct could be subject to the taking 
we also believe that an outcome based on the july order is not in the best interests of the company s shareholders 
both the company and the city filed motions for rehearing or reconsideration before the nhpuc which were denied in an order dated march  subsequently  both the company and the city filed appeals with the supreme court 
oral arguments before the supreme court occurred on january  and the company expects that the supreme court will likely render its decision in march or april a webcast of the oral argument before the supreme court is currently available at the supreme court s website http www

we cannot predict the outcome of the supreme court appeals or the ultimate outcome of these matters 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company has stated publicly that it remains open to engaging in settlement discussions with the city aimed at resolving this dispute outside of eminent domain and that it remains vehemently opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water s assets 
new hampshire law does not require that our board of directors or shareholders ratify or approve a forced sale of assets by eminent domain or the amount of compensation that pennichuck water would receive if the city ultimately successfully completes its proposed eminent domain taking of the assets of pennichuck water 
nashua s initiation of eminent domain proceedings the company entered into an agreement in april to be acquired by merger with aqua america  inc formerly philadelphia suburban corporation 
the merger was subject to several conditions  including approval by our shareholders and approval by the nhpuc 
in february  before we submitted the merger to our shareholders  we and aqua america agreed to abandon the proposed transaction because of actions taken by the city to acquire our assets by eminent domain 
the city s mayor at that time stated his opposition to our proposed merger with aqua america after we announced it 
in november  the nashua board of aldermen adopted a formal resolution to hold a city wide referendum to approve the initiation of an eminent domain proceeding or other acquisition of all or a portion of pennichuck water s system serving the residents of the city and others 
in january  nashua residents approved the referendum 

table of contents in november  the city made a proposal to purchase all of the company s assets for a purchase price of million 
the offer was subject to various conditions  including the city s completion of a municipal bond offering to fund the purchase price 
the city claimed that its proposal exceeded by million the approximate value that our shareholders would have received under the proposed aqua america merger measured at the time that transaction was first announced 
the city asserted that the difference would offset the corporate level income taxes that the company would incur in a sale of assets to the city 
in december  our board of directors unanimously rejected the city s proposal 
at that time  we publicly stated that our board had concluded that the city s proposal was inadequate and not in the best interests of our shareholders  significantly underestimated the value of our assets and failed to recognize both the underlying value of our shares and the potential tax liabilities that would result from the proposed transaction 
we also stated that we believed that the city s proposal failed to make allowances for assuming our long term debt and other liabilities 
in march  as part of the eminent domain process  the city filed a petition with the nhpuc seeking approval to acquire all of our water utility assets  whether or not related to our nashua service area 
the nhpuc ruled in january that the city could not use the eminent domain procedure to acquire any of the assets of pennichuck east or pittsfield aqueduct  and that  with regard to the assets of pennichuck water  the question of which assets  if any  could be taken by the city was dependent on a determination to be made after a hearing as to what was in the public interest 
uncertainty regarding compensation to pennichuck water as previously stated  on july   the nhpuc issued its order that the taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and provided that the city pays million to pennichuck water for such assets determined as of december  the conditions include a requirement that the city pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
another condition is that the city submit to the nhpuc  for its advance approval  the final operating contracts between the city and its planned contractors 
the remaining conditions cover various aspects of the operation and oversight of the water system under city ownership 
further information regarding the eminent domain order and the supreme court appeal is contained in note  commitments and contingencies contained in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
certain tax considerations if the city acquires for cash in an eminent domain proceeding any of pennichuck water s assets  pennichuck water would be taxed as if it had willingly sold those assets to the city 
unless we are able to utilize a special non recognition income tax provision discussed below  we would recognize gain for federal income tax purposes at the corporate level equal to the excess of the aggregate value pennichuck water receives for each asset minus the adjusted tax basis of those assets 
the aggregate adjusted tax basis of pennichuck water s assets is significantly less than the aggregate adjusted book value of those assets as reflected in our financial statements appearing in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
the difference exists primarily because the rate at which we depreciate pennichuck water assets for federal income tax purposes is greater than the depreciation rate that we use for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  an asset valuation by the nhpuc equal to or greater than adjusted book value would likely require pennichuck water to recognize from such sale a taxable gain and resultant income tax liability that would likely be material in amount 
if  for example  we then distributed the remaining cash proceeds from such sale and from the sale of the company s remaining assets to our shareholders in liquidation of the company  another tax would be triggered at the shareholder level if and to the extent the amount of cash distributed exceeds the shareholder s cost basis in the shares being redeemed 

table of contents it may be possible for pennichuck water to defer the recognition of gain for tax purposes on a forced sale of assets if within a certain time period it reinvests the amount received from the sale in property that is similar or related in service or use to the property acquired by the city 
the rules for replacing real property under these circumstances are less stringent than the rules for replacing personal property 
to the extent that some of the assets subject to sale are determined under state and local law to be personal property and not real property  pennichuck water will be more limited in its options for locating suitable replacement property for these assets and  thus  less likely to defer any potential tax at the corporate level 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that pennichuck water would be successful in deferring the recognition of any or all of the taxable gain by reinvesting the proceeds in like kind property  especially considering the risks associated with finding suitable property proximate to the company s current location and the magnitude of the amounts that would have to be reinvested 
this description of certain tax consequences of an eminent domain taking by the city does not purport to constitute tax advice to any holder of our common stock 
each shareholder is urged to consult his  her or its own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences of an eminent domain taking to the holder  including the application and effect of foreign  state and local income and other tax laws 
city may not proceed with acquisition in an eminent domain scenario  the city would not be bound to proceed with the acquisition until ratified by a vote of two thirds of the nashua board of aldermen 
in addition  we expect that the city would need to incur debt financing to fund the purchase 
consequently  even if the nhpuc order withstands the supreme court appeal  there is no assurance that the city will proceed with the acquisition 
our opposition to a forced sale of assets we have vigorously opposed the city s efforts to force pennichuck water to sell its assets to the city through the eminent domain proceeding  and we intend to continue to do so 
an important distinction between a forced sale of assets through an eminent domain proceeding and a negotiated acquisition of pennichuck assets or stock that might result from a comprehensive settlement is that  in the former circumstance  after we have exhausted our legal challenges to a forced sale of assets in an eminent domain proceeding and to the amount of damages that the city would have to pay to us as a consequence of such a taking  neither our board of directors nor our shareholders would have any right to approve or disapprove the taking 
our eminent domain related expenses have been significant  as disclosed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and could continue to be significant depending on the outcome of the appeals pending before the supreme court and other factors 
town of pittsfield eminent domain actions the town of pittsfield voted at its town meeting to acquire the assets of our pittsfield aqueduct subsidiary by eminent domain 
in april  the town notified us in writing of the town s desire to acquire the assets 
we responded that we did not wish to sell the assets 
thereafter  no further action was taken by the town until march  when the town again voted to take the assets of our pittsfield aqueduct subsidiary and also to appropriate  for the eminent domain process 
on march   we received a letter from the town reiterating the town s desire to acquire the assets of our pittsfield aqueduct subsidiary 
we do not have a basis to evaluate whether the town will actively pursue the acquisition of our pittsfield aqueduct assets by eminent domain  but since the date of the town s letter to us  the town has taken no further legal steps required to pursue eminent domain under new hampshire rsa chapter 
table of contents town of bedford eminent domain actions the town of bedford voted at its town meeting in march to take by eminent domain the company s assets within bedford for purposes of establishing a water utility  and by letter dated april  inquired whether the company  and any relevant wholly owned subsidiary of the company  was then willing to sell said assets to bedford 
the company responded by letter dated june   informing the town that the company does not wish to sell those assets located in bedford that are owned by any of its subsidiaries 
the company has not received a response to its letter  and since the date of the town s letter to us  the town has taken no further legal steps required to pursue eminent domain under new hampshire rsa chapter during the nhpuc hearing regarding the proposed eminent domain taking by nashua  the witness for the town of bedford testified that the town s interest in a possible taking of assets of the company related to a situation in which nashua might acquire less than all of the company s assets  leaving the system in bedford as part of a significantly smaller utility 
item a 
risk factors there are various risks involved in investing in our company  some of which are described below 
investors should carefully consider each of the following factors and all of the other information in this annual report on form k  including information that is incorporated in this annual report on form k by reference 
risks related to our water utilities the city of nashua s attempt to use the power of eminent domain to acquire a significant portion of our water utility assets creates uncertainty and may result in material adverse consequences for us and our shareholders 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are involved in ongoing proceedings with the city of nashua the city or nashua regarding the city s desire to acquire all or a significant portion of the water utility assets of pennichuck water  our principal subsidiary  as well as the assets of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
the city is pursuing such acquisition pursuant to its right to seek the authority to take such assets by eminent domain under new hampshire law 
in january  the nhpuc ruled that the city could not use the eminent domain procedure to acquire any of the assets of pennichuck east or pittsfield aqueduct 
on july   the nhpuc issued an order that the taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and that the amount of compensation to be paid to pennichuck water for such assets is million determined as of december  the conditions included a requirement that nashua pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct from the costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the loss of use of shared assets resulting from the taking of pennichuck water s assets by nashua 

table of contents an eminent domain taking of the assets of pennichuck water pursuant to the july  nhpuc order would result in a significant taxable gain based on the difference between the eminent domain taking price as finally determined and the tax basis of the pennichuck water assets which was approximately million as of december  the resulting corporate level tax liability would substantially reduce the sales proceeds after an eminent domain taking ie  before distribution to our shareholders unless we were able to defer the tax liability by reinvesting all or a substantial portion of the eminent domain proceeds in other water utility assets in accordance with certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
however  we believe it would likely be difficult to find suitable replacement property that would be priced fairly and that otherwise would be prudent for us to purchase 
for these reasons  we do not expect that the reinvestment of all or a substantial portion of the eminent domain proceeds would be a viable strategy for the company to defer the payment of the tax liability due as a result of the sale of assets in an eminent domain taking 
a taking by eminent domain could also result in our company incurring various other costs depending on the final terms of the eminent domain taking and decisions that our company may make regarding its remaining operations 
these costs may include expenditures associated with termination and or funding of health and retirement plans  certain debt redemption premiums  severance costs and professional fees 
in addition  if the company were to sell some or all of its remaining businesses or assets as a consequence of an eminent domain taking  it could be forced to accept prices below their current carrying values as a result of then current market conditions  a limited number of potential buyers  and or other factors 
the company expects that the supreme court will likely render its decision in march or april the company cannot predict the outcome of the supreme court appeals or the ultimate outcome of these matters 
our vigorous opposition to the city s efforts to acquire our assets by eminent domain has had  and may continue to have  a material adverse effect on our operating results and has been  and may continue to be  a significant distraction to our management 
we have vigorously opposed the city s efforts to acquire pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct s assets by eminent domain and we intend to continue to do so 
our eminent domain related expenses have been significant 
total eminent domain expenses were approximately  in   in   in and million in each of and a substantial portion of our senior management s attention has been and will continue to be devoted to coordinating various aspects of our response to the city s eminent domain initiative 
we cannot assure you that management s attention to the city s eminent domain initiative will not adversely affect their oversight of other aspects of our business 
we may not be able to maintain our existing indebtedness or to incur additional indebtedness under our existing long term and revolving debt facilities  if our future credit ratios do not satisfy the requirements under those facilities 
our ability to issue long term debt is subject to us satisfying certain financial ratios at the time of such borrowing ie  debt incurrence tests 
similarly  our ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility is subject to maintaining certain financial ratios ie  maintenance tests 
these ratios limit the amount of long term debt relative to net plant and the amount of total debt to total capitalization and also specify minimum amounts of earnings and cash flow available to pay interest and fixed charges as a percentage of such interest and fixed charge amounts 
we were in compliance with such tests as of december  our ability to incur significant additional long term debt and to continue to satisfy these tests depends  among other factors  on receipt of timely and adequate rate relief 

table of contents should we be unable to issue long term debt  to borrow under our revolving credit facility or otherwise to access traditional sources of funds at reasonable costs and terms  our ability to finance our future capital expenditures program on a timely basis could be materially impaired 
in such event  we might need to seek other forms of capital at less favorable costs and terms or defer or reduce some of our capital expenditures 
any delay in implementing or completing capital improvements could adversely affect our ability to request and receive rate relief from the nhpuc relating to capital expenditures incurred by us and could give rise to contractual penalties 
if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default under these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 
we expect that all or substantially all of our then outstanding indebtedness would be accelerated if the city of nashua were to acquire a significant portion of our assets by eminent domain  such acceleration could adversely affect our financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
an eminent domain taking or temporary use by any governmental body of all or substantially all of the tangible property of pennichuck water used or useful in its business as a water company would result in a mandatory redemption of our long term debt 
we expect that any taking of pennichuck water s assets by the city in the eminent domain matter now on appeal before the new hampshire supreme court or a bona fide sale in lieu of such taking would represent the taking of substantially all of pennichuck water s tangible property used or useful in its business as a water company and would therefore trigger mandatory redemption of our long term debt 
similarly  our revolving credit facility with bank of america provides that any indebtedness outstanding under the facility would be due upon the city acquiring all or a material portion of pennichuck water s assets in an eminent domain proceeding 
also  no new borrowings would be permitted under such facility 
such acceleration could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if we are unable to repay such indebtedness at that time or to refinance the indebtedness on equally favorable terms and conditions or to incur new borrowings 

table of contents we may be restricted by one or more debt agreements from paying dividends in amounts similar to dividends that our company has paid in recent periods  or  in more unlikely circumstances  from continuing to pay any dividend 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or  if dividends are paid  that they will be in amounts similar to dividends that our company has paid in recent periods 
it is our current intention  however  to continue to pay comparable cash dividends in the future  subject to the terms of our company s debt agreements 
certain bond and note agreements as well as our revolving credit facility impose restrictions on the payment or declaration of dividends under certain circumstances 
the loss of a significant commercial or industrial customer could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our revenues will decrease  and such decrease may be material  if one or more significant commercial or industrial customers terminate  or materially reduce  their use of our water 
if any large commercial or industrial customer reduces or ceases its consumption of our water  we may seek nhpuc approval to increase the rates of our remaining customers to recover any lost revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that the nhpuc would approve such a rate relief request  and even if it did approve such a request  it would not apply retroactively to the date of the reduction in consumption 
the delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations that may impose significant limitations and restrictions on the way we do business 
various federal  state and local authorities regulate many aspects of our business 
among the most important of these regulations are those relating to the quality of water we supply our customers 
these laws require us to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations and to perform water quality tests that are monitored by the us environmental protection agency  or epa  and the new hampshire department of environmental services  or des  for the detection of certain chemicals and compounds in our water 
we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators for non compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
in addition  government authorities continually review these regulations  particularly the drinking water quality regulations and may propose new or more restrictive requirements in the future 
if new or more restrictive limitations on permissible levels of substances and contaminants in our water are imposed  we may not be able to adequately predict the costs necessary to meet regulatory standards 
if we are unable to recover the cost of implementing new water treatment procedures in response to more restrictive water quality regulations through the rates we charge our customers  or if we fail to comply with such regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water systems 
any pending or future acquisition we decide to undertake will involve risks 
the acquisition and integration of water systems is an important element in our growth strategy 
this strategy depends on identifying suitable acquisition opportunities and reaching mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to expend significant resources 
further  acquisitions may result in dilution for the owners of our common stock  our incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and fluctuations in quarterly results 
in addition  the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the financial results that we expected 

table of contents the current concentration of our business in southern and central new hampshire makes us susceptible to any adverse development in local regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and weather conditions 
our core service area comprises pennichuck water s franchise in the city of nashua  new hampshire and portions of the surrounding towns of amherst  hollis and merrimack 
pennichuck east serves a similar area in southern and central new hampshire  east of the merrimack river and pennichuck water s core service area 
our revenues and operating results are therefore subject to local regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and weather conditions in these areas 
a change in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
in addition  any such change would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to water utility companies that do not have such a geographic concentration 
weather conditions and overuse may interfere with our sources of water  demand for water services and our ability to supply water to our customers 
we depend primarily on surface water from the pennichuck brook and  to a lesser extent  the merrimack river in nashua  new hampshire to meet the present and future water demands of our customers 
unexpected conditions may interfere with our water supply sources 
drought and overuse may limit the availability of surface water 
these factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
additionally  cool and wet weather  as well as drought restrictions and our customers conservation efforts  may reduce consumption demand  also adversely affecting our revenues and operating results 
furthermore  freezing weather may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage 
if we experience an interruption in our water supply  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
contamination of our water supply may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our water supply is subject to contamination from the migration of naturally occurring substances in groundwater and surface systems  as well as pollution resulting from man made sources 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source through our interconnected transmission and distribution facilities 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods 
our inability to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective or timely manner  may have an adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
the necessity for increased security has and may continue to result in increased operating costs 
in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks and the ensuing attention to threats to the nation s health and security  we have expended resources to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also incurred expenses to tighten our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
we are not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies 
however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of such events should they occur 

table of contents damage to any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition  revenues  operating results and cash flows 
pennichuck water owns seven dams  including four impounding dams which are situated on the nashua and merrimack border 
while we regularly inspect and maintain the dams to comply with existing standards  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and property damage downstream for which we may be liable above our insurance limits and which may adversely affect our financial condition  revenues and operating results 
the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition  revenues  operating results and cash flows 
the success of our business strategies depends significantly on the services of the members of our senior management team and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer 
the success of our business strategies depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our senior management team 
if we lose the services of any member of our senior management or are unable to hire and retain experienced management personnel  it could harm our operating results 
risks related to our water management business our water management subsidiary s revenue growth depends on its ability to enter into new operating contracts and maintain its existing contracts with municipalities  communities and non transient  non community water systems 
in our target market of new hampshire and nearby portions of maine  massachusetts and vermont  municipalities and communities own and operate the majority of water systems 
a significant portion of service corporation s marketing and sales efforts is spent demonstrating the benefits of contract operations to elected officials and municipal authorities 
employee unions and certain public interest groups generally oppose the principle of outsourcing these services to companies like us and are active opponents in this process 
the political environment means that decisions are made based on many factors  not just economic factors 
there can be no assurance that we can maintain or expand our water management business 
our water management subsidiary s business depends on trained  qualified employees 
state regulations set the staff training  experience and staff qualification standards required for service corporation s employees to operate specific water facilities 
we must recruit  retain and develop qualified employees  maintain training programs and support employee advancement 
we must provide the proper management and operational staff of state certified and qualified employees to support the operation of water facilities 
failure to do so could put us at risk for  among other things  operational errors at the facilities  which could have an adverse effect on our water management business 

table of contents our water management subsidiary s business is subject to environmental and water quality risks 
clients of service corporation are owners of the facilities that we operate under contract 
the facilities must be operated in accordance with various federal and state water quality standards 
we also handle certain hazardous materials at these facilities  for example  sodium hydroxide 
any failure of our operation of the facilities  including noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous material leaks and spills  and similar events  could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
other risks there is a limited trading market for our common stock  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global market  the trading in our common stock has substantially less liquidity than many other companies quoted on the nasdaq global market 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
as a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common stock  a sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the open market could cause our stock price to decline 
we are subject to anti takeover measures that may be used by existing management to discourage  delay or prevent changes of control that might benefit non management shareholders 
classified board of directors we have a classified board of directors  which means only one third of our directors are elected each year 
a classified board can make it harder for an acquirer to gain control by voting its candidates onto the board of directors and may also deter merger proposals and tender offers 
at least two annual meetings of shareholders  instead of one  would generally be required to effect a change in a majority of the board 

table of contents authorized shares our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
the shares of common stock and preferred stock were authorized in an amount greater than intended to be issued to provide our board of directors with flexibility to effect  among other transactions  financings  acquisitions  stock dividends  stock splits and employee stock option grants 
however  these additional authorized shares may also be used by the board of directors to deter future attempts to gain control of the company 
the board of directors has sole authority to determine the terms of any one or more series of preferred stock  including voting rights  conversion rates and liquidation preferences 
as a result of the ability to fix voting rights for a series of preferred stock  the board has the power to issue a series of preferred stock that would have the effect of discouraging or blocking a post tender offer merger or other transaction by a third party 
shareholder rights plan our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
any rights under the plan will expire on april  unless previously redeemed or extended 
the rights plan is intended to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire the company s outstanding common stock 
under the terms of the rights plan  a preferred stock purchase right is attached to each share of our common stock that is currently outstanding or becomes outstanding before the rights become exercisable  are redeemed or expire 
the rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired or obtained the right to acquire or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring  beneficial ownership of more than or up to with the prior approval of the board of directors of our outstanding common stock 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the rights will entitle every holder of our common stock  other than the acquirer  to purchase our stock or stock of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer 
our board of directors  however  has the power to amend the rights plan so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable 
we believe these features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on the board taking action to prevent the rights from becoming exercisable 
effective march   the company and its largest shareholder gamco investors  inc gamco  and the other affiliated gabelli group of companies and funds collectively the gabelli group  entered into a letter agreement  pursuant to which gamco and the gabelli group have been granted an exemption to collectively purchase up to  but not equal to  of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  subject to terms set forth in the letter agreement 
supermajority shareholder approval may be required for fundamental transactions with an interested shareholder our articles of incorporation require that certain fundamental transactions must be approved by the holders of two thirds of each class of stock entitled to vote and two thirds of the total number of shares entitled to vote  unless a majority of disinterested directors has approved the transaction and other specified conditions are satisfied  in which case the required shareholder approval will be the minimum approval required by applicable law 
the transactions that are subject to this provision are various fundamental transactions between us and an interested shareholder or an affiliate of that shareholder 
these transactions include certain sales or other dispositions of our assets  certain issuances of our capital stock  certain transactions involving our merger  consolidation  division  reorganization  dissolution  liquidation or winding up or certain amendments of our articles of incorporation or bylaws 
we believe that the interested shareholder provision will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with the board of directors before commencing a tender offer 

table of contents approval by the nhpuc would be required for any acquisition of the company  and the nhpuc would consider factors other than what is in the best interest of our shareholders 
our water utility subsidiaries are regulated by the nhpuc 
the nhpuc takes the position that under new hampshire law  water utility holding companies may not be acquired unless and until there is an order of the nhpuc approving the acquisition 
in practice  companies acquiring water utility holding companies in new hampshire have typically sought nhpuc approval as a condition of any transaction 
the nhpuc may approve an acquisition only if it determines that the acquisition will not have an adverse effect on rates  terms  service or operation of the utilities and is lawful  proper and in the public interest

table of contents item legal proceedings the city of nashua  new hampshire the city is engaged in an ongoing effort that began in to acquire all or a significant portion of the assets of pennichuck water  our largest utility subsidiary  through an eminent domain proceeding under nhrsa chapter  as well as the assets of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
in january  the nhpuc ruled that the city could not use the eminent domain procedure to acquire any of the assets of pennichuck east or pittsfield aqueduct 
on july   the nhpuc issued its order in this matter  ruling that a taking of the assets of pennichuck water is in the public interest provided certain conditions are met  and provided that it pays to pennichuck water million for such assets determined as of december  the conditions include a requirement that nashua pay an additional million into a mitigation fund to protect the interests of the customers of pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct 
another condition is that the city submit to the nhpuc  for its advance approval  the final operating contracts between the city and its planned contractors 
the remaining conditions cover various aspects of the operation and oversight of the water system under city ownership 
both the company and the city filed motions for rehearing or reconsideration before the nhpuc which were denied in an order dated march  subsequently  both the company and the city of nashua appealed the nhpuc order to the new hampshire supreme court 
oral arguments before the supreme court occurred on january  and the company expects that the supreme court will likely render its decision in march or april see part i  item  business for a discussion of the background of the proceeding  various issues and uncertainties associated with the proceeding and the possible outcomes of the proceeding  which discussion is incorporated by reference into this item 
we are opposed to the city s proposed eminent domain taking of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct s assets 
the company has stated publicly  however  that it remains open to engaging in settlement discussions with the city aimed at resolving this dispute outside of eminent domain 
as previously noted in the company s form k filed on december   the city of nashua announced on december  that it had notified its investment bankers and other advisors to cease any current work on behalf of the city in connection with a possible negotiated settlement with the company  and that the city will continue to vigorously pursue its pending supreme court appeal 
in its announcement  the city stated that although it was not foreclosing the possibility of further discussions  it is not prepared to pursue a transaction at a value in excess of the city s view of the company s fair market value under the circumstances 
the city also stated that  in the view of its advisers and based upon publicly available information  the fair market value for the company  including our principal subsidiary pennichuck water  is about per share 
the company has noted that the valuation of pennichuck by the city s advisers is materially less than the valuation of pennichuck water determined by the nhpuc in the eminent domain proceeding 
even if the city ultimately is successful in obtaining a final determination that it can take some or all of the assets of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct by eminent domain  it is not required under nhrsa ch 
to complete the taking and could ultimately choose not to proceed with the purchase of the assets 
the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
it is possible that  if the acquisition efforts of the city are successful  the financial position of the company would be materially impacted

our annual eminent domain related expenses in through were    million and million  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies  significant estimates and judgments we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments reflected in these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows regulatory accounting 
accounting standards codification topic  regulated operations prescribes generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator such as the nhpuc 
accordingly  we defer costs and credits on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits are incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallowed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
we have not deferred costs incurred to defend against the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding against our pennichuck water subsidiary 
revenue recognition 
the revenues of our regulated water utility subsidiaries are based on authorized rates approved by the nhpuc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
we read our customer meters on a monthly basis and record revenues based on those readings 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage and the effective water rates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
our non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made into the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate applied to estimated future payment obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trends 
changes in pension and other postretirement benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs in the consolidated statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plan participants 
in determining pension obligation and expense amounts  the factors and assumptions described above may change from period to period and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and other postretirement benefit costs and funding requirements 
further  the value of our pension plan assets are subject to fluctuations in market returns which may result in increased or decreased pension expense in future periods 
our pension plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of we currently anticipate that we will contribute approximately  to the plan during as compared to  in 
table of contents results of operations general in this section  we discuss our  and results of operations and the factors affecting them 
our operating activities are discussed in greater detail in note  business segment reporting in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
results of operations compared to overview our revenues  and consequently our net income  can be significantly affected by economic and weather conditions as well as customer conservation efforts  and in past years our net income has been significantly affected by sales of major real estate assets which have occurred from time to time 
water revenues are typically at their lowest point during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
water revenues in the second and third quarters tend to be greater because of increased water consumption for non essential usage by our customers during the late spring and summer months 
for the year ended december   our net income was million  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  on a per share basis  the fully diluted income per share for the year ended december  was  compared to fully diluted income per share of for the year ended december  the principal factors that affected current period net income  relative to prior period net income  included the following a non operating  after tax gain of approximately million million before federal income taxes from the sale of three commercial office properties by three of our hecop joint ventures  an increase in regulated water utility operating income of an increase in eminent domain related costs of  a decrease in interest income of  a decrease in allowance for funds used during construction of  and a decrease in the provision for income taxes of million 
regulated water utility operations our regulated water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct  each of which is regulated by the nhpuc 

table of contents our utility operating revenues increased to approximately million in  an increase of million  or  over  as shown in the following table 
year ended december  dollars in thousands change pennichuck water pennichuck east pittsfield aqueduct total the increase in revenues is primarily the result of the full year impact in of temporary rate increases granted to pennichuck water and pittsfield aqueduct in and a partial year effect of the permanent rate increases granted to those subsidiaries in offset  in part  by an approximately million revenue decrease associated with reduced customer usage 
for the year ended december   approximately of our billed water utility usage was to residential customers and approximately to commercial and industrial customers  with the balance being principally from billings to municipalities 
company wide usage for the year ended december  declined by approximately  approximately half of which was the result of energy conservation programs implemented by our largest industrial customer in the third quarter of the revenue impact of these conservation programs was offset in by a make whole provision contained in the customer s contract 
while we believe that the current economic conditions and customer conservation efforts  as well as cool and wet weather patterns in june and july of have been the primary cause of the reduction in consumption among our residential  commercial and industrial customers aside from the effects of the energy conservation programs implemented by the industrial customer discussed above 
we believe revenues will be favorably impacted by the full year impact of the permanent rate increases we received in august and december  as discussed above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we also believe customer usage may be further decreased by additional customer conservation efforts as a result of these rate increases  as well as general customer response to various conservation focused communications and the continuing acceptance of more water efficient appliances 
for the year ended december   utility operating expenses increased by approximately million  or approximately  to approximately million as shown in the table below 
year ended december  in thousands change operations maintenance depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total 
table of contents the operations and maintenance expenses of our regulated water utility business include such categories as water supply  treatment  purification and pumping  transmission and distribution system functions  including repairs and maintenance and meter reading  and engineering  customer service and general and administrative functions 
the million increase in our utilities operating expenses over the same period in was primarily the result of the following increased taxes other than income taxes of  principally related to increased real estate taxes resulting from capital additions in our core pennichuck water system  as well as increased assessed values  increased general and administrative costs of  primarily relating to increased pension and postretirement expense of  increased customer accounting expenses of  primarily associated with the additional costs of billing customers on a monthly rather than a quarterly basis  increased depreciation and amortization of  principally due to increased depreciation attributable to completed portions of the water treatment plant upgrade for pennichuck water  and increased transmission and distribution costs of  relating to repair or replacement of gates  mains  meters  services and hydrants  partially offset by decreased production costs of  related to lower consumption levels and lower power rates 
as a result of the above changes in operating revenue and operating expenses  regulated water utility operating income increased to million from million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  water management services the operating income of our water management services business was  and  for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
service corporation s contracts with two municipalities ended on june  and july   and have not been renewed by the municipalities 
the operating revenue earned from these two contracts was and of service corporation s total revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
eminent domain expenses our eminent domain expenses were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the eminent domain expenses were primarily attributable to on going legal fees in connection with our appeal to the new hampshire supreme court and  to a lesser extent  our retention of an investment banking firm in january we expect to continue to incur material eminent domain expenses in 
table of contents allowance for funds used during construction afudc for the year ended december  and  we recorded afudc of approximately  and  respectively 
the  decrease is attributable to the completion of certain large projects qualifying for afudc during the reported periods 
we do not expect any significant amounts of afudc to be recorded in interest income for the years ended december  and  we recorded interest income of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease of  is primarily attributable to lower balances in our bank and money market accounts throughout  as well as lower earned rates on these balances 
provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million and million  respectively 
the decrease was largely due to federal income taxes on the january gain on the sale of the real estate held by hecop i  ii  and iii joint ventures 
the effective income tax rate was and  respectively 
the state of new hampshire income tax liability on income attributable to our company s four joint ventures is imposed at the llc level  and not at the pennichuck corporation level in contrast to federal income taxes 
therefore  state of new hampshire income taxes for the joint ventures are included in net loss earnings from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the amount of such state income taxes in was approximately  this is the principal reason why the provision for income taxes for  as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes  was lower in than the statutory rate of 
results of operations compared to overview for the year ended december   our consolidated net income was million  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  on a per share basis  fully diluted income per share for was as compared to per share for the principal factors that affected net income  relative to prior year net income  are the following rate relief granted by the nhpuc to all three of our regulated water utilities  record rainfall levels in southern new hampshire during the third quarter of which substantially reduced demand for our company s water  and therefore water utility revenues  during what is typically the highest demand quarter in the year  
table of contents a non operating after tax gain of approximately million million before federal income tax from the sale of land and three commercial office buildings by three of our four hecop joint ventures  a non operating gain of million pre tax from the sale of eight cell tower leases  an increase in regulated water utility operating expenses of approximately million  an increase in interest expense of  a reduction in eminent domain related costs of  costs were net of a  cash payment from the city of nashua  and an increase in the provision for income taxes of  regulated water utility operations our water utility operations include the activities of pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct  each of which is regulated by the nhpuc 
on a combined basis  operating income of our three utilities for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from our water utility operating revenues increased to approximately million in  or from  as shown in the following table 
year ended december  dollars in thousands change pennichuck water pennichuck east pittsfield total water utility operating revenues increased by million due principally to the application of higher water rates granted by the nhpuc to all three of our utilities pennichuck water  pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct to substantially reduced water usage volumes resulting from record rainfall levels in the third quarter of recorded rainfall in the third quarter of  as reported to the national weather service from our nashua water treatment plant  set an all time record of inches compared to the prior record of inches in and the long term average of inches for the same period 
in addition  the record rainfall was spread relatively evenly over each of the three months in the third quarter  further impacting customers summer irrigation and other outdoor usage during that quarter and into the fourth quarter of see part i  item  regulation in this annual report on form k for a discussion of rate matters 

table of contents for the year ended december   approximately of our water utility operating revenues were derived from commercial and industrial customers  approximately from residential customers  with the balance being derived from fire protection and other billings to municipalities  principally the city of nashua and the towns of amherst  merrimack and milford  new hampshire 
for the year ended december   utility operating expenses increased by approximately million  or approximately  to approximately million as shown in the table below 
year ended december  in thousands change operations maintenance depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total the change in our utilities operating expenses over the same period in was primarily the result of the following increased depreciation and amortization expense totaling  and increased property taxes of  principally due to the completed portions of the water treatment plant upgrade for pennichuck water   of increased production costs largely related to increased fuel  power and purification costs   of increased transmission and distribution costs relating to repair or replacement of gates  mains  meters and hydrants  supplies  fuel and labor costs  and  of increased general and administrative costs primarily relating to higher costs for employee benefits and property and casualty insurance  offset in part by a reduction in accrued bonuses resulting from operating performance variations between the comparable periods 
as a result of the above changes in operating revenue and operating expenses  water utility operating income declined by  or to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  water management services the following table provides a breakdown of revenues from our non regulated water service business for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands change municipal contracts base fees under contracts municipal contracts additional to base scope of contracts community system contracts watertight and other total 
table of contents municipal base contract fees increased by  primarily due to annual adjustments to the base fees charged to existing customers as a result of cpi indexed increases provided for in our contracts 
the increase in additional contract work of  was due principally to major projects undertaken for our salisbury  ma customer  additional work performed for customers to repair and restore facilities as a result of a major december ice storm  and an increase in compliance work for some of our small systems customers ie  arsenic removal systems and other treatment improvements 
watertight and other income increased by  principally due to a  increase in contract testing programs 
for the year ended december   total operating expenses associated with our non regulated water service business increased  from maintenance costs for servicing our various operating contracts increased by  the increase in maintenance expense was partially offset by a decrease in the amount of professional  marketing and general and administrative expenses of  and a decrease of  for bad debt expense 
as a result  operating income related to the water service business increased to  for the year ended december  real estate operations as of december  and  the company  principally through its southwood subsidiary  owned approximately acres of non utility undeveloped land in southern new hampshire 
as of december   southwood also held a ownership interest in one real estate joint venture organized as a limited liability company 
as of december   southwood held a ownership interest in four real estate joint ventures organized as limited liability companies 
for the year ended december   southwood s equity share of pre tax earnings from the four real estate joint ventures hecops i  ii iii and iv was approximately million  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in the joint ventures pre tax earnings was due principally to an approximately million gain before federal income tax from the january sale of the three commercial real estate properties owned by three of the four joint ventures 
in december  the three joint ventures that had held these properties hecops i  ii and iii were dissolved 
the real estate assets sold by three of the four joint ventures comprised substantially all of the assets of those three joint ventures 
the fourth joint venture currently owns undeveloped land and generates no revenue 
consequently  earnings or losses from these joint ventures for the foreseeable future are expected to be insignificant 
expenses associated with our real estate operations were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was attributable to a decrease in salaries and benefits of approximately  and a decrease in the intercompany management fee of  in  we determined that our real estate operations conducted through southwood was no longer a reportable business segment as a result of the sale and dissolution of substantially all of southwood s joint ventures and the expectation of limited activity in the foreseeable future 
therefore we have reported financial information relating to our real estate operations under other segments for in note of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents eminent domain expenses  net our eminent domain expenses were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the eminent domain expenses were primarily attributable to reviewing and analyzing the nhpuc s july  eminent domain order and preparing our motion for rehearing filed in august the amount for the year ended december  is net of a  cash payment received from the city of nashua pursuant to an agreement with the city to suspend the eminent domain hearings 
the eminent domain expenses were primarily attributable to expenses incurred in preparing for and conducting the merits hearing  and to a lesser extent  expenses related to settlement discussions 
other expense income  net other expense income  net for the year ended december  was  as compared to million for the year ended december  included in other income in is a gain on the sale of eight cell tower leases in the amount of million 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc for the year ended december  and  we recorded afudc of approximately  and  respectively 
the  decrease is largely attributable to the completion of certain large projects qualifying for afudc during the reported periods 
interest income for the year ended december  and  we recorded interest income of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase of  is primarily attributable to higher balances in our money market accounts throughout the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   our interest expense was approximately million  compared to million in the increase of  is primarily attributable to the issuance of million principal amount tax exempt bonds in october and an additional million of tax exempt bonds in may partially offsetting this increase was the october  redemption of pennichuck water s million series b bonds 
interest expense in both periods primarily represents interest on long term indebtedness of our company s three regulated water utilities 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  and  we recorded an income tax provision of million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to federal income taxes on the gain on the sale of the real estate held by the hecops i  ii  and iii joint ventures 
the effective income tax rate for these periods was and  respectively 
the state of new hampshire income tax liability on income attributable to our company s four joint ventures is imposed at the limited liability company level  and not at the pennichuck corporation level in contrast to federal income taxes 
therefore  state of new hampshire income taxes are reflected under net loss earnings from investments accounted for under the equity method in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the amount of such state taxes is approximately  this is why the provision for income taxes for  as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes  is lower in than it was for 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of funds are cash flow from utility operations  cash proceeds from the commercialization of portions of our non utility real estate holdings  borrowings pursuant to our bank revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities 
our primary uses of funds are capital expenditures associated with our continuous utility construction programs  dividends on our common stock payable as and when declared by our board of directors and repayments of principal on our outstanding debt obligations  whether pursuant to scheduled sinking fund payments or final maturities 
for the past several years  cash flows have fluctuated largely based on four factors i weather  ii amount and timing of rate increases  iii gains recognized on the sale of non utility real estate and cell tower leases  as discussed above  and iv costs associated with the city of nashua s ongoing eminent domain proceeding 
during the period from through  in addition to cash flow from operations  we generated million of proceeds from long term borrowings 
we also generated an aggregate million during the same period through a public offering of common stock  our dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan drcspp and the exercise of stock options 
we borrowed million on march  pursuant to a year amortizing loan at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
we also entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at 
capital expenditures program we expect our capital expenditures to moderate during the period through due to the completion in of our water treatment plant during the first half of the following table summarizes our expected capital expenditure requirements for the to period 
in thousands utility water treatment plant upgrade utility other plant additions total we are engaged in construction programs at our utility subsidiaries primarily for water distribution system repair  rehabilitation and replacement  water storage facility maintenance and additions  and more recently  water supply security 
the timing of these projects may be impacted by weather  availability of contractors and equipment  coordination with other utilities and municipalities in order to reduce digging and paving costs and the availability and cost of financing 

table of contents external financing requirements we repaid million of senior notes due march  with cash on hand and the proceeds of a million year amortizing loan at libor plus 
we also have four loans approved as of december  through the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the state of new hampshire revolving fund srf program 
these four loans  totaling approximately million  were not drawn as of december  we expect to borrow the entire million in we have applied  and will continue to apply  for long term debt funds directly from the srf program 
funds provided under srf loans carry long term fixed interest rates set with reference to various municipal bond indices  which rates are generally below the rates for comparable us treasury securities of like maturity 
as of december   we had eight outstanding srf loans with aggregate principal balances outstanding of approximately million 
funds available for future advances  on these loans  as of december  totaled approximately  the construction associated with these available loans will not be completed until the fall of we expect that the majority of the remainder of our funding requirements will be provided by cash flow from our operations after payment of dividends on common stock but before repayment of current principal due on long term debt  short term borrowings  and to a lesser extent  through the issuance of common stock pursuant to our drcspp 
our timing and mix of future debt and equity financing is subject to a number of factors including  but not limited to  i debt and equity market conditions  ii the need to maintain a balanced capital structure in order to preserve financial flexibility and to manage the overall cost of capital  iii certain debt issuance covenants as contained in our outstanding loan agreements  and iv the impact of the ongoing eminent domain dispute on our ability to raise debt or equity capital and the cost of such capital 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete all or any of the future debt and equity financings described below or to complete them on a timely basis 
the receipt of timely and adequate rate relief will also be critically important in providing us cash flow from operations and the ability to access credit and permanent capital  both debt and equity  at reasonable costs and terms 
we are unable  however  to predict the outcome of our future rate relief filings 

table of contents significant financial covenants our million revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america expires june  this agreement contains three financial maintenance tests which must be met on a quarterly basis 
capitalized terms listed below are used herein as defined in the revolving credit loan agreement 
these maintenance tests are as follows our fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed x  our tangible net worth must exceed million  plus new equity issued subsequent to december  and our funded debt less certain cash and short term investment balances  if any must not exceed of our total capitalization 
also  various pennichuck water and pennichuck east loan agreements contain tests that govern the issuance of additional indebtedness 
capitalized terms listed below are used herein as defined in the revolving credit loan agreement 
these issuance tests are as follows to issue short term debt  the sum of our short term debt and funded debt may not exceed of our short term debt  funded debt and capital and all stock surplus accounts unless the new short term debt is subordinated to existing debt  to issue long term debt  our funded debt generally may not exceed of our net amount of capital proper  and to issue long term debt  our earnings available for interest divided by our interest expense must exceed x 
several of pennichuck water s loan agreements contain a covenant that prevents pennichuck water from declaring dividends if pennichuck water does not maintain a minimum net worth of million 
as of december   pennichuck water s net worth was million 
one of pennichuck east s loan agreements contains a covenant that prevents pennichuck east from declaring dividends if pennichuck east does not maintain a minimum net worth of million 
as of december   pennichuck east s net worth was million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
our ability to incur significant additional long term debt and to continue to satisfy these tests depends  among other factors  on receipt of timely and adequate rate relief 
quarterly dividends one of our primary uses of funds is dividends on our common stock  payable as and when declared by our board of directors 
we have paid dividends on our common stock each year since on january   the board of directors declared a first quarter common stock dividend of per share payable march  to shareholders of record february  the first quarter dividend amount results in an indicated annual rate of per share 
we expect to continue to pay comparable cash dividends in the future  subject to the terms of our debt agreements  as more fully discussed above 
off balance sheet arrangements on august   pennichuck water implemented a legal defeasance transaction for its outstanding  new hampshire industrial development authority series tax exempt bonds series bonds 
pennichuck water placed us treasury securities in an irrevocable escrow account with the bank of new york  the bond trustee  in an aggregate amount sufficient to provide for all remaining scheduled principal and interest payments on the series bonds 
this defeasance transaction discharged all future pennichuck water obligations with respect to the series bonds and pennichuck water no longer records the debt in its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in october  pennichuck water completed a tax exempt debt financing with the new hampshire bond finance authority bfa 
the bfa acts solely as a passive conduit to the tax exempt bond markets with us acting as the obligor for the associated tax exempt debt 
as of december  we had borrowed million of the million offering 
the remaining million was placed in escrow for the sole benefit of bondholders with no recourse to us and hence we have not recorded the associated debt as a long term liability 
as a result of the recent completion of our million water treatment plant upgrade and the generation of approximately million of equity capital  net of expense  in december  we currently do not expect to draw upon these funds when the escrow matures in july we had one interest rate financial instrument  an interest rate swap  which qualified as a derivative  as described in note  debt in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
this interest rate swap expired in accordance with its terms on december  contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due more less than to to than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations estimated interest on long term debt short term borrowings operating lease obligations pension and retiree medical costs total represents debt maturities including current maturities 
pension and retiree medical costs beyond are estimated as they may be impacted by such factors as return on pension assets  changes in the number of plan participants and future salary increases 
in may  pennichuck water renegotiated its long term lease arrangement for approximately  square feet of office space located in merrimack  new hampshire 
this office space serves as pennichuck corporation s headquarters 
the renegotiated lease expires in april  with pennichuck water having the option to terminate the lease on april  without penalty 
pension plan 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our employees 
we use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension funding 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed a long term rate of return on pension plan assets of in  and in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of in  and these key assumptions are reviewed annually and are updated periodically to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions and may impact the amount of funding we contribute to the plan 

table of contents dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan we offer a dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase program 
under this program  our shareholders  employees and customers may reinvest all or a portion of their common stock dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
we also accept optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at of the prevailing market prices 
this program has provided us with additional common equity of  in and  in environmental matters our regulated water utility subsidiaries are subject to the water quality regulations set forth by the environmental protection agency epa and the new hampshire department of environmental services des 
the epa is required to periodically set new maximum contaminant levels for certain chemicals as required by the federal safe drinking water act 
the quality of our treated water currently meets or exceeds all standards set by the epa and the des 
however  increased monitoring and reporting standards have led to additional operating costs for us 
any additional monitoring and testing costs arising from future epa and des mandates should eventually be recovered through water rates in our utilities future rate filings 
pennichuck water s filtration plant in nashua is impacted by the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule rule  which established a new turbidity standard of nephelometric turbidity units or ntu 
turbidity is a measure of sediment or foreign particles that are suspended in the water 
through december   pennichuck water had expended an aggregate million of capital expenditures on upgrades to its water treatment plant in order to comply with the rule 
capital expenditures associated with complying with federal and state water quality standards have historically been recognized and approved by the nhpuc for inclusion in our water rates  though there can be no assurance that the nhpuc will approve future rate increases in a timely or sufficient manner to cover our capital expenditures 
new accounting standards in november  the sec released a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board 
under the proposed roadmap  we may be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs as early as the sec will make a determination in regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
our company is currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our financial statements  and we will continue to monitor the sec s determination regarding of the potential requirement to implement of ifrs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information regarding market risk of our company and our subsidiaries is presented in note  financial measurement and fair value of financial instruments and note  debt in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
as described below  we had one interest rate financial instrument  an interest rate swap  which qualified as a derivative  as described in note  debt in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
that interest rate swap expired in accordance with its terms on december  we are subject to commodity price risks associated with price increases for chemicals  electricity and other commodities 
these risks are reduced through contracts and the ability to recover price increases through rates 
non performance by our commodity suppliers can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
our exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility  which includes a total borrowing capacity of million  permits us to borrow  re pay and re borrow  in varying amounts and from time to time at our discretion through june  we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest rates at prime or libor plus to based on the results of various financial ratios 
the applicable margin as of december  was 
during  we expect to utilize a portion of this facility from time to time to fund our short term cash requirements
