this represents a decrease of from operating income of million in fiscal our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million  or to million at april  compared to million at april  as of april   we held marketable securities  to settle obligations under our executive capital accumulation plan ecap with a cost value of million and a fair value of million 
our working capital decreased million in fiscal to million 
we believe that cash on hand and funds from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements in the next twelve months 
we had no long term debt nor any outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at april  critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions and changes in the estimates are reported in current operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
fee revenue from ltc services is recognized as earned 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual 
table of contents results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are goodwill  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results

in response to the uncertain economic environment and labor markets  we took steps to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels  in an effort to retain positive cash flows 
continued adverse changes in our fee revenue  however  could require us to institute additional cost cutting measures 
to the extent our efforts are insufficient  we may incur negative cash flows  and if such conditions persist over an extended period of time  it might require us to obtain additional financing to meet our capital needs 
we believe that our cash on hand and funds from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements during the next twelve months 
our performance is subject to the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions and industries in which we operate 
the economic activity in those regions and industries have shown improvement in the second half of fiscal but total recovery may be long and gradual

accounting developments recently adopted accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb implemented the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the single source of authoritative gaap 
the codification establishes a common referencing system for accounting standards and is generally organized by subject matter 
use of the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we began to use the codification on its effective date and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the use of the codification  this form k no longer makes reference to specific accounting standards by number or title  instead  accounting standards are referred to in terms of the applicable subject matter 
in december  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting and reporting of business combinations which requires recognition of all assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree at fair value as of the date of acquisition 
in addition  this guidance requires that acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs be charged to expense as incurred  and changes the recognition and measurement criteria for certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies  contingent consideration  and bargain purchases 
this guidance is effective for business combinations with an effective date beginning january  or later 
we applied this new guidance to our acquisition of whitehead mann and sensa solutions  inc  which were acquired in fiscal in december  the fasb issued guidance on the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements which requires entities report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements and to account for the transactions with noncontrolling interest owners as equity transactions provided the parent retains controlling interests in the subsidiary 
the guidance also requires new and expanded disclosure and is effective from fiscal years beginning on or after december  we currently do not have significant minority interest in our consolidated subsidiaries and  as such  the guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued guidance that fair value disclosures required for financial instruments on an annual basis be presented for all interim reporting periods beginning with the first interim period ending after june  with earlier application permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset and liability have significantly decreased and also on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this guidance also requires expanded disclosure about how fair value is measured  changes to valuation methodologies  and additional disclosures for debt and equity securities 
this guidance was effective for reporting periods ending after june  with earlier adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
in addition  it requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated as well as the rationale for why that date was selected 
this guidance was effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and shall be applied prospectively 
adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
subsequent events through the filing date of this form k have been evaluated for disclosure and recognition and we concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued guidance on  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements 
specifically  the new guidance requires disclosure of amounts transferred in and out of levels and fair value measurements  a reconciliation presented on a gross basis rather than a net basis of activity in level fair value measurements  greater disaggregation of the assets and liabilities for which fair value measurements are presented and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level and fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the new guidance around the level activity reconciliation  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the new guidance on february  the adoption did not impact our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of stockholders equity and accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
during fiscal   and  we recognized foreign currency losses  on an after tax basis  of million  million  and million  respectively  primarily related to our south america  asia pacific and emea operations 

table of contents our primary exposure to exchange losses is based on outstanding intercompany loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened  and against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  our exchange loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  if the us dollar weakened by the same increments against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  our exchange gain would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under our facility 
we had million and million of borrowings against the csv of coli contracts as of april  and  respectively bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the csv on our coli contracts 
as of april   we held approximately million par value fair value of million of auction rate securities ars  of which all were securities collateralized by student loan portfolios  and are guaranteed by the united states government 
due to events in the global credit markets  the ars held by the company experienced failed auctions during fiscal and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment in ars in the near term may be limited or impossible 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities cannot sell these types of securities 
in august  we received a settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement with an investment security firm  which gave us the right put option to sell our auction rate securities at par value to the investment security firm between june  and july  and gave the investment security firm the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after october  as long as we receive the par value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
