details regarding this liability are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting estimates preparing the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we believe the following estimates and assumptions to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions and estimates may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and may have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our policy on revenue recognition varies based on the types of products sold and the distribution method 
we recognize operating revenue when title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
allowances for sales returns  stale products  promotions and discounts are also recorded as reductions of revenue in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue for products sold through our dsd system is recognized when the product is delivered to the retailer 
our sales representative creates the invoice at time of delivery using a handheld computer 
the invoice is transmitted electronically each day and sales revenue is recognized 
revenue for products shipped directly to the customer from our warehouse is recognized based on the shipping terms listed on the shipping documentation 
products shipped with terms fob shipping point are recognized as revenue at the time the shipment leaves our warehouses 
products shipped with terms fob destination are recognized as revenue based on the anticipated receipt date by the customer 
we allow certain customers to return products under agreed upon circumstances 
we record a returns allowance for damaged products and other products not sold by the expiration date on the product label 
this allowance is estimated based on a percentage of sales returns using historical and current market information 
we record certain reductions to revenue for promotional allowances 
there are several different types of promotional allowances such as off invoice allowances  rebates and shelf space allowances 
an off invoice allowance is a reduction of the sales price that is directly deducted from the invoice amount 
we record the amount of the deduction as a reduction to revenue when the transaction occurs 
at times  certain rebates may be offered to customers based on the quantity of product purchased over a period of time 
based on the nature of these allowances  the exact amount of the rebate is not known at the time the product is sold to the customer 
an estimate of the expected rebate amount is recorded as a reduction to revenue and an accrued liability at the time the sale is recorded 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the period covered by the promotion 
the accrual is based on historical information and the progress of the customer against the target amount 
shelf space allowances are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the agreement or three years and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
capitalized shelf space allowances are evaluated for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we also record certain allowances for coupon redemptions  scan back promotions and other promotional activities as a reduction to revenue 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the period covered by the coupon or promotion 

table of contents total allowances for sales returns  rebates  coupons  scan backs and other promotional activities included in other payables and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets increased from million at the end of to million at the end of due to a more aggressive marketing effort to drive sales growth 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable 
we record a general reserve based on analysis of historical data and the aging of accounts receivable 
in addition  management records specific reserves for receivable balances that are considered at higher risk due to known facts regarding the customer 
allowances for doubtful accounts increased from million at the end of to million at the end of due to higher accounts receivable 
self insurance reserves we maintain reserves for the self funded portions of employee medical insurance benefits 
the employer s portion of employee medical claims is limited by stop loss insurance coverage each year to million per person 
at december  and december   the accruals for our portion of medical insurance benefits were million and million  respectively 
for casualty insurance obligations  we maintain self insurance reserves for workers compensation and auto liability for individual losses up to the million insurance deductible 
in addition  general and product liability claims are self funded for individual losses up to the million insurance deductible 
claims in excess of the deductible are fully insured up to million per individual claim 
we evaluate input from a third party actuary in the estimation of the casualty insurance obligation on an annual basis 
in determining the ultimate loss and reserve requirements  we use various actuarial assumptions including compensation trends  healthcare cost trends and discount rates 
we also use historical information for claims frequency and severity in order to establish loss development factors 
the estimate of discounted loss reserves ranged from million to million in in  the estimate of discounted loss reserves ranged from million to million 
consistent with prior periods  the th percentile of this range represents our best estimate of the ultimate outstanding casualty liability 
we lowered the discount rate from in to in based on projected investment returns over the estimated future payout period  which increased the estimated claims liability by approximately million 
impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets requires us to project future financial performance  including revenue and profit growth  fixed asset and working capital investments  income tax rates and cost of capital 
these projections rely upon historical performance  anticipated market conditions and forward looking business plans 
the analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  assumes combined average annual revenue growth of approximately during the valuation period 
we also use a combination of internal and external data to develop the weighted average cost of capital 
significant investments in fixed assets and working capital to support this growth are estimated and factored into the analysis 
if the forecasted revenue growth is not achieved  the required investments in fixed assets and working capital could be reduced 
even with the excess fair value over carrying value  significant changes in assumptions or changes in conditions could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future 

table of contents depreciation and impairment of fixed assets depreciation of fixed assets is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives used in computing depreciation are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will provide economic benefits 
estimated lives are based on historical experience  maintenance practices  technological changes and future business plans 
depreciation expense was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
changes in these estimated lives and increases in capital expenditures could significantly affect depreciation expense in the future 
fixed assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of fixed assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an asset s carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized  and the adjusted carrying amount is depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
equity based incentive compensation expense determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited before vesting 
in addition  our long term equity incentive plans require assumptions and projections of future operating results and financial metrics 
actual results may differ from these assumptions and projections  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
provision for income taxes we estimate valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for the portions that we do not believe will be fully utilized based on projected earnings and usage 
our effective tax rate is based on the level and mix of income of our separate legal entities  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions that affect the annual tax rate 
unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are established when  despite the fact that the tax return positions are supportable  we believe these positions may be challenged and the results are uncertain 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a summary of new accounting standards 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to certain commodity  interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks as part of our ongoing business operations and may use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage some of these risks 
we do not use derivatives for trading purposes 
there are no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
in order to reduce the price volatility of certain ingredient  packaging and energy costs  we have entered into various forward purchase agreements with certain suppliers based on market prices  forward price projections  and expected usage levels in order to determine appropriate selling prices for our products 
as of december  and december   we had no outstanding commodity futures contracts or other derivative contracts related to ingredients and energy 
our variable rate debt obligations incur interest at floating rates based on changes in the eurodollar rate  canadian bankers acceptance discount rate  canadian prime rate and us base rate interest 
to manage exposure to changing interest rates  we selectively enter into interest rate swap agreements to maintain a desirable proportion of fixed to variable rate debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further information related to our interest rate swap agreements 
while these interest rate swap agreements fixed a portion of the interest rate at a predictable level  pre tax interest expense would have been million lower without these swaps during including the effects of the interest rate swap agreements  the weighted average interest rates for and were and  respectively 
a increase in the variable interest rate would not have significantly impacted interest expense during through the operations of our canadian subsidiary  there is an exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  primarily between us dollars and canadian dollars 
a majority of the revenue of our canadian operations is denominated in us dollars and a substantial portion of the operations costs  such as raw materials and direct labor  are denominated in canadian dollars 
we have entered into a series of forward contracts to mitigate a portion of this foreign exchange rate exposure 
these contracts have maturities through june foreign currency fluctuations favorably impacted pre tax earnings by million compared to however  this increase in pre tax earnings was offset by the unfavorable effect of derivative forward contracts of million in compared to  resulting in a net favorable impact of million in
