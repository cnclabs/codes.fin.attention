item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations going concern and continuing operations our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million and used million of cash in our operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and a total stockholders deficit of million 
due to uncertainty about our ability to meet our current operating expenses and capital expenditures  in their report on our annual financial statements for the year ended december   our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
the first of the company s notes issued to prides capital partners  llc prides which are secured by substantially all of our assets will mature on august  at that time  the company must repay the original principal amount of million  together with accrued interest of approximately million 
the company does not believe that its cash flows from operations alone will be sufficient to support repayments and otherwise satisfy its repayment obligation under this note 
the company does not have access to a long term credit facility or other source of long term funding other than the notes held by prides 
therefore  prior to the maturity date of the note due august   the company intends to reach an agreement with prides to refinance the amounts due  together with some or all of the amounts payable under the remaining notes  or to convert these amounts into equity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into an agreement with prides on satisfactory terms or at all 
the company s failure to pay all amounts when due under the note maturing on august  would constitute an event of default entitling prides  among other things  to accelerate the company s indebtedness under the remaining notes and exercise its rights as a secured creditor 
if prides is unable or unwilling to provide such additional financing the company will need to obtain such financing from a third party 
based on the company s current financial condition  the company may be unable to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
in addition  the notes require the company to obtain the consent of prides prior to incurring more than  of additional debt  which may create a material limitation on the company s ability to obtain financing from a third party 
if the company is unable to obtain a third party financing  the company will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as seeking additional equity capital  reducing operations  liquidating assets  or seeking relief through a filing under the us bankruptcy code 
any such actions could adversely affect the company s financial condition and the value of the company s common stock 
the continuation of our business is dependent upon raising additional financial support 
the additional financing may be provided by common stock  debt  project financing  joint venture projects  a strategic alliance or business combination  or a combination of these 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders 
management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement or public offering of its common stock 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional cash to finance operations 
if not  we will be required to reduce operations and or liquidate assets and or seek relief through a filing under the us bankruptcy code 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern

digital plans revenue is driven by the following two factors the average number of digital plans subscribers and the average weekly fee paid by digital plans subscribers 
for the year ended december   the average digital plans subscriber base was approximately lower than the corresponding prior year period and the average weekly fees were approximately lower than the corresponding prior year period 
fewer digital plans subscribers were added for the year compared to due to cash constraints and uncertain returns from advertising  we have significantly reduced our spending in both offline campaigns and online advertising  as well as our targeting more of our advertising investments to meal delivery 
increased competition  the growth of similar services that are offered for free  economic conditions  and our reduction in advertising expenditures have all contributed to the decline in subscribers during the last few reporting periods 
this decline appears to be abating  but our current number of subscribers is insufficient to sustain our liquidity 
as a result of these factors and to prevent further decreases in liquidity  we have diversified from a subscription based model to a more integrated business model that includes the sale of food and other weight loss products to better capture cross selling opportunities and leverage our existing customer relationships 
meal delivery had revenues of million and million  including shipping revenue  in fiscal years and  respectively  representing a decrease of for the decrease in meal delivery revenue relates to lower advertising spend during due to cash constraints

advertising expense in the first half of the year usually exceeds advertising in the second half of the year due to seasonality in the weight loss business 
as a result we have historically experienced 
index to financial statements proportionally lower or negative cash flows from operating activities in the first six months of each year 
the amount of advertising and its effectiveness is a significant driver of our operations 
our advertising commitments are typically short term in nature with most of it purchased on the spot market

our most significant accounting estimate is our reserve for refunds for digital plan and meal delivery 
since digital plan subscriber payments are deferred upon receipt  at the end of each month we reclassify a portion of our deferred revenue to reserve for refunds 
based on historical experience  approximately of digital plan subscriber sales will result in a refund issued in the subsequent month after sale 
all other refunds issued relate to current month digital plan subscriber sales 
because the revenue has not been recognized  refunds do not result in a reversal of digital plan subscription revenue 
instead  refunds result in a decrease to the amounts maintained in deferred revenue 
meal delivery refunds mainly result from late shipments or packaging issues 
based on historical experience  approximately of prior month s meal delivery sales will result in a refund  accordingly we estimate a reserve based on that assumption for future refunds 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the reserve for refunds 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions stated above  we may be exposed to income or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

index to financial statements goodwill and intangible assets asc formerly sfas  intangibles goodwill and other describes the reporting unit as an operating segment as that term is used in asc formerly sfas  segment reporting 
we operate in a single market consisting of the sale of services  information and products related to nutrition  fitness and motivation 
we have three reportable segments the us business to consumer segment  the us business to business segment and the european business segment 
we evaluate goodwill annually along these segment lines which represent our reporting units 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair value of the company s reporting units is based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
assumptions used in our impairment testing  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  and could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our impairment testing may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed impairment testing for our business to consumer segment due to continuing operating losses 
as a result  we determined that the business to consumer segment s goodwill was impaired 
this resulted in a non cash impairment of goodwill of approximately million to reduce the segment s goodwill to zero 
at december  we had million of goodwill related to the may acquisition of nutrio 
this goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and we noted no impairment as of december  accounting for employee stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation plans in accordance with asc formerly sfas r  compensation stock compensation 
under the provisions of asc  the company estimates the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using a black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula and amortizes that value to expense over the option s vesting period using the straight line attribution method 
we also account for certain options and restricted share awards using variable accounting under asc as interpreted by asc formerly eitf  equity  which requires that such costs be measured at the end of each reporting period to account for changes in the fair value of our common stock until the stock options or restricted shares are vested 
common stock is valued using the market price of common stock on the measurement date as defined in asc for such grants 
the fair value of restricted stock and vested shares is determined by the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires estimates of the expected term of the option  the volatility of the company s stock price  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
we recognize expense for all share based awards based on the fair value of the number of awards we estimate will fully vest 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the estimated fair value of share based awards and the underlying expense recorded 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under asc formerly sfas  income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we adopted asc formerly fin  income taxes overall  effective january  asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
in accordance with asc  we did not recognize any liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together 
index to financial statements with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with a few jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio as the interest rate related to our debt is fixed 
investments are made in accordance with our investment policy and consist of money market funds 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk 
due to the nature of these financial instruments the interest rate risk is deemed to be low 
we estimate that the cost of these financial instruments approximates fair value at december  foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros and fluctuations of the euro as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company has not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk
