cash dividends and tax sharing payments by brookwood to the company are contingent upon compliance with the loan covenants in brookwood s working capital revolving credit facility with key bank national association 
this limitation on the transferability of assets could adversely affect the company s operations if such payments were restricted 
compliance with corporate governance and disclosure standards is costly 
the company has spent and continues to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  sec regulations and stock exchange rules 
section of sarbanes oxley requires management s annual review and evaluation of the company s internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by management 
because the company qualifies as a smaller reporting company  the company s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation report 
in early  the company completed its first section report for the year ended december  the company continued to enhance its internal controls and completed its annual review and evaluation of its internal controls and issued its section report for the years ended december  and in april and march  respectively 
however  there is no guarantee that the company will receive management assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that internal control over financial reporting is effective in future periods 
in the event that the company s chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that the company s internal control over financial reporting is not effective as required by section of sarbanes oxley  investor perceptions of the company may be adversely affected

the company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of litigation matters  as described in item legal proceedings of this report 
although the company does not believe that the results of any of these matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  it is possible that any of the matters could result in material liability to the company 
in addition  the company has spent and will likely continue to spend significant amounts in professional fees in connection with these matters 
risks related to our textile products business the company s textile products business may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the company 
brookwood depends upon a limited number of third party suppliers for raw materials 
brookwood purchases a significant amount of the fabric and other materials it processes and sells from a small number of suppliers 
brookwood believes that the loss of any one of its suppliers would not have a long term material adverse effect because other manufacturers with which brookwood conducts business would be able to fulfill those requirements 
however  the loss of certain of brookwood s suppliers could  in the short term  adversely affect brookwood s business until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new 
table of contents supply arrangements would have terms as favorable as those contained in current supply arrangements 
some of brookwood s suppliers are entering the military markets in competition to brookwood  targeting specific military specifications  however  there has been no material effect upon brookwood s business relationship to date 
brookwood is monitoring its suppliers and any effect the current economic conditions may have upon their ability to deliver required materials in a timely manner 
the financial markets inability to determine the extent and longevity of the current economic downturn may have an effect upon key and multiple suppliers which cannot be determined at this time 
as of march   brookwood has not experienced any significant disruptions in supply as a result of shortages in fabrics or other materials from its suppliers 
the loss of one or more of brookwood s key customers could result in a significant loss of revenues 
brookwood has several customers who accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in one or more of the three years ended december  sales to one brookwood customer  tennier industries  inc tennier  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in each of the three years ended december  brookwood s relationship with tennier is ongoing 
sales to tennier  which are included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer  orc industries  inc orc  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in and brookwood s relationship with orc is ongoing 
sales to orc  which are also included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer accounted for slightly more than of sales for only 
brookwood s relationship with the customer is ongoing 
sales to that customer  which are also included in military sales  were  in  which represented of brookwood s sales 
military sales were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial growth in its military business  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
changes in military procurement practices or regulations could adversely effect brookwood s business 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in a substantial increase in military sales over prior periods 
changes in specifications or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market is highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
the company acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
global capital and credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on brookwood s business  operating results and financial condition 
the financial instruments that potentially subject brookwood to concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable 
brookwood grants credit to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition 
brookwood manages its exposure to credit risks through credit approvals  credit limits  monitoring procedures and the use of factors 
brookwood continues to monitor its customers and the effect the current economic conditions may have upon their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
as of march   brookwood s key customers were complying with their payment terms 

table of contents the amount of receivables that brookwood can factor is subject to certain limitations as specified in individual factoring agreements 
the factoring agreements expose brookwood to credit risk if any of the factors fail to meet their obligations 
brookwood seeks to manage this risk by conducting business with a number of reputable factors and monitoring the factors performance under their agreements 
brookwood continues to monitor its factors and the effect the current economic conditions may have upon their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
the parent company of one of brookwood s factors  cit group inc cit  previously announced it had liquidity issues and filed for bankruptcy on october  brookwood took steps to protect its interests with cit and expanded its relationships with other factors 
additionally  brookwood has amended its factor agreement with cit that  among other things  allows cit to be a brookwood receivables management agent in connection with post september  receivables and further clarifies brookwood s ownership of the receivables 
as of march   all of brookwood s factors were complying with payment terms in accordance with factor agreements  although such terms from the other factors have resulted in timing differences that have increased brookwood s end of month receivables balances 
brookwood s ability to comply with its revolving credit agreement is subject to future performance and other factors 
brookwood s revolving credit agreement requires compliance with various loan covenants and financial ratios  principally a total debt to tangible net worth ratio of  a requirement that net income in each quarter must exceed one dollar and a new covenant  effective december   of total funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  for the trailing four quarters  ratio not to exceed 
brookwood was in compliance with its principal loan covenants as of december   and and for all interim periods during those years  although a waiver regarding a pro forma inclusive of projected dividend total debt to tangible net worth ratio for the third quarter was granted to allow a  dividend payment in november and an amendment to the revolving credit agreement was entered into in june to allow a  dividend payment in june and restrict calendar total dividends from brookwood to brookwood is subject to many environmental regulations that may result in significant costs or liabilities or cause interruptions in its operations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are subject to a broad range of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the pollution and protection of the environment 
among the many environmental requirements applicable to kenyon and brookwood laminating are laws relating to air emissions  ozone depletion  wastewater discharges and the handling  disposal and release of solid and hazardous substances and wastes 
based on continuing internal review and advice from independent consultants  kenyon and brookwood laminating believe that they are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are also subject to such laws as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on site or off site locations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are not aware of any releases for which they may be liable under cercla or any analogous provision 
actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could increase the cost of producing the products manufactured by kenyon and brookwood laminating or otherwise adversely affect demand for their products 
widespread adoption of any prohibitions or restrictions could adversely affect the cost and or the ability to produce products and thereby have a material adverse effect upon kenyon  brookwood laminating or brookwood 
brookwood does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental requirements 
some risk of environmental liability is inherent  however  in the nature of brookwood s business 
there can be no assurance that material environmental liabilities will not arise 
it is also possible that future developments in environmental regulation could lead to material environmental compliance or cleanup costs 
brookwood s business could lose a significant competitive advantage if it fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights 
brookwood considers its patents and trademarks  in the aggregate  to be important to its business and seeks to protect this proprietary know how in part through us patent and trademark registrations 
no assurance can be given  however  that such protection will give brookwood any material competitive advantage 
in addition  brookwood maintains certain trade secrets for which  in order to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets  it has not sought patent or trademark protection 
as a result  such trade secrets could be infringed upon 
table of contents and such infringement could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position 
in july  nextec applications inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming that brookwood infringed five united states patents pertaining to internally coated webs 
nextec sought leave of court to add two additional patents to the lawsuit 
the court conducted a hearing on february  to hear argument on motions for summary judgment filed by both parties on various issues and defenses 
no ruling has yet been issued following the hearing 
brookwood intends to vigorously defend against these claims 
refer to item legal proceedings in this report for a further description of this lawsuit 
the strength of brookwood s competitors may impact its ability to maintain and grow sales  which could decrease revenues 
the cyclical nature of the textile and apparel industries  characterized by rapid shifts in military procurement  fashion and consumer demand and competitive pressures  results in both price and demand volatility 
the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in military specifications  consumer and industrial preferences  and general economic conditions affecting the textile and apparel industries  such as consumer expenditures for non durable goods 
the textile and apparel industries are also cyclical because the supply of particular products changes as competitors enter or leave the market 
brookwood sells primarily to domestic manufacturers  some of which operate offshore sewing operations 
some of brookwood s customers have moved their business offshore 
brookwood has responded by shipping fabric asia to asia and also by supplying finished products and garments directly to manufacturers 
brookwood competes with numerous domestic and foreign fabric manufacturers  including companies larger in size and having greater financial resources than brookwood 
the principal competitive factors in the woven fabrics markets are price  service  delivery time  quality and flexibility  with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of particular customers and the specific product offering 
brookwood s management believes that brookwood maintains its ability to compete effectively by providing its customers with a broad array of high quality fabrics at competitive prices on a timely basis 
there are an increasing number of competitors entering the military market 
these competitors vary and include converters from other market segments  as well as major mills  some of which are brookwood suppliers  who are selectively targeting specific military specifications 
as these companies enter the military market  the competitive pressures may result in further price and demand volatility 
changes in the trade regulatory environment could weaken brookwood s competitive position and have a material adverse effect on its business  net sales and profitability 
imports of foreign made textile and apparel products are a significant source of competition for most sectors of the domestic textile industry 
the us government has attempted to regulate the growth of certain textile and apparel imports through tariffs and bilateral agreements  which establish quotas on imports from lesser developed countries that historically account for significant shares of us imports 
despite these efforts  imported apparel  which represents the area of heaviest import penetration  is estimated to represent in excess of of the us market 
the us textile industry has been and continues to be negatively impacted by existing worldwide trade practices  including the north american free trade agreement nafta  anti dumping and duty enforcement activities by the us government and by the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies 
the establishment of the world trade organization wto in has resulted in the phase out of quotas on textiles and apparel  effective january  notwithstanding quota elimination  china s accession agreement for membership in the wto provides that wto member countries including the united states  canada and european countries may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products 
during  the united states and china agreed to a new quota arrangement  which imposed quotas on certain textile products through the end of the industry is monitoring chinese imports and continues to explore all current trade remedy laws that will address unfair trade practices that china has failed to eliminate under its wto commitment 
the united states may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported from china or other countries in such increased quantities as to cause or threaten serious damage to the relevant domestic industry generally known as anti dumping actions 
in addition  china has imposed an export tax on all 
table of contents textile products manufactured in china  brookwood does not believe this tax will have a material impact on its business 
under nafta there are no textile and apparel quotas between the us and either mexico or canada for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the three countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
also  the wto recently phased out textile and apparel quotas 
the us government has also approved the central american free trade agreement cafta with several central american countries costa rica  the dominican republic  el salvador  guatemala  honduras and nicaragua 
under cafta  textile and apparel originating from cafta countries will be duty and quota free  provided that yarn formed in the united states or other cafta countries is used to produce the fabric 
in addition  the united states recently implemented bilateral free trade agreements with bahrain  chile  israel  jordan  morocco and singapore 
although these actions have the effect of exposing brookwood s market to the lower price structures of the other countries and  therefore  continuing to increase competitive pressures  management is not able to predict their specific impact 
in  the us government unveiled a proposal to eliminate worldwide tariffs for manufactured goods by the european union has also proposed significant reductions in tariffs 
these proposals have been discussed during the ongoing wto doha round of multilateral negotiations  and could lead to further significant changes in worldwide tariffs beyond those already anticipated 
a seven year effort under the wto doha round to establish further tariff liberalization was delayed in august due to a breakdown in agricultural negotiations between developed and emerging economies 
further doha rounds are scheduled  however  major obstacles remain in the global trade talks and little progress is expected in the near term 
accordingly  brookwood believes it must fully utilize other competitive strategies to replace sales lost to importers 
one strategy is to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer application is a key element of brookwood s business plan the us government is engaged in discussions with a number of countries or trading blocs with the intent of further liberalizing trade 
authority to negotiate new fast track agreements has been granted by congress  making new agreements in this field more likely 
the us government has also entered into a free trade agreement with australia  bahrain  chile  israel  jordan  morocco and singapore 
any employee slowdown or strike or the failure to renew the collective bargaining agreement could disrupt brookwood s business 
although  on february   kenyon reached agreement for a new three year collective bargaining agreement with local t of the new england joint board of unite here union  representing approximately employees at its rhode island plant facility  effective from march  through february   any employee slowdown or strike or failure to renew the collective bargaining agreement in could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
brookwood s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
brookwood is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
risks related to our energy business risk factors for the company s energy business are not provided as the company s involvement in the energy business ceased in following the bankruptcy reorganization of its former energy affiliate  hallwood energy

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company operates as a holding company 
the principal remaining business is in the textile products industry  following the bankruptcy reorganization in of its former hallwood energy affiliate 
for financial reporting purposes  the company fully consolidates all of its subsidiaries and accounted for the investment in its hallwood energy affiliate using the equity method of accounting 
textile products 
in the three years ended december   the company derived all of its operating revenues from the textile activities of its brookwood subsidiary  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its ability to continue sales to existing customers  cost and availability of supplies  brookwood s response to competition  its ability to generate new markets and products and the effect of global trade regulation 
although the company s textile activities have generated positive cash flow in recent years  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial growth in its military business  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
military sales of   and  for  and  respectively  were higher in and higher in from the respective previous years 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in a substantial increase in military sales over prior periods 
changes in specifications or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market is highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
the company acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
unstable global nylon and chemical pricing and volatile domestic energy costs  coupled with a varying product mix  have continued to cause fluctuations in brookwood s margins  a trend that will potentially continue 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches to replace sales lost to imports 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing success of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry 
there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the us textile industry has been and continues to be negatively impacted by existing worldwide trade practices  including the north american free trade agreement nafta  the central american free trade agreement cafta  anti dumping and duty enforcement activities by the us government and by the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies 
the establishment of the world trade organization wto in has resulted in the phase out of quotas on textiles and apparel  effective january  brookwood does not believe these developments will have a material impact on its business 

table of contents under nafta and cafta there are no textile and apparel quotas between the us and the other parties for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
although these actions have the effect of exposing brookwood s market to the lower price structures of the other countries and  therefore  continuing to increase competitive pressures  management is not able to predict their specific impact 
the textile products business is not interdependent with the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank facility and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 
conversely  brookwood does not guarantee debts of the company or any of the company s subsidiaries and is not obligated to contribute additional capital to the company beyond dividend payments and the tax sharing agreement 
energy 
hallwood energy was a privately held independent oil and gas limited partnership and operated as an upstream energy company engaged in the acquisition  development  exploration  production  and sale of hydrocarbons  with a primary focus on natural gas assets 
on march   hallwood energy  hem the general partner of hallwood energy and hallwood energy s subsidiaries  filed petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the cases were adjucated in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  in in re hallwood energy  lp  etal case no 
the company was only an investor in and creditor of hallwood energy 
the bankruptcy filing did not include the company or any other of its assets 
on october   the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization of the debtors 
refer to the section investments in hallwood energy for a further discussion of the company s former energy activities  including the bankruptcy case 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
brookwood may receive instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory for delivery at a later date 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and identifies the inventory as separate from brookwood s inventory 
generally  a customer provides such instructions to accommodate its lack of available storage space for inventory 
this practice is customary in the textile industry and with respect to certain brookwood customers 
in these cases  the brookwood customer either dictates delivery dates at the time the order is placed or when the customer has not specified a fixed delivery date  the customer owns the goods and has asked brookwood to keep them in the warehouse 
for all of its bill and hold sales  brookwood has no future obligations  the customer is billed when the product is ready for shipment and expected to pay under standard billing and credit terms  regardless of the actual delivery date  and the inventory is identified and not available for brookwood s use 
the bill and hold sales held by brookwood at the end of each of the three years ended december  were not material 

table of contents deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
management is required to estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance to reduce part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considers various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected future income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded  if any 
impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes and the level of expected operating expenses 
impairment of investments accounted for under equity method 
investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment is believed to have fallen below the company s carrying value 
when such a decline is deemed other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to the statement of operations for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time 
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary  the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline  the investee s financial performance  and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value 
however  a decline in the quoted market price below the carrying amount or the existence of operating losses is not necessarily indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary 
all are factors to be evaluated 
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired 
at least annually  the company performs impairment reviews and determines if a writedown is required 
as application of the equity method of accounting resulted in the carrying value of the company s investment in hallwood energy to be reduced to zero in each of the years ended december   and  impairment reviews were not required for the investments in hallwood energy for those years 
in prior years  the company s evaluation of its investment in hallwood energy  or its predecessors  contained assumptions including i an evaluation of reserves using assumptions commonly used in the industry  some of which were not the same as are required by the sec to be used for financial reporting purposes  ii realization of fair value for various reserve categories based upon hallwood energy s historical experience  and iii value per acre in a potential sale transaction  based upon acreage owned in productive areas with shale characteristics similar to acreage previously sold by hallwood energy corporation and hallwood energy iii  lp  former energy affiliates  and other sale activity of acreage with shale formations 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to past and future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 

table of contents there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
presentation the company intends the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect its financial statements

table of contents equity losses 
as previously stated  the company recorded its pro rata share of hallwood energy s net income loss using the equity method of accounting

although no guarantee or commitment existed at december   the company loaned  to hallwood energy in january in connection with hallwood energy s  first convertible note discussed below to provide capital to continue regular ongoing operations
