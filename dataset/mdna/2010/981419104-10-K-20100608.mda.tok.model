seasonality 
the company s highest loan demand occurs generally from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand is generally lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
consequently  the company experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in its operating results and cash needs 
operating results from the company s third fiscal quarter are generally lower than in other quarters and operating results for its fourth fiscal quarter are generally higher than in other quarters 
lending and collection operations 
the company seeks to provide short term loans to the segment of the population that has limited access to other sources of credit 
in evaluating the creditworthiness of potential customers  the company primarily examines the individual s discretionary income  length of current employment  duration of residence and prior credit experience 
loans are made to individuals on the basis of the customer s discretionary income and other factors and are limited to amounts that the customer can reasonably be expected to repay from that income 
all of the company s new customers are required to complete standardized credit applications in person or by telephone at local company offices 
each of the company s local offices is equipped to perform immediate background  employment and credit checks and approve loan applications promptly  often while the customer waits 
the company s employees verify the applicant s employment and credit histories through telephone checks with employers  other employment references and a variety of credit services 
substantially all new customers are required to submit a listing of personal property that will be pledged as collateral to secure the loan  but the company does not rely on the value of such collateral in the loan approval process and generally does not perfect its security interest in that collateral 
accordingly  if the customer were to default in the repayment of the loan  the company may not be able to recover the outstanding loan balance by resorting to the sale of collateral 
the company generally approves less than of applications for loans to new customers 
the company believes that the development and continual reinforcement of personal relationships with customers improve the company s ability to monitor their creditworthiness  reduce credit risk and generate repeat loans 
it is not unusual for the company to have made a number of loans to the same customer over the course of several years  many of which were refinanced with a new loan after two or three payments 
in determining whether to refinance existing loans  the company typically requires loans to be current on a recency basis  and repeat customers are generally required to complete a new credit application if they have not completed one within the prior two years 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through refinancings of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a refinancing represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
the company actively markets the opportunity to refinance existing loans prior to maturity  thereby increasing the amount borrowed and increasing the fees and other income realized 
for fiscal  and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were refinancings of existing loans were  and  respectively 
the company allows refinancing of delinquent loans on a case by case basis for those customers who otherwise satisfy the company s credit standards 
each such refinancing is carefully examined before approval in an effort to avoid increasing credit risk 
a delinquent loan may generally be refinanced only if the customer has made payments which  together with any credits of insurance premiums or other charges to which the customer is entitled in connection with the refinancing  reduce the balance due on the loan to an amount equal to or less than the original cash advance made in connection with the loan 
the company does not allow the amount of the new loan to exceed the original amount of the existing loan 
the company believes that refinancing delinquent loans for certain customers who have made periodic payments allows the company to increase its average loans outstanding and its interest  fee and other income without experiencing a significant increase in loan losses 
these refinancings also provide a resolution to temporary financial setbacks for these borrowers and sustain their credit rating 
while allowed on a selective basis  refinancings of delinquent loans amounted to less than of the company s loan volume in fiscal to reduce late payment risk  local office staff encourage customers to inform the company in advance of expected payment problems 
local office staff also promptly contact delinquent customers following any payment due date and thereafter remain in close contact with such customers through phone calls  letters or personal visits to the customer s residence or place of employment until payment is received or some other resolution is reached 
when representatives of the company make personal visits to delinquent customers  the company s policy is to encourage the customers to return to the company s office to make payment 
company employees are instructed not to accept payment outside of the company s offices except in unusual circumstances 
in georgia  oklahoma  and illinois  the company is permitted under state laws to garnish customers wages for repayment of loans  but the company does not otherwise generally resort to litigation for collection purposes  and rarely attempts to foreclose on collateral 
insurance related operations 
in georgia  louisiana  south carolina  kentucky  and on a limited basis  alabama  new mexico  oklahoma  and tennessee  the company sells credit insurance to customers in connection with its loans as an agent for an unaffiliated insurance company 
these insurance policies provide for the payment of the outstanding balance of the company s loan upon the occurrence of an insured event 
the company earns a commission on the sale of such credit insurance  which is based in part on the claims experience of the insurance company on policies sold on its behalf by the company 
the company has a wholly owned  captive insurance subsidiary that reinsures a portion of the credit insurance sold in connection with loans made by the company 
certain coverages currently sold by the company on behalf of the unaffiliated insurance carrier are ceded by the carrier to the captive insurance subsidiary  providing the company with an additional source of income derived from the earned reinsurance premiums 
in fiscal  the captive insurance subsidiary reinsured approximately of the credit insurance sold by the company and contributed approximately million to the company s total revenues 
the company typically does not perfect its security interest in collateral securing its smaller loans by filing uniform commercial code ucc financing statements 
statutes in georgia  louisiana  south carolina  tennessee  missouri  kentucky and alabama permit the company to charge a non file or non recording insurance premium in connection with certain loans originated in these states 
these premiums are equal in aggregate amount to the premiums paid by the company to purchase non file insurance coverage from an unaffiliated insurance company 
under its non file insurance coverage  the company is reimbursed for losses on loans resulting from its policy not to perfect its security interest in collateral pledged to secure the loans 
the company generally perfects its security interest in collateral on larger loan transactions typically greater than  by filing ucc financing statements 
information technology 
paradata financial systems  a wholly owned subsidiary  is a financial services software company headquartered near st 
louis  missouri 
using the proprietary data processing software package developed by paradata  the company is able to fully automate all of its loan account processing and collection reporting 
the system provides thorough management information and control capabilities 
paradata markets its financial services data processing system to other financial services companies  but experiences significant fluctuations from year to year in the amount of revenues generated from sales of the system to third parties 
such revenues are not expected to be material to the company 
monitoring and supervision 
the company s loan operations are organized into southern  central  and western divisions  and mexico 
the southern division consists of south carolina  georgia  louisiana and alabama  the central division consists of tennessee  illinois  missouri  and kentucky  and the western division consists of texas  oklahoma  and new mexico 
several levels of management monitor and supervise the operations of each of the company s offices 
branch managers are directly responsible for the performance of their respective offices 
district supervisors are responsible for the performance of to offices in their districts  typically communicate with the branch managers of each of their offices at least weekly and visit the offices at least monthly 
the vice presidents of operations monitor the performance of all offices within their states or partial state in the case of texas  primarily through communication with district supervisors 
these vice presidents of operations typically communicate with the district supervisors of each of their districts weekly and visit each of their offices quarterly 
senior management receives daily delinquency  loan volume  charge off  and other statistical reports consolidated by state and has access to these daily reports for each branch office 
at least six times per fiscal year  district supervisors audit the operations of each office in their geographic area and submit standardized reports detailing their findings to the company s senior management 
at least once per year  each office undergoes an audit by the company s internal auditors 
these audits include an examination of cash balances and compliance with company loan approval  review and collection procedures and compliance with federal and state laws and regulations 
staff and training 
local offices are generally staffed with three to four employees 
the branch manager supervises operations of the office and is responsible for approving all loan applications 
each office generally has one or two assistant managers who contact delinquent customers  review loan applications and prepare operational reports 
each office also generally has a customer service representative who takes loan applications  processes loan applications  processes payments  assists in the preparation of operational reports  assists in collection efforts  and assists in marketing activities 
larger offices may employ additional assistant managers and customer service representatives 
new employees are required to review a detailed training manual that outlines the company s operating policies and procedures 
the company tests each employee on the training manual during the first year of employment 
in addition  each branch provides in office training sessions once every week and periodic training sessions outside the office 
the company has also implemented an enhanced training tool known as world university which provides continuous  real time  effective online training to all locations 
this allows for more training opportunities to be available to all employees throughout the course of their career with the company 
advertising 
the company actively advertises through direct mail  targeting both its present and former customers and potential customers who have used other sources of consumer credit 
the company obtains or acquires mailing lists from third party sources 
in addition to the general promotion of its loans for vacations  back to school needs and other uses  the company advertises extensively during the october through december holiday season and in connection with new office openings 
the company believes its advertising contributes significantly to its ability to compete effectively with other providers of small loan consumer credit 
advertising expenses were approximately of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal competition 
the small loan consumer finance industry is highly fragmented  with numerous competitors 
the majority of the company s competitors are independent operators with generally less than offices 
competition from nationwide consumer finance businesses is limited because these companies typically do not make loans of less than  the company believes that competition between small loan consumer finance companies occurs primarily on the basis of the strength of customer relationships  customer service and reputation in the local community  rather than pricing  as participants in this industry generally charge comparable interest rates and fees 
the company believes that its relatively larger size affords it a competitive advantage over smaller companies by increasing its access to  and reducing its cost of  capital 
in addition the company s in house integrated computer system provides data processing and the company s in house print shop provides direct mail and other printed items at a substantially reduced cost to the company 
several of the states in which the company currently operates limit the size of loans made by small loan consumer finance companies and prohibit the extension of more than one loan to a customer by any one company 
as a result  many customers borrow from more than one finance company  enabling the company  subject to the limitations of various consumer protection and privacy statutes including  but not limited to the federal fair credit reporting act and the gramm leach bliley act  to obtain information on the credit history of specific customers from other consumer finance companies 
government regulation 
u 
s 
operations 
small loan consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under various federal and state statutes  ordinances and regulations 
in general  these statutes establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates and the types and maximum amounts of fees  insurance premiums and other fees that may be charged 
in addition  state laws regulate collection procedures  the keeping of books and records and other aspects of the operation of small loan consumer finance companies 
generally  state regulations also establish minimum capital requirements for each local office 
state agency approval is required to open new branch offices 
accordingly  the ability of the company to expand by acquiring existing offices and opening new offices will depend in part on obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
a texas regulation requires the approval of the texas consumer credit commissioner for the acquisition  directly or indirectly  of more than of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company 
a louisiana statute prohibits any person from acquiring control of or more of the shares of stock of a licensed consumer lender  such as the company  without first obtaining a license as a consumer lender 
the overall effect of these laws  and similar laws in other states  is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of a nonregulated corporation 
each of the company s branch offices is separately licensed under the laws of the state in which the office is located 
licenses granted by the regulatory agencies in these states are subject to renewal every year and may be revoked for failure to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations 
in the states in which the company currently operates  licenses may be revoked only after an administrative hearing 
the company and its operations are regulated by several state agencies  including the industrial loan division of the office of the georgia insurance commissioner  the consumer finance division of the south carolina board of financial institutions  the south carolina department of consumer affairs  the texas office of the consumer credit commissioner  the oklahoma department of consumer credit  the louisiana office of financial institutions  the tennessee department of financial institutions  the missouri division of finance  the consumer credit division of the illinois department of financial institutions  the consumer credit bureau of the new mexico financial institutions division  the kentucky department of financial institutions  and the alabama state banking department 
these state regulatory agencies audit the company s local offices from time to time  and each state agency performs an annual compliance audit of the company s operations in that state 
insurance 
the company is also subject to state regulations governing insurance agents in the states in which it sells credit insurance 
state insurance regulations require that insurance agents be licensed  govern the commissions that may be paid to agents in connection with the sale of credit insurance and limit the premium amount charged for such insurance 
the company s captive insurance subsidiary is regulated by the insurance authorities of the turks and caicos islands of the british west indies  where the subsidiary is organized and domiciled 
consumer finance companies are affected by changes in state and federal statutes and regulations 
the company actively participates in trade associations and in lobbying efforts in the states in which it operates and at the federal level 
there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  media attention  initiatives  discussions and proposals regarding the entire consumer credit industry  as well as our particular business  and possible significant changes to the laws and regulations that govern our business 
in some cases  proposed or pending legislative or regulatory changes have been introduced that would  if enacted  have a material adverse effect on  or possibly even eliminate  our ability to continue our current business 
we can give no assurance that the laws and regulations that govern our business will remain unchanged or that any such future changes will not materially and adversely affect or in the worst case  eliminate  the company s lending practices  operations  profitability or prospects 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for a further discussion of the potential impact of regulatory changes on our business 
state legislation 
we are subject to numerous state laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans  lending forms and operations 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil  monetary or other penalties 
during the past year  several state legislative and regulatory proposals were introduced which  had they become law  would have had a material adverse impact on our operations and ability to continue to conduct business in the relevant state 
although to date none of these state initiatives have been successful  state legislatures continue to receive pressure to adopt similar legislation that would affect our lending operations 
in particular  a legislative initiative to limit the accessibility of installment credit to consumers in illinois and to curb perceived abuses prevalent in some forms of consumer lending has been passed by the illinois senate and concurred on by the illinois house 
the illinois general assembly now has until june   to forward the legislation to the illinois governor who can either sign it into law  veto it or amendatorily veto it 
if the governor takes no action on the legislation within days of receiving it  it automatically becomes law 
the legislation  as passed by the illinois legislature  places minimal limitations on our current operations and its impact is not expected to be material  however  should the governor exercise his amendatory veto power  that could substantially change 
in addition  any adverse change in existing laws or regulations  or any adverse interpretation or litigation relating to existing laws and regulations in any state in which we operate  could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or could lower or eliminate the profitability of our operations going forward by  among other things  reducing the amount of interest and fees we can charge in connection with our loans 
if these or other factors lead us to close our offices in a state  then in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing  we would also incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use 
if we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state  we may also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our offices and our employees in that state  with little or no revenues to offset those costs 
federal legislation 
in addition to state and local laws and regulations  we are subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations 
these laws include the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act and the regulations thereunder and the federal trade commission s credit practices rule 
these laws require the company to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower  prior to the consummation of the loan transaction  prohibit misleading advertising  protect against discriminatory lending practices and proscribe unfair credit practices 
among the principal disclosure items under the truth in lending act are the terms of repayment  the final maturity  the total finance charge and the annual percentage rate charged on each loan 
the equal credit opportunity act prohibits creditors from discriminating against loan applicants on the basis of race  color  sex  age or marital status 
pursuant to regulation b promulgated under the equal credit opportunity act  creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection 
the fair credit reporting act requires the company to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency 
the credit practices rule limits the types of property a creditor may accept as collateral to secure a consumer loan 
violations of the statutes and regulations described above may result in actions for damages  claims for refund of payments made  certain fines and penalties  injunctions against certain practices and the potential forfeiture of rights to repayment of loans 
although these laws and regulations have remained substantially unchanged for many years  the laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities are under review and are subject to change as a result of current economic conditions  changes in the make up of the current executive and legislative branches  and the political and media focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection 
see part i  item a  risk factors media reports and public perception of consumer installment loans as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition below 
any changes in such laws and regulations could force us to modify  suspend or cease part or  in the worst case  all of our existing operations 
it is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities 
the enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and prospects 
various legislative proposals addressing consumer credit transactions are currently pending in the us congress 
during the past months congress has passed laws affecting credit cards  home mortgage lending  auto finance  retail sales finance and other areas of consumer finance 
congressional members continue to receive pressure from consumer advocates and other industry opposition groups to adopt legislation to address various aspects of consumer credit transactions 
as part of a sweeping package of financial industry reform regulations  the us senate recently passed senate bill s 
entitled the restoring american financial stability act of this bill is the companion to hr entitled the wall street reform and consumer protection act of which was passed by the house of representatives in november both bills  which now go to a house senate conference committee to resolve their differences  would create a new federal regulatory entity with virtually unlimited power to regulate the form and content of all consumer financial transactions 
although the form and organizational structure of the new entity differ in some respects under the two bills the house bill would create an independent agency known as the consumer financial protection agency and the senate bill would establish a consumer financial protection bureau within the federal reserve  we believe it highly likely that a new federal regulatory entity in one form or another or some combination of the two will be part of the reconciled legislation and that the legislation will be signed into law by the president 
it is impossible to predict the effect that the creation of such an unprecedented federal regulator will have on the company s operations and on access to consumer credit in general  however  there can be no assurance that any such regulatory entity would not exercise its powers in a manner that will  either directly or indirectly  have a material and adverse effect on  or eliminate altogether  the company s ability to operate its business profitably or on terms substantially similar to those on which it currently operates 
although neither s 
nor hr authorize the new federal regulator to set interest rates on consumer loans  bills that would create a federal usury cap  applicable to all consumer credit transactions and substantially below rates at which the company could continue to operate profitably  are still pending in both houses of congress 
any federal legislative or regulatory action that severely restricts or prohibits the provision of small loan consumer credit and similar services on terms substantially similar to those we currently provide would  if enacted  have a material adverse impact on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
any federal law that would impose a national or similar annualized credit rate cap on our services  such as those currently pending in congress or in similar congressional bills  would  if enacted  almost certainly eliminate our ability to continue our current operations 
see part i  item a  risk factors federal legislative or regulatory proposals  initiatives  actions or changes that are adverse to our operations or result in adverse regulatory proceedings  or our failure to comply with existing or future federal laws and regulations  could force us to modify  suspend or cease part or all of our nationwide operations  for further information regarding the potential impact of adverse legislative and regulatory changes

risk factors forward looking statements this annual report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  as well as information currently available to management 
statements other than those of historical fact  as well as those identified by the use of words such as anticipate  estimate  plan  expect  believe  may  will  should  and similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in any such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
any such statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual financial results  performance or financial condition may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or expected 
among the key factors that could cause our actual financial results  performance or condition to differ from the expectations expressed or implied in such forward looking statements are the following recently or future enacted or proposed legislation  changes in interest rates  risks inherent in making loans  including repayment risks and value of collateral  the timing and amount of revenues that may be recognized by the company  changes in current revenue and expense trends including trends affecting charge offs  changes in the company s markets and general changes in the economy particularly in the markets served by the company  and the unpredictable nature of litigation

investors should consider the following risk factors  in addition to the other information presented in this annual report and the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec  in evaluating us  our business and an investment in our securities 
any of the following risks  as well as other risks  uncertainties  and possibly inaccurate assumptions underlying our plans and expectations  could result in harm to our business  results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline  which in turn could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment in our company 
these factors  among others  could also cause actual results to differ from those we have experienced in the past or those we may express or imply from time to time in any forward looking statements we make 
investors are advised that it is impossible to identify or predict all risks  and that risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also could affect us in the future 
unfavorable state legislative or regulatory actions or changes  adverse outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings or failure to comply with existing laws and regulations could force us to cease  suspend or modify our operations in a state  potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to numerous state laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
many of these regulations impose detailed and complex constraints on the terms of our loans  lending forms and operations 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment against us of civil  monetary or other penalties including the suspension or revocation of our licenses to lend in one or more jurisdictions 
changes in the laws under which we currently operate or the enactment of new laws governing our operations resulting from state political activities and legislative or regulatory initiatives could have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business in a particular state 
see part  item  description of business  government regulation for further discussion of such current state activities and initiatives 
federal legislative or regulatory proposals  initiatives  actions or changes that are adverse to our operations or result in adverse regulatory proceedings  or our failure to comply with existing or future federal laws and regulations  could force us to modify  suspend or cease part or all of our nationwide operations 
in addition to state and local laws and regulations  we are subject to numerous federal laws and regulations that affect our lending operations 
although these laws and regulations have remained substantially unchanged for many years  the laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities are under review and are subject to change as a result of current economic conditions  changes in the make up of the current executive and legislative branches  and the political and media focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection

see part  item  description of business government  regulation for further discussion of such current federal activities and initiatives 
media and public perception of consumer installment loans as being predatory or abusive could materially adversely affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
consumer advocacy groups and various other media sources continue to advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict our products and services 
these critics frequently characterize our products and services as predatory or abusive toward consumers 
if this negative characterization of the consumer installment loans we make and or ancillary services we provide becomes widely accepted by government policy makers or is embodied in legislative  regulatory  policy or litigation developments that adversely affect our ability to continue offering our products and services or the profitability of these products and services  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our continued expansion into mexico may increase the risks inherent in conducting international operations  contribute materially to increased costs and negatively affect our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
although our operations in mexico accounted for only of our revenues during fiscal and of our gross loans receivable at march   we intend to continue opening offices and expanding our presence in mexico 
in addition  if to the extent that the state and federal regulatory climate in the us changes in ways that adversely affect our ability to continue profitable operations in one or more us states  we could become increasingly dependent on our operations in mexico as our only viable expansion or growth strategy 
in doing so  we may expose an increasing portion of our business to risks inherent in conducting international operations  including currency fluctuations and devaluations  unsettled political conditions  communication and translation errors due to language barriers  compliance with differing legal and regulatory regimes and differing cultural attitudes toward regulation and compliance 
we are subject to interest rate risk resulting from general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve board 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence the amount of interest we pay on our revolving credit facility or any other floating interest rate obligations we may incur  which would increase our operating costs and decrease our operating margins 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our interest rate risk 
our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk 
we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to credit and market risk 
additional information regarding our exposure to credit and market risk is included in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to fund our liquidity needs 
we have an existing revolving credit agreement committed through july that allows us to borrow up to million  assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions 
if our existing sources of liquidity become insufficient to satisfy our financial needs or our access to these sources becomes unexpectedly restricted  we may need to try to raise additional debt or equity in the future 
if such an event were to occur  we can give no assurance that such alternate sources of liquidity would be available to us at all or on favorable terms 
additional information regarding our liquidity risk is included in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our revolving credit agreement contains restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business 
our revolving credit agreement contains a number of covenants that could adversely affect our business and the flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or opportunities 
among other things  these covenants limit our ability to declare or pay dividends  redeem our subordinated debt  incur additional debt or enter into a merger  consolidation or sale of substantial assets 
in addition  if we were to breach any covenants or obligations under our revolving credit agreement and such breaches were to result in an event of default  our lenders could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable  subject to applicable grace periods

any material adverse change in the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us  whether due to changes in economic conditions  the cost of consumer goods  interest rates  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  or other causes over which we have no control  would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
additional information regarding our credit risk is included in the section caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and reports of operation liquidity and capital resources 
if our estimates of loan losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses  our provision for loan losses would increase 
this would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses for loans we make directly to consumers 
this allowance is an estimate 
if our actual loan losses exceed the assumption used to establish the allowance   our provision for loan losses would increase  which would result in a decline in our future revenues and earnings

the concentration of our revenues in certain states could adversely affect us 
we currently operate consumer installment loan offices in states in the united states 
any adverse legislative or regulatory change in any one of our states but particularly in any of our larger states could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operation or financial condition 
we have a significant amount of goodwill  which is subject to periodic review and testing for impairment 
a portion of our total assets at march  is comprised of goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill is subject to periodic review and testing to determine if it is impaired 
unfavorable trends in our industry and unfavorable events or disruptions to our operations resulting from adverse legislative or regulatory actions or from other unpredictable causes could result in significant goodwill impairment charges 
controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
controls and procedures are particularly important for small loan consumer finance companies 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success significantly depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
the loss of the services of members of our senior management or key team members or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could materially harm our business 
regular turnover among our managers and other employees at our offices makes it more difficult for us to operate our offices and increases our costs of operations  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

if we are unable to keep our employee turnover rates consistent with historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our ability to manage our growth may deteriorate  and our ability to execute our growth strategy may be adversely affected 
we have experienced substantial growth in recent years 
our growth strategy  which is based on opening and acquiring offices in existing and new markets  is subject to significant risks  some of which are beyond our control  including the prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate  and  to the extent applicable  federal laws and regulations  which are subject to change at any time  our ability to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals  government permits or licenses that may be required  the degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers  our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  our ability to adapt our infrastructure and systems to accommodate our growth  and our ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans 
we currently lack product and business diversification  as a result  our revenues and earnings may be disproportionately negatively impacted by external factors and may be more susceptible to fluctuations than more diversified companies 
our primary business activity is offering small consumer installment loans together with  in some states in which we operate  related ancillary products 
thus  any developments  whether regulatory  economic or otherwise  that would hinder  reduce the profitability of or limit our ability to operate our small consumer installment loan business on the terms currently conducted would have a direct and adverse impact on our business  profitability and perhaps even our viability 
our current lack of product and business diversification could inhibit our opportunities for growth  reduce our revenues and profits and make us more susceptible to earnings fluctuations than many other financial institutions whose operations are more diversified 
interruption of  or a breach in security relating to  our information systems could adversely affect us 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
each office is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory  reconcile cash balances on a daily basis and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems  including any failure of our back up systems  could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  loan and other systems and could result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

any such catastrophic event or other unexpected disruption of our headquarters functions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
since  we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and may not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  our common stock may be less attractive to certain investors than the stock of dividend paying companies 
various provisions of our charter documents and applicable laws could delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  south carolina law  and the laws in several of the states in which our operating subsidiaries are incorporated could delay or prevent a change of control that the holders of our common stock may favor or may impede the ability of our shareholders to change our management 
in particular  our articles of incorporation and south carolina law  among other things  authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  without shareholder approval  and will require the affirmative vote of holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares of voting stock to approve our merger or consolidation with another corporation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s financial performance continues to be dependent in large part upon the growth in its outstanding loans receivable  the ongoing introduction of new products and services for marketing to its customer base  the maintenance of loan quality and acceptable levels of operating expenses 
since march   gross loans receivable have increased at a annual compounded rate from million to million at march  the increase reflects both the higher volume of loans generated through the company s existing offices and the contribution of loans generated from new offices opened or acquired over the period 
during this same five year period  the company has grown from offices to offices as of march  during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately new offices in the united states  new offices in mexico and evaluate acquisition opportunities 
the company attempts to identify new products and services for marketing to its customer base

comparison of fiscal versus fiscal net income was million during fiscal  a increase over the million earned during fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income revenues less provision for loan losses and general and administrative expenses of million  or  and a million decrease in interest expense  offset by an increase in income tax expense 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal  a million  or  increase over the million in fiscal revenues from the offices open throughout both fiscal years increased by 
at march   the company had offices in operation  an increase of offices from march  interest and fee income during fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal this increase resulted from an increase of million  or  in average net loans receivable between the two fiscal years 
the increase in average loans receivable was attributable to the company s internal growth 
during fiscal  internal growth increased because the company opened new offices and the average loan balance increased from to insurance commissions and other income increased by million  or  over the two fiscal years 
insurance commissions increased by million  or  as a result of the increase in loan volume in states where credit insurance is sold 
other income increased slightly  but there were various changes within other income when comparing the two years  including revenue from tax preparation increased approximately million  or in fiscal  a million gain on the interest rate swaps was recorded compared to an approximate  loss is fiscal in fiscal  the company extinguished million par value of its convertible notes at a million gain  compared to fiscal  during which million par value of the convertible notes were extinguished at a million gain 
in fiscal  a million gain was recognized on the sale of a foreign currency option 
there was no such gain recorded during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this extinguishment of debt 
the provision for loan losses during fiscal increased by million  or  from the previous year 
this increase resulted from a combination of increases in both the allowance for loan losses and the amount of loans charged off 
net charge offs for fiscal amounted to million  a increase over the million charged off during fiscal accounts that were days or more past due decreased from to on a recency basis and from to on a contractual basis when comparing march  to march  during the current fiscal year  we have also had a reduction in our year over year loan losses 
annualized net charge offs as a percentage of average net loans decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal although this represents a basis point decrease  the current year ratio is slightly higher than historical charge off ratios 
historically from fiscal to fiscal the charge offs as a percent of average loans ranged from to 
in fiscal the company experienced a temporary decline to  which was attributed to a change in the bankruptcy law 
however  in fiscal the ratio returned  which was more in line with historical rates 
because the ratio in fiscal is slightly higher than historical levels and we did see improvements during fiscal compared to fiscal  we believe that we will continue to see slight improvement in our loss ratios in the near future  however  there is no assurance they will return to historical levels anytime soon 
during fiscal year our charge offs as a percent of average net loans decreased to from in fiscal we believe our customer base is highly impacted by the cost of basic commodities such as food and energy and unemployment 
the cost of basic commodities rose steeply during the first several months of our fiscal which had a negative impact on our customer s ability to repay outstanding loans 
this  in turn  drove our charge off ratio up significantly over our historical experience 
after moderating in the second half of fiscal  the costs of basic commodities have risen more gradually during fiscal allowing our customers to adapt to such costs increases and better manage their ability to repay outstanding loans 
the rate of unemployment has also stabilized 
we believe these are major factors in the reduction of our charge off ratio during fiscal general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased by million  or  over the previous fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to costs associated with the new offices opened or acquired during the fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses  when divided by average open offices  increased slightly when comparing the two fiscal years and  overall  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased from in fiscal to during fiscal this decrease resulted from the reduction of branch openings during fiscal and management s ongoing monitoring and control of expenses 
management plans to increase the number of branch openings in fiscal compared to fiscal  therefore  the company may not experience similar reductions in general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues in fiscal interest expense decreased by million  or  during fiscal  as compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of a decrease in average debt outstanding of and a slight decrease in average interest rates 
average interest rates decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal income tax expense increased million  or  primarily from an increase in pre tax income 
the effective rate remained consistent at in fiscal compared to in fiscal comparison of fiscal versus fiscal net income was million during fiscal  a increase over the million earned during fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income revenues less provision for loan losses and general and administrative expenses of million  or  a reduction in the income tax effective rate and a reduction in interest expense 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal  a million  or  increase over the million in fiscal revenues from the offices open throughout both fiscal years increased by 
at march   the company had offices in operation  an increase of offices from march  interest and fee income during fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal this increase resulted from an increase of million  or  in average net loans receivable between the two fiscal years 
the increase in average loans receivable was attributable to the company acquiring approximately million in net loans and internal growth 
during fiscal  internal growth increased because the company opened new offices and the average loan balance increased from to insurance commissions and other income increased by million  or  over the two fiscal years 
insurance commissions increased by million  or  as a result of the increase in loan volume in states where credit insurance is sold 
other income increased by million  or  over the two years  primarily due to a million gain on the sale of a foreign currency option and a million gain on the extinguishment of million par value of the convertible notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding this extinguishment of debt 
this increase was partially offset by approximately a million loss related to our interest rate swap 
the provision for loan losses during fiscal increased by million  or  from the previous year 
this increase resulted from a combination of increases in both the allowance for loan losses and the amount of loans charged off 
net charge offs for fiscal amounted to million  a increase over the million charged off during fiscal net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased from to when comparing the two annual periods 
we believe the percentage point increase resulted from the difficult economic environment and higher energy cost that our customers faced 
accounts that were days or more past due on a recency basis increased from to and on a contractual basis increased from to at march  and march   respectively 
general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased by million  or  over the previous fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to costs associated with the new offices opened or acquired during the fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses  when divided by average open offices  remained flat when comparing the two fiscal years and  overall  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased from in fiscal to during fiscal this decrease resulted from management s ongoing monitoring and control of expenses

average interest rates decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal income tax expense increased million  or  primarily from an increase in pre tax income

critical accounting policies the company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the finance company industry 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies involve significant judgment by the company s management  including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
as a result  changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and share based compensation to be its most critical accounting policies due to the significant degree of management judgment involved 
allowance for loan losses the company has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that take into consideration various assumptions and estimates with respect to the loan portfolio 
the company s assumptions and estimates may be affected in the future by changes in economic conditions  among other factors 
for additional discussion concerning the allowance for loan losses  see credit quality below 
share based compensation the company measures compensation cost for share based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life  changes to which can materially affect the fair value estimate 
in addition  the estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised 
the company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
income taxes management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a periodic basis as regulatory and business factors change 
no assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by management or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the us tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service irs or state taxing authorities 
the company is subject to potential adverse adjustments  including but not limited to an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent non deductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
the company adopted fasb asc prior authoritative literature fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on april  under fasb asc  the company includes the current and deferred tax impact of its tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than that such positions will be sustained by taxing authorities  with full knowledge of relevant information  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
while the company supports its tax positions by unambiguous tax law  prior experience with the taxing authority  and analysis that considers all relevant facts  circumstances and regulations  management must still rely on assumptions and estimates to determine the overall likelihood of success and proper quantification of a given tax position 
credit quality the company s delinquency and net charge off ratios reflect  among other factors  changes in the mix of loans in the portfolio  the quality of receivables  the success of collection efforts  bankruptcy trends and general economic conditions 
delinquency is computed on the basis of the date of the last full contractual payment on a loan known as the recency method and on the basis of the amount past due in accordance with original payment terms of a loan known as the contractual method 
management closely monitors portfolio delinquency using both methods to measure the quality of the company s loan portfolio and the probability of credit losses 
the following table classifies the gross loans receivable of the company that were delinquent on a recency and contractual basis for at least days at march    and at march  dollars in thousands recency basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable contractual basis days past due days or more past due total percentage of period end gross loans receivable loans are charged off at the earlier of when such loans are deemed to be uncollectible or when six months have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment 
the company s charge off policy has been consistently applied and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported 
management considers the charge off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
charge offs as a percent of average net loans decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of the company s loans were generated through refinancings of outstanding loans and the origination of new loans to previous customers 
a refinancing represents a new loan transaction with a present customer in which a portion of the new loan proceeds is used to repay the balance of an existing loan and the remaining portion is advanced to the customer 
for fiscal   and  the percentages of the company s loan originations that were refinancings of existing loans were  and  respectively 
the company s refinancing policies  while limited by state regulations  in all cases consider the customer s payment history and require that the customer has made at least two payments on the loan being considered for refinancing 
a refinancing is considered a current refinancing if the customer is no more than days delinquent on a contractual basis 
delinquent refinancings may be extended to customers that are more than days past due on a contractual basis if the customer completes a new application and the manager believes that the customer s ability and intent to repay has improved 
it is the company s policy to not refinance delinquent loans in amounts greater than the original amounts financed 
in all cases  a customer must complete a new application every two years 
during fiscal  delinquent refinancings represented less than of the company s total loan volume compared to in fiscal charge offs  as a percentage of loans made by category  are greatest on loans made to new borrowers and less on loans made to former borrowers and refinancings 
this is as expected due to the payment history experience available on repeat borrowers 
however  as a percentage of total loans charged off  refinancings represent the greatest percentage due to the volume of loans made in this category 
the following table depicts the charge offs as a percent of loans made by category and as a percent of total charge offs during fiscal loan volume percent of charge off as a percent of total by category total charge offs loans made by category refinancing former borrowers new borrowers the company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount that  in management s opinion  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the company charges against current earnings  as a provision for loan losses  amounts added to the allowance to maintain it at levels expected to cover probable losses of principal 
when establishing the allowance for loan losses  the company takes into consideration the growth of the loan portfolio  the mix of the loan portfolio  current levels of charge offs  current levels of delinquencies  and current economic factors 
in accordance with fasb asc topic prior authoritative literature statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  the company accrues an estimated loss if it is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
it is probable that there are losses in the existing portfolio 
to estimate the losses  the company uses historical information for net charge offs and average loan life 
this method is based on the fact that many customers refinance their loans prior to the contractual maturity 
average contractual loan terms are approximately nine months and the average loan life is approximately four months 
based on this method  the company had an allowance for loan losses that approximated six months of average net charge offs at march    and therefore  at each year end the company had an allowance for loan losses that covered estimated losses for its existing loans based on historical charge offs and average lives 
in addition  the entire loan portfolio turns over approximately three times during a typical twelve month period 
therefore  a large percentage of loans that are charged off during any fiscal year are not on the company s books at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company believes that it is not appropriate to provide for losses on loans that have not been originated  that twelve months of net charge offs are not needed in the allowance  and that the method employed is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company records acquired loans at fair value based on current interest rates  less an allowance for uncollectibility and collection costs 
fasb asc topic prior authoritative literature statement of position no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  was adopted by the company on april  fasb asc topic prohibits carryover or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of the accounting literature 
management believes that a loan has shown deterioration if it is over days delinquent 
the company believes that loans acquired since the adoption of fasb asc topic have not shown evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination  and therefore  are not within the scope of fasb asc topic because there is no consideration paid for acquired loans over days delinquent 
for the years ended march  and  the company recorded adjustments of approximately million and million  respectively  to the allowance for loan losses in connection with acquisitions in accordance generally accepted accounting principles 
no adjustment was recorded for the year ended march  these adjustments represent the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans which are not within the scope of fasb asc topic the company believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses in the existing portfolio at march  the following is a summary of the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended march    and march  balance at the beginning of the year provision for loan losses loan losses recoveries translation adjustment allowance on acquired loans balance at the end of the year allowance as a percentage of loans receivable  net of unearned and deferred fees net charge offs as a percentage of average loans receivable average loans receivable have been determined by averaging month end gross loans receivable less unearned interest and deferred fees over the indicated period 
quarterly information and seasonality the company s loan volume and corresponding loans receivable follow seasonal trends 
the company s highest loan demand typically occurs from october through december  its third fiscal quarter 
loan demand has generally been the lowest and loan repayment highest from january to march  its fourth fiscal quarter 
loan volume and average balances typically remain relatively level during the remainder of the year
