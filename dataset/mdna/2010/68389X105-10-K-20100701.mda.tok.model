item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends  including changes to our business as a result of our acquisition of sun microsystems  inc sun in fiscal this overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
we then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
business overview we are the world s largest enterprise software company 
as a result of our acquisition of sun in january  we are also a leading provider of hardware systems products and services 
we develop  manufacture  market  distribute and service database and middleware software  applications software and hardware systems  consisting primarily of computer server and storage products  which are designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations 
our goal is to be the world s most complete  open and integrated enterprise software and hardware company 
we offer customers scalable  reliable  secure and integrated software and hardware solutions that are designed to improve transactional efficiencies  adapt to an organization s unique needs and allow better ways to access and manage information and automate business processes at a lower total cost of ownership 
we seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets 
we believe our internal  or organic  growth and continued innovation with respect to our software  hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long term strategic plan 
in fiscal  and we invested billion  billion and billion  respectively  in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products  features and services 
we also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position  expands our customer base  provides greater scale to accelerate innovation  grows our revenues and earnings  and increases stockholder value 
in recent years  we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies  products  services and technologies that add to  are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy 
we are organized into three businesses software  hardware systems and services which are further divided into seven operating segments 
each of these businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
although we report our actual results in us dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
an overview of our three businesses and seven operating segments follows 
software business our software business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  is comprised of two operating segments new software licenses and software license updates and product support 
on a constant currency basis  we expect that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and software license updates and product support offerings  including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts  and due to our acquisitions  which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development 
new software licenses we license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes  government agencies  educational institutions and resellers 
as a result of our acquisition of sun  we acquired certain software technologies  including java  which is a global software development platform used in a wide range of computers  networks and devices 

table of contents the growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our software products  our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations 
the substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions  we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing quarter period as provided in our quarterly reports on form q provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business 
new software license revenues represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the proportion of our new software license revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun 
our new software license segment s margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term 
however  our new software license segment s margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies that we have acquired  including sun 
software license updates and product support customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period  as well as technical support assistance 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
the growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts  the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses  and the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired 
software license updates and product support revenues  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  is our highest margin business unit 
the proportion of our software license updates and product support revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun 
support margins during fiscal were and accounted for of our total margins 
our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to support obligations assumed in business combinations described further below and by amortization of intangible assets 
however  over the longer term  we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal  substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses  resulting in a further increase in our support contract base 
even if new software license revenues growth was flat  software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts  which add to our support contract base  and our acquisitions have increased our support contract base  as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported 
we record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
as a result  as required by business combination accounting rules  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
to the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 

table of contents hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun in january  we entered into a new hardware systems business 
our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments hardware systems products and hardware systems support 
our hardware business represented of our total revenues in fiscal and we expect that it will continue to add a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results 
we expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services  including direct materials and labor costs 
we expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services or develop new hardware products and services 
to produce our hardware products  we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners 
our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly  test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems 
for all other manufacturing  we rely on third party manufacturing partners 
we distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities 
one of our main goals is to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types  through a reduction of the number of assembly and distribution centers we rely on and through our transition to a build to order process in which products are built only after customers have placed firm orders 
in addition  we are focusing on identifying hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of new hardware products 
hardware systems products our hardware systems products consist primarily of computer server and storage product offerings and hardware related software  including our solaris operating system 
we offer a wide range of server systems using our sparc microprocessor 
our sparc servers are differentiated by their size  cost  form factor or configuration rack  blade or stand alone systems and customer environments that they target general purpose or specialized systems 
our mid and large size servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs 
our sparc servers run the solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale 
we also offer a wide range of x servers differentiated by the same features as our sparc servers 
these x systems are substantially based upon microprocessor platforms from intel corporation and are also compatible with solaris  linux  windows and other operating systems 
our storage products are designed to securely manage  protect  archive and restore customers data assets and consist of tape  disk and networking solutions for open systems and mainframe server environments 
prior to our acquisition of sun  the majority of sun s hardware systems products were sold through indirect channels 
although we plan to continue to sell our hardware products through indirect channels  including independent distributors and value added resellers  we have begun enhancing direct sales coverage for our hardware systems products and intend that our direct sales force will sell proportionately more of our hardware systems products in the future than they do currently 
our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of sun 
in addition  business combination accounting rules require us to record acquired inventories at fair value  which generally will result in an unfavorable short term impact to our expenses and operating margins as we sell these acquired inventories to customers in the post combination period 
we have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues 
the timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues  expenses and operating margins that we report 

table of contents hardware systems support customers that purchase our hardware systems products may also elect to purchase our hardware systems support offerings 
our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our systems and storage products  including solaris  and can include product repairs  maintenance services  and technical support services 
typically  our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration 
the growth of our hardware systems support revenues is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of purchases of hardware products  the mix of hardware products purchased  and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts 
all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available 
our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed through  and by the amortization of intangible assets resulting from  our acquisition of sun 
as required by business combination accounting rules  we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisition of sun to their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date by an aggregate of million for fiscal this amount would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by sun as a standalone entity 
to the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the support periods 
services business our services business consists of consulting  on demand and education 
as a result of our acquisition of sun  we expanded and enhanced our customer base and services offerings  which we believe will increase our revenues and expenses in comparison to recent periods 
our services business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  has significantly lower margins than our software business 
the proportion of our services revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun 
consulting our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in enterprise architecture design and implementation  business it strategy alignment  business process simplification  solution integration  and product implementation  enhancements  and upgrades 
the amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services  if purchased  are typically segmentable from the products with which they relate and are performed after the customer s purchase of the products 
our consulting revenues are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of product revenues  in particular the new software license sales of our application products 
to the extent we are able to grow our products revenues  in particular our software application product revenues  we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues 
on demand on demand includes our oracle on demand and our advanced customer services offerings 
as a result of our acquisition of sun  we increased the volume and breadth of our on demand services offerings  primarily with additional advanced customer services offerings  including staff augmentation and managed services  to architect  implement and manage customer it environments 
we believe that our on demand offerings provide our customers flexibility in how they manage their it environments and an additional opportunity to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage 
while we have grown the base of customers that purchase certain of our on demand services through our organic growth and the acquisition of sun  we continue to focus on managing our expenses to increase our margins and margins as a percentage of our revenues 
we have made and plan to continue to make investments in our on demand business to support current and future revenue growth  which historically has negatively impacted on demand margins and could do so in the future 
education the purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues 
education revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions including our acquisition of sun  general economic 
table of contents conditions  personnel reductions in our customers information technology departments  tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions 
in recent periods  we believe the global economic environment has unfavorably affected customer demand for our education services  which has negatively impacted our revenues and margins 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy 
in recent years  we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies  products  services and technologies including sun in fiscal and bea systems  inc in fiscal  among others 
we believe our acquisition program supports our long term strategic direction  strengthens our competitive position  expands our customer base  provides greater scale to accelerate innovation  grows our revenues and earnings  and increases stockholder value 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
we believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  amounts available under our existing debt facilities  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings  operating margin  cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap as set forth in the financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification codification and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the sec 
gaap  as set forth within the codification  requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition business combinations goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments accounting for income taxes legal and other contingencies stock based compensation allowances for doubtful accounts in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition our sources of revenues include software  which includes new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues  hardware systems  which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers and storage products  and hardware systems support revenues  and services  which include software and hardware related services including consulting  on demand and education revenues 
revenue recognition for software products and software related services software elements new software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database  middleware and applications software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and product support revenues 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in asc  software revenue recognition  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize new software license revenues when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy  for example  in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature  we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example  acceptance provisions that are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts  which are entered into at the customer s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support includes internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements software products and software related services software arrangements we often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and services from us at the same time  or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multiple element arrangements 
such software related multiple element arrangements include the sale of our software products  software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements 
for those software related multiple element arrangements  we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of license revenues to be recognized pursuant to asc under the residual method  if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement 
we allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe described further below  with any remaining amount allocated to the software license 

table of contents revenue recognition for hardware systems products and hardware systems related services nonsoftware elements revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers and storage products 
our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc  revenue recognition  and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products and hardware systems related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
revenues from the sales of hardware products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met 
when applicable  we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items 
where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example  acceptance provisions that are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our systems and storage products and can also include product repairs  maintenance services  and technical support services 
hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements 
revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements hardware systems products and hardware systems related services nonsoftware arrangements in the third quarter of fiscal  we early adopted the provisions of accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu and accounting standards update  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu amended existing accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
to the extent a deliverable within a multiple element arrangement is not accounted for pursuant to other accounting standards  including asc  software revenue recognition  asu establishes a selling price hierarchy that allows for the use of an estimated selling price esp to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither vsoe nor third party evidence tpe is available for that deliverable 
asu modifies the scope of asc to exclude tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
in addition  asu provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to nonsoftware and software deliverables in an arrangement where the vendor sells tangible products containing software components that are essential in delivering the tangible product s functionality 
as a result of our early adoption of asu and asu  we applied the provisions of these accounting standards updates as of the beginning of fiscal the impact of our adoption of asu and asu was not material to our results of operations for fiscal we enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time  or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multiple element arrangements 
each element within a nonsoftware multiple element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services  delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 
where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met  the deliverable is combined with the 
table of contents undelivered element s and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition 
for those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting  we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period 
for the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we allocate revenue to hardware systems and services based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements 
for our nonsoftware multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception 
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available  tpe if vsoe is not available  or esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available a description as to how we determine vsoe  tpe and esp is provided below 
if a tangible hardware systems product includes software  we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product s essential functionality and  if so  the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable 
the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions 
to determine the selling price in multiple element arrangements  we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support  based on the renewal rates offered to customers 
for nonsoftware multiple element arrangements  tpe is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers 
if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doesn t exist  we determine esp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  geographies in which we offer our products and services  internal costs and stage of the product lifecycle 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategy 
as our  or our competitors  pricing and go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes to our determination of vsoe  tpe and esp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period 
selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices 
revenue recognition policies applicable to both software and nonsoftware elements revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements arrangements with software and nonsoftware elements we also enter into multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products  hardware systems support  new software licenses  software license updates and product support  consulting  on demand and education 
in such arrangements  we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements 
we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in asc and our policies described above 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements  we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above 
other revenue recognition policies applicable to software and nonsoftware elements many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in asc the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance 
table of contents criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
on demand is comprised of oracle on demand and advanced customer services and is a part of our services business 
oracle on demand services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services 
our on demand services provide multi featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our software and hardware systems products delivered at our data center facilities  select partner data centers or customer facilities 
advanced customer services provide customers with services to architect  implement and manage customer it environments including software and hardware systems product management services  industry specific solution support centers and remote and on site expert services 
depending upon the nature of the arrangement  revenues from on demand services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period  which is generally one year or less 
education revenues are a part of our services business and include instructor led  media based and internet based training in the use of our software and hardware products 
education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered 
if an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions  then new software license revenues and or hardware systems products revenues  including the costs of hardware systems products  are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
contract accounting is applied to any bundled software  hardware systems and services arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees  where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product  where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted  or where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 
for the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements 
we also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  the essential use of the software or hardware systems products and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote  we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
however  payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
payments that are due within six months are 
table of contents generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
while most of our arrangements for sales within our software and hardware systems businesses include short term payment terms  we have a standard practice of providing long term financing to creditworthy customers through our financing division 
since fiscal  when our financing division was formed  we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery  net of any payment discounts from financing transactions 
we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in asc  transfers and servicing 
in addition  we sell hardware products to leasing companies that  in turn  lease these products to end users 
in transactions where the leasing companies have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end user  we recognize revenue at point of shipment or point of delivery  depending on the shipping terms and if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in arrangements where the leasing companies have more than insignificant recourse to us in the event of default by the end user defined as recourse leasing  we recognize both the product revenue and the related cost of the product as the payments are made to the leasing company by the end user  generally ratably over the lease term 
our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies concurrent transactions 
software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
when we acquire goods or services from a customer  we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction  at terms we consider to be at arm s length  and settle the purchase in cash 
we recognize new software license revenues or hardware systems product revenues from concurrent transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 
business combinations in fiscal  we adopted asc  business combinations  which revised the accounting guidance that we were required to apply for our acquisitions in comparison to prior fiscal years 
the underlying principles are similar to the previous guidance and require that we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of adopting the revised accounting guidance provided for by asc as of the beginning of fiscal  certain of our policies differ when accounting for acquisitions in fiscal and prospective periods in comparison to the accounting for acquisitions in fiscal and prior periods  including the fair value of in process research and development is recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed  at which time the intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life  or abandoned  at which time the intangible asset is expensed prior to fiscal  in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date  
table of contents the direct transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred prior to fiscal  direct transaction costs were included as part of the purchase price  the costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company are accounted for separately from the business combination prior to fiscal  restructuring and exist costs were included as a part of the assumed obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation  and any changes in estimates associated with income tax valuation allowances or uncertain tax positions after the measurement period are generally recognized as income tax expense with application of this policy also applied prospectively to all of our business combinations regardless of the acquisition date prior to fiscal  any such changes in estimates associated with income taxes were generally included as a part of the purchase price allocation indefinitely 
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  hardware systems product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of both software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair values of these support obligations are determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the products acquired 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
we also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of million  million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by sun as an independent entity in the amount of million for fiscal historically  substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we intend to focus our efforts on renewing acquired hardware systems support contracts 
to the extent software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the substantial majority of which are one year 

table of contents in connection with a business combination  we estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management 
restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management  but may be refined in subsequent periods 
as noted above  we account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination 
these costs are accounted for as one time termination and exit costs pursuant to asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred 
when estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities  assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub lease payments to be received  which can differ materially from actual results 
this may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and  if so  to determine their estimated amounts 
if we determine that a pre acquisition contingency non income tax related is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date  we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation 
we often continue to gather information for and evaluate our pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre acquisition contingencies during the measurement period  such amounts will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and  subsequently  in our results of operations 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value or tax related valuation allowances  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the provisions of asc require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge  nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal or 
table of contents we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal  or accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the united states could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  historical earnings  taxable income in prior years  if carryback is permitted under the law  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination  or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can materially impact our effective tax rate 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly 
table of contents judgmental 
a description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under business combinations above 
for those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination  we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to asc  income taxes  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  judicial rulings  refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
in addition  as a part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
a description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under business combinations above 
for legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination  we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  we have applied certain of the provisions of the sec s guidance contained in asc  in our accounting for stock based compensation awards 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures upon historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
in addition  to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
as required by asc  we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments that are expected to vest 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated  forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates 
stock based compensation expense recorded using an 
table of contents estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly 
we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a black scholes merton valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we use the implied volatility of our publicly traded  longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification 
our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our board of directors 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense that we record to vary 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination  at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction 
because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction  the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method pursuant to asc to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded  longest term options  refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements  amongst other potential impacts  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable  the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of sun in our third quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of bea systems  inc in our fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents in our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal  we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues  software license updates and product support revenues  hardware systems products revenues as applicable and hardware systems support revenues as applicable for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we also are able to quantify the total incremental expenses associated with our hardware systems products and hardware systems support operating segments 
for fiscal  we include estimates of sun s contributions to our total revenues and total operating income 
these sun estimates are based in part on management s estimates and allocations of sun s direct revenue and expense contributions which cannot be separately identified as a result of our ongoing integration of the sun and oracle businesses 
the incremental contributions of our other acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented 
we caution readers that  while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies  including our sales force integration efforts 
we believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated  the relative mix of products sold would have been different  and although substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we intend to focus our efforts on renewing hardware systems support contracts  the amounts shown as software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew 
constant currency presentation our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses 
as a result  total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the us dollar against major international currencies 
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure 
to present this information  current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars are converted into us dollars at constant exchange rates us the rates in effect on may   which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods 
for example  if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of million euros from products sold on may  and may   our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of million in fiscal using as the month end average exchange rate for the period and million in fiscal using as the month end average exchange rate for the period 
the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal results using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate  in this example  no change in revenues during the period 
in each of the tables below  we present the percent change based on actual  unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency

total revenues increased in fiscal due to an estimated billion revenue contribution from sun  primarily in our hardware systems business  and an increase in our total software revenues resulting from growth in our new software licenses revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in our total services revenues that we believe was caused by weaker demand for it services due to the deterioration in global economic conditions in recent periods 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed  emea contributed and apac contributed to our total revenues growth 
excluding the unfavorable effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal was due to additional operating expenses incurred as a result of our acquisition of sun  including increased expenses pertaining to hardware systems products sold and related hardware systems support offerings  additional employee related expenses including additional stock based compensation  and an increase in intangible asset amortization 
in addition  we also incurred increased restructuring expenses resulting from our sun restructuring plan and legacy oracle based restructuring plans 
these increases were partially offset by expense reductions in our legacy oracle based operations including expense reductions in our services business  reductions in bad debt expenses due to improved collections and reductions to travel expenses due to cost management initiatives 

table of contents on a constant currency basis  our operating margin increased during fiscal due to higher revenues from our software business  partially offset by an estimated million reduction to our operating income from sun 
our operating margin as a percentage of revenues declined in fiscal due to the post combination expense contributions from our new hardware systems business and due to our acquisition related expenses  restructuring expenses and amortization of intangible assets  which increased at a faster rate than our total revenues  primarily due to sun 
fiscal compared to fiscal our operating results for fiscal were unfavorably impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other major international currencies 
these currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total revenues growth of percentage points during fiscal on a constant currency basis  total revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to higher software license update and product support revenues in all regions and incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions  primarily our acquisition of bea 
on a constant currency basis  new software license revenues contributed to the growth in total revenues  software license updates and product support revenues contributed and services revenues contributed 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed to the increase in total revenues  emea contributed and asia pacific contributed 
favorable currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total operating expense growth of percentage points during fiscal excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in operating expenses in fiscal is primarily due to higher salary expenses associated with increased headcount levels from acquisitions primarily bea and higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions primarily bea 
in addition  acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal due to a million gain on property sale recognized in fiscal  which decreased our net operating expenses in that period 
these increases were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our variable compensation expenses 
currency variances resulted in a reduction of percentage points to our total operating margin growth during fiscal on a constant currency basis  total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal as the growth rate of our total revenues exceeded the growth rate of our total operating expenses 
the growth rate in our total operating expenses was significantly impacted by the growth rate in our intangible asset amortization  which was primarily due to intangible assets acquired as a part of the bea transaction  and to a lesser extent  our restructuring expenses growth 
supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains and estimated sun margin contribution to supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future 
you should review the introduction under impact of acquisitions above for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre and post acquisition information 
our operating results include the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions as well as certain other significant expense and income items year ended may  in millions supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains software license updates and product support deferred revenues hardware systems support deferred revenues hardware systems products expenses amortization of intangible assets acquisition related and other restructuring stock based compensation income tax effects total supplemental disclosure related to estimated sun margin contribution estimated operating loss contribution from sun estimated operating income contribution from sun  as adjusted 
table of contents in connection with purchase price allocations related to our acquisitions  we have estimated the fair values of the software support and hardware systems support obligations assumed 
due to our application of business combination accounting rules  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities  in the amounts of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by sun as an independent entity in the amount of million for fiscal approximately million and million of estimated software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal  fiscal and beyond  respectively  that would have otherwise been recognized by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of these business combination accounting rules 
in addition  approximately million  million and million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  that would have otherwise been recognized by sun as an independent entity 
to the extent customers renew these support contracts  we expect to recognize revenues for the full contract value over the support renewal period 
represents the effects of fair value adjustments to our inventories acquired from sun that were sold to customers in the periods presented 
business combination accounting rules require us to account for inventories assumed from our acquisitions at their fair values 
the million included in the hardware systems products expenses line in the table above is intended to reflect our hardware systems products expenses that would have been otherwise recorded by sun as a standalone entity upon the sale of these inventories 
if we acquire inventories in future acquisitions  we will be required to assess their fair values  which may result in fair value adjustments to those inventories 
represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions  primarily sun microsystems  inc  bea systems  inc  hyperion solutions corporation  siebel systems  inc 
and peoplesoft  inc as of may   estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total intangible assets subject to amortization in process research and development total intangible assets  net acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees  stock based compensation expenses  integration related professional services  certain business combination adjustments after the measurement period or purchase price allocation period has ended  and certain other operating expenses  net 
for fiscal  acquisition related and other expenses include a gain on property sale of million 
as a result of our adoption of asc  business combinations  as of the beginning of fiscal  certain acquisition related and other expenses are now recorded as expenses in our statements of operations that had been historically included as a part of the consideration transferred and capitalized as a part of our accounting for acquisitions pursuant to previous accounting rules  primarily direct transaction costs such as professional services fees see further discussion under business combinations within the critical accounting policies and estimates section above 
substantially all restructuring expenses during fiscal relate to employee severance  facility exit costs and contract termination costs in connection with our fiscal oracle restructuring plan and our sun restructuring plan 
restructuring expenses during fiscal primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to the fiscal oracle restructuring plan and the fiscal oracle restructuring plan 
restructuring expenses incurred during fiscal primarily relate to costs incurred pursuant to the fiscal oracle restructuring plan 
as a result of our adoption of asc  business combinations as of the beginning of fiscal  in connection with any acquisition that we close we will record involuntary termination and other exit costs associated with the acquisition to restructuring expenses  which is a change in the required accounting in comparison to fiscal and fiscal see further discussion regarding certain of our restructuring plans in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

the income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented 
income tax effects were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the expense and income items within the table above and resulted in an effective tax rate of for fiscal instead of  which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations  due to differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in fiscal the difference in fiscal was also due to income tax effects related to acquired tax exposures 
income tax effects were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of for fiscal instead of  which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations  due to the exclusion of the tax effect of an adjustment to our non current deferred tax liability associated with acquired intangible assets

common stock repurchases our board of directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock 
on october   we announced that our board of directors expanded our repurchase program by billion and as of may   billion was available for share repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
we repurchased million shares for billion  million shares for billion  and million shares for billion in fiscal  and  respectively 
our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs  our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments  our debt repayment obligations described further below  our stock price  and economic and market conditions 
our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule b plan 
our stock repurchase program may be accelerated  suspended  delayed or discontinued at any time 
cash dividends in fiscal  we declared and paid cash dividends of per share that totaled billion  which is an increase in comparison to fiscal in which we declared and paid the first dividend in our history to our common stockholders of per share  which totaled million 
in june  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock payable on august  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on july  future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of 
table of contents our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of may  year ending may  dollars in millions total thereafter principal payments on short term borrowings and long term debt capital leases interest payments on short term borrowings and long term debt operating leases purchase obligations funding commitments total contractual obligations our borrowings excluding capital leases consist of the following as of may  principal balance commercial paper notes effective interest rate of senior notes due january  net of discount of senior notes due april senior notes due july  net of fair value adjustment of senior notes due january  net of discount of senior notes due april  net of discount of senior notes due july  net of discount of senior notes due april  net of discount of senior notes due july  net of discount of total borrowings we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements related to our july senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a libor based index 
interest payments on borrowings presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using an interest rate of  which represented our effective interest rate as of may  after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements  and are subject to change in future periods 
the changes in fair value of our debt associated with the interest rate risk that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements are included in notes payable and other non current borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of borrowings 
represents remaining payments under capital leases  substantially all of which were assumed from our acquisitions 
primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities 
we have approximately million in facility obligations  net of estimated sublease income  accrued restructuring for these locations in our consolidated balance sheet at may  represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable  legally binding and specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the payment 
as a result of our acquisition of sun  we utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for our products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products 
we also obtain individual components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead times and or commercially standard lead times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table 
routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in this amount as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way 
represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments  which are payable upon demand 

table of contents as of may   we have billion of unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately million of these liabilities these amounts have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when they might be settled 
although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made  some or all may be made in fiscal we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities  although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal separately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we agreed to acquire phase forward incorporated  a provider of applications for life sciences companies and healthcare providers  for per share in cash  amounting to approximately million 
our proposed acquisition of phase forward is subject to stockholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions 
in addition  we agreed to acquire certain other companies for amounts that are not material to our business 
we intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally available cash  our cash generated from operations  our existing available debt capacity  additional borrowings  or from the issuance of additional securities 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and contractual obligations 
in addition  we believe we could fund any future acquisitions  dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  our existing available debt capacity  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
selected quarterly financial data quarterly revenues  expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors  including sales force incentive compensation plans 
in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in europe during the summer 
these seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry 
these factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter  which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year 
similarly  the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues in particular  our new software license and hardware systems products businesses as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term 
we expect these trends to continue in fiscal our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating income were also impacted in the periods presented in the table below by our acquisition of sun during the third quarter of fiscal  which added a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results 
the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that all necessary adjustments  which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding

table of contents fiscal quarter ended unaudited in millions  except per share amounts august november february may revenues gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted stock options and restricted stock based awards our stock based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
we historically have granted only stock options to our employees 
the restricted stock based awards included in the table presented below were assumed as a result of acquisitions 
we recognize that options and restricted stock based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution since june  has been a weighted average annualized rate of per year 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options or restricted stock based awards granted and assumed  net of options and restricted stock based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company  divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised and restricted stock based awards vest 
some of the outstanding options  which generally have a year exercise period  have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock 
at may   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historical practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
in recent years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock based compensation program  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions  to pay dividends  to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes 
at may   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock option and restricted stock based awards  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was

recent accounting pronouncements for information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest income risk our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large  diverse financial institutions worldwide which we believe mitigates certain risks 
in addition  we purchase high quality debt security investments  substantially all with relatively short maturities see a description of our debt securities held in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources above 
therefore  interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments 
substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available for sale 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
for fiscal  total interest income was million with our investments yielding an average on a worldwide basis 
this interest rate level was down by basis points from for fiscal if overall interest rates fell by basis points from our average of 
table of contents during fiscal  our annual interest income would decline by approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels 
the table below presents the cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at may  the cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are recorded at their fair values at may  may  dollars in millions fair value weighted average interest rate cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense risk our total borrowings were billion as of may   all of which were fixed rate borrowings 
in september  we entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related debt fair value exposures associated with our billion of senior notes due july notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became variable based on libor 
we do not use interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
we have designated these swap agreements as qualifying instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to the fasb s accounting standard for derivatives and hedging 
these transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of our notes due to interest rate movements 
the changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements will be recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non current borrowings 
the periodic interest settlements  which occur at the same intervals as the notes  are recorded as interest expense 
by entering into these interest rate swap arrangements  we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor 
our notes had an effective interest rate of as of may   after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 
an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates 
as of may   if libor based interest rates increased by basis points  the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements 
in may  we repaid billion of floating rate senior notes and settled the variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement that was used to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations associated with such floating rate senior notes 
foreign currency risk foreign currency transaction risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and are subject to risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
we have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset these risks 
our program may be suspended from time to time 
this program was active for the majority of fiscal and was suspended during our fourth quarter of fiscal when the program is active  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions 
our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term 
although we have suspended our historical foreign currency forward contract program as of may   our subsidiaries continue to enter into cross currency transactions and create cross currency exposures via intercompany arrangements and we expect that these transactions and exposures will continue 
our ultimate 
table of contents realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transactions that we enter into  the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates  whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors 
historically  we have not used foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes and have not designated these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to asc accordingly  we have recorded the fair value of these historical contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to non operating income expense  net in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of may   we estimate that certain of our us dollar and euro functional subsidiaries have the equivalent of approximately billion and approximately million approximately million of net intercompany receivables whereby the amounts to be received by these subsidiaries are in currencies other than us dollars or euros  respectively  and are therefore subject to remeasurement as of each balance sheet date 
as of may   we have no financial instruments in place to mitigate the risks associated with these foreign currency exposures 
if overall foreign currency exchange rates weaken strengthen against both the us dollar and euro by  we estimate that we would incur approximately million of remeasurement losses gains in connection with these intercompany balances assuming the balances remained constant with those as of may  net foreign exchange transaction losses gains included in non operating income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal were foreign currency losses relating to our venezuelan subsidiary s operations  which are more thoroughly described under non operating income expense  net in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international  we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future  the amounts and timing of which may vary 
foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars 
in particular  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in us dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
periodically  we hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure and provide a discussion in foreign currency net investment risk below 
as the us dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in us dollars for these subsidiaries as of may  declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of may  as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows  the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in us dollars for fiscal  and was a decrease increase of million  million  and million  respectively 
the following table includes the us dollar equivalent of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of may  in millions us dollar equivalent at may  euro japanese yen chinese renminbi british pound indian rupee canadian dollar other foreign currencies total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies 
table of contents if overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar weakened by  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars would increase by approximately million  assuming constant foreign currency cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
foreign currency net investment risk periodically  we hedge net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our foreign currency based investments in these subsidiaries 
these contracts have been designated as net investment hedges pursuant to asc we entered into these net investment hedges for all of fiscal and the majority of fiscal we suspended this program during our fourth quarter of fiscal and  as of may   we have no contracts outstanding 
we used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges 
under this method for each reporting period  the change in fair value of the forward contracts attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates the effective portion was reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in fair value of the forward contract the ineffective portion  if any was recognized in non operating income expense  net  in our consolidated statement of operations 
we recorded settlements under these forward contracts in a similar manner 
the fair values of both the effective and ineffective portions were recorded to our consolidated balance sheet as prepaid expenses and other current assets for amounts receivable from the counterparties or other current liabilities for amounts payable to the counterparties 
net gains losses on our net investment hedges reported in stockholders equity  net of tax effects  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net gains on our net investment hedges reported in non operating income expense  net were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively
