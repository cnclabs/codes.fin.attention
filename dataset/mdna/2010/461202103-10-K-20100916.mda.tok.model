in fiscal we acquired homestead technologies inc and electronic clearing house  inc 
echo  in fiscal we acquired paycycle  inc  and in fiscal we acquired mint software inc and medfusion  inc 
we have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our intuit distribution management solutions and intuit real estate solutions businesses as discontinued operations 
see results of operations discontinued operations and dispositions later in this item for more information 
unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview of financial results total net revenue for fiscal was billion  an increase of compared with fiscal revenue was higher in all of our business segments 
consumer tax segment revenue increased million or due to growth in turbotax online units 
operating income from continuing operations increased in fiscal compared with fiscal cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue was slightly lower in fiscal due to unit growth in turbotax online units 
operating expenses increased due to incentive compensation that was directly related to our financial results and the addition of operating expenses for acquired businesses 
net income from continuing operations increased in fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately and our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately 
due to all of the foregoing factors  diluted net income per share from continuing operations of for fiscal grew compared with fiscal we ended fiscal with cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling billion 
in fiscal we generated cash from operations  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  and from the sale of our intuit real estate solutions business 
during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs  for net purchases of investments  for the acquisitions of mint and medfusion  and for capital expenditures 
at july   we had expended all funds authorized by our board of directors for stock repurchases 
on august  we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional billion of our common stock from time to time over a three year period ending on august  
table of contents seasonality our quickbooks  consumer tax and accounting professionals offerings are highly seasonal 
revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters 
sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
in our consumer tax business  a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online  for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january and third quarter ending april we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october and fourth quarter ending july  when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 
we believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  software subscriptions  product support  hosting services  payroll services  merchant services  professional services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see revenue recognition in note to the financial statements in item of this report 
we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
in connection with the sale of certain products  we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers 
we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant 
the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent 
we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 
return and rebate reserves as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the 
table of contents product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our total net revenue for fiscal would have been about million lower 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of these reserves  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
we had a total of million in gross accounts receivable on our balance sheet at july  fair value of investments as described in note to the financial statements in item of this report  we estimate the fair value of our available for sale securities each quarter 
these investments consist of cash equivalents  municipal bonds  us treasury securities  us agency securities  corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets  the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low 
this is generally true for our cash equivalents  which we consider to be level assets  and our municipal bonds  us agency securities and corporate notes  which we consider to be level assets 
however  significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available level 
for example  we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive 
we based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets  regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since february some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain 
the key inputs include projected future interest rates  the likely timing of principal repayments  the probability of full repayment  publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions  and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities 
at july   we held a total of million in municipal auction rate securities 
we record unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is other than temporary 
we consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the reason for the decrease in fair value  the severity of the decrease in fair value  the length of time that 
table of contents the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis 
changes in our estimates of the fair values of our available for sale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs 
fair value of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities we estimate the fair values of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that we do not recognize or disclose at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance 
these include nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test  and other nonfinancial assets or liabilities measured at fair value for impairment testing 
we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
given the nature of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently complex 
for example  if there are no known markets or we do not have access to any markets  we are required to identify hypothetical market participants and develop a hypothetical market based on the expected assumptions of those market participants 
in addition  we are required to consider and use all appropriate valuation methods 
using multiple valuation methods can yield a range of possible results  which we must evaluate in order to choose the most representative point within the range 
assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors 
changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates and record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets  or retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations 
these charges and adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
business combinations as described in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies business combinations  in item of this report  under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition 
we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred  which we also measure at fair value  over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition  including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  and contingencies 
this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date 
if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions  these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired technology  customer lists  and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could record impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 

table of contents goodwill  acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
as described in note to the financial statements in item of this report  in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model known as the income approach and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses known as the market approach 
the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions  including market factors specific to the business  the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time  long term growth rates for the business  and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions 
although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
when using the market approach  we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses 
we base our judgments on factors such as size  growth rates  profitability  risk  and return on investment 
we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue  operating income  and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses 
we had a total of billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july  see note to the financial statements in item of this report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment 
we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate 
in order to estimate the fair value of those assets  we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite lives 
we had a total of million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july  assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units  we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed our annual goodwill impairment test 
as described in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill  acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets  in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired 
consequently  we recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended july  during our fiscal goodwill impairment analysis  we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
the estimated fair value of our financial services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of billion by approximately  compared with approximately 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the course of estimating the fair value of our financial services reporting unit  we considered the extent to which it was consistently meeting or exceeding internal financial expectations and key business milestones  and the extent to which it was consistently meeting or exceeding the financial performance of similar lines of business within comparable companies 
the fiscal increase in fair value for this reporting unit was predominantly due to increases in revenue  operating income  and earnings multiples for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses  which are key inputs to the market approach analysis that we perform 
as discussed above  estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors 
the recent global economic downturn has caused significant disruptions in global financial markets and in the banking and financial services industry 
potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our financial institutions reporting unit include the consolidation or failure of financial institutions  which may result in a smaller market for our products and services and may cause us to lose relationships with key customers  and cost cutting efforts by financial institutions  which may cause us to lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer 
if the estimated fair value of our financial institutions reporting unit declines due to any of these factors  we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges 
accounting for share based compensation plans at july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of years 
we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note to the financial statements in item of this report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we amortize the fair value of options on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
restricted stock units rsus granted typically vest based on continued service 
we value these time based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and amortize those values on a straight line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period 
certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre established performance or market goals 
we estimate the fair value of performance based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met 
we amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award 
we estimate the fair value of market based rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award 
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount 
table of contents can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes estimates of deferred taxes  valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions 
we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 
at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million which included a valuation allowance of million for certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal and this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk 
the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks  we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest 
we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments 
while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks  such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control 
our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market funds  we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments 
the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities as of july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents  which consist primarily of money market funds 
at july   the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 
years ending july  and in millions thereafter total cash equivalents investments long term investments total interest rate risk our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments would decrease by approximately million 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments would decrease by approximately million 
we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our million revolving credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from to based on our senior debt credit ratings 
consequently  our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
on march  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due on march  and million of senior unsecured notes due on march  we carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets 
since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates  we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates 
however  the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change 
see note and note to the financial statements in part of this report for more information 

table of contents impact of foreign currency rate changes the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date 
we translate their revenue  costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period 
we include translation gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets 
we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 
since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars  british pounds  indian rupees and singapore dollars into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
