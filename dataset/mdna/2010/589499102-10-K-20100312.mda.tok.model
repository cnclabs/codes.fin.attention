management s discussion and analysis is presented in the following order overview revenues and expenses results of operations liquidity and capital resources material off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies overview we develop software solutions that automate healthcare data and diagnostic workflow to create a more comprehensive electronic record of the patient experience 
our products  ranging from standards based development toolkits to fully integrated clinical applications  have been used by healthcare providers worldwide for over years 
we have significantly expanded our product offerings in the second half of through strategic acquisitions 
on september   we completed the acquisition of confirma  inc confirma  a provider of computer systems for processing and presentation of data from magnetic resonance imaging mri studies 
under terms of the agreement  we acquired all the outstanding shares of confirma in exchange for million shares of merge common stock 
total consideration for the transaction was million 
upon completion of the acquisition  we renamed this entity merge cad 
on july   we completed the acquisition of etrials worldwide  inc etrials  a provider of clinical trials software and services 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of etrials for consideration per share of in cash  without interest  and shares of merge common stock 
total consideration for the transaction was million 
upon completion of the acquisition  we renamed this entity merge eclinical 
on june   we enhanced our financial reporting process to allow us to obtain discrete operating results for our business units 
as a result  effective in the third quarter of  we have reportable segments  which we have designated as direct and indirect 
these reportable segments are based on business unit operations that have similar economic characteristics 
the direct segment primarily sells directly to the end users located primarily in the us and canada  and also distributes certain products through the internet via our website 
this segment consists of the merge fusion us and merge eclinical business units 
the indirect segment primarily sells software products and related services to original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers and distributors world wide 
this segment consists of the merge oem  merge cad and merge fusion emea business units 
we have seen our markets become increasingly affected by the continuing global macroeconomic downturn 
the downturn  which first started in the us  has also impacted our customers in other parts of the world 
we believe that the initiatives undertaken to reduce our operating expenses have appropriately positioned our recurring cost structure 
we believe it is likely that this economic downturn will continue to persist  however  we cannot predict its severity  duration or impact on our future operating results 
we are also monitoring the increasing regulatory and legislative activity surrounding healthcare and health information technology as discussed more fully above 
due to the complexity of the reform legislation and its potential impact on us as both a vendor and employer  it is difficult to forecast any potential net impact on our customers and market  and thus we remain cautious about the impact on our business 

index we will attempt to use the current economic environment as an opportunity to expand our market share and to continue moving into similar  related  or adjacent markets to those in which we currently are active  as well as invest in international growth 
we continue to develop new products and are pleased with the breadth and depth of our product lines and service capabilities 
effective as of february   we entered into a merger agreement to acquire amicas 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we will commence to tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of amicas for consideration per share of in cash  without interest  which is expected to be approximately million 
we plan to finance the transaction with million of financing from morgan stanley senior funding  inc  with whom we have executed a definitive commitment letter  through the sale of high yield notes or a bridge financing  in addition to cash already available at the two companies and the issuance of preferred and common stock with respect to which we have received million of pre funded proceeds from investors 
although we have not entered into a formal pref erred stock agreement with these investors  we have signed commitment letters that provide the investors a commitment fee  the issuance of up to million shares of common stock subject to million of total proceeds being received and cumulative dividends at an anticipated rate of  among other negotiated terms 
we have placed million of the pre funded proceeds in escrow pursuant to the merger agreement and may be required to release the escrow under certain circumstances 
in connection with these transactions  we have already incurred and anticipate incurring significant costs related to the acquisition  debt offering and preferred stock 
we anticipate total costs of these transactions to be incurred by both parties  including a break up fee owed to a former potential acquiror of amicas  will approximate million 
the merger agreement contains certain conditions to our obligation to complete the tender offer  including a successful tender of appr oximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of amicas  antitrust clearance and other regulatory approvals

total software and other sales in were million  an increase of approximately million  or  from million in indirect sales increased million  primarily due to the fact that sales were negatively affected in because of customer concerns with our financial viability 
we believe that these concerns were largely alleviated with the financing transaction completed in june in addition  indirect sales  when compared to  include million of additional sales from eklin medical systems  inc eklin  resulting from a new agreement with this customer in the second quarter of in addition  net sales from merge cad were million in direct sales decreased million primarily as a result of the downturn in general macroeconomic conditions in north america and having fewer contracts with significant hardware components compared to in the future  we anticipate that the revenue recognized from software and other sales may vary significantly on a quarterly basis 
services and maintenance sales 
total services and maintenance sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in direct sales increased million primarily due to million of sales by merge eclinical from the date of its acquisition 
indirect sales decreased million due to a decline in the number of custom engineering services projects in  primarily as a result of the reluctance of oem customers to start new projects in the current economic environment and a shift in our strategic focus with respect to such customers 
indirect services and maintenance sales in include million from merge cad from the date of its acquisition 
gross margin gross margin software and other sales 
gross margin on software and other sales was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of software and other sales increased to in from in  primarily due to the mix of sales by our segments 
indirect sales  which typically consist of software only or minimal hardware component contracts that generate higher margins  were of software and other sales in compared to in in addition  the hardware component of direct sales decreased to of sales in compared to in we expect our gross margin on sof tware and other sales going forward to fluctuate depending on the mix of sales between the segments and the percentage of hardware components included in sales through the direct segment 
gross margin services and maintenance sales 
gross margin on services and maintenance sales was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in primarily due to a decrease in salaries and other related expenses including travel and entertainment as a result of our restructuring initiatives

merrick and its affiliates owned approximately of our common stock as of december  in  we sold for cash proceeds of million certain patents that had been identified as no longer necessary to support the business 
on july   we completed the acquisition of etrials 
total consideration for the transaction was approximately million of which approximately million was cash 
under the terms of the merger agreement with amicas  we will acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of amicas for consideration per share of in cash  without interest  or approximately million 
we plan to finance the acquisition with either the sale of high yield notes or a bridge financing 
in addition  we anticipate total costs of the acquisition and related debt and preferred stock issued to be incurred by both parties  including a break up fee owed to a former potential acquirer of amicas  will approximate million 
operating cash flows cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in our negative operating cash flow in was primarily due to the impact of non cash charges of million  being more than offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million decrease in accounts payable  a million decrease in deferred revenue and a million decrease in accrued wages

except for million of restricted cash primarily letters of credit related to three of our leased facilities at december   we do not have any other significant long term obligations  contractual obligations  lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees or standby repurchase obligations 
general we believe our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months  except that we will need to issue at least million of debt and equity in order to finance our acquisition of amicas 
any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in the event that it is necessary to raise additional capital to meet our short term or long term liquidity needs  such capital may be raised through additional debt  equity offerings or sale of certain assets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
furthermore  because of the l ow trading price of our common stock  the number of shares of any new equity or equity related securities that may be issued may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  the issuance of debt securities could increase the liquidity risk or perceived liquidity risk that we face 
we cannot  however  be certain that additional financing  or funds from asset sales  will be available on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we will likely not be able to take advantage of opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in particular  our uses of cash in and beyond will depend on a variety of factors such as the costs to implement our business strategy  the amount of cash that we are required to devote to defend and address any regulatory proceedings  and potential merger and acquisition activities 
for a more detailed description of risks and uncertainties that may affect our liquidity  see item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
material off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates  judgments  and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience  our current knowledge including terms of existing contracts  our beliefs of what could occur in the future  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  other long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  investments  share based compensation expense  income taxes  guarantees and loss contingencies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived primarily from the licensing of software  sales of hardware and related ancillary products  saas offerings  installation and engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and support 
inherent to software revenue recognition are significant management estimates and judgments in the interpretation and practical application of the complex rules to individual contracts 
these interpretations generally would not influence the amount of revenue recognized  but could influence the timing of such revenues 
in addition  revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
signi ficant areas of judgment include the determination of deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement and treatment as separate units of accounting  
index whether separate arrangements with the same customer executed within a short time frame of each other are a single arrangement  the assessment of the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer since we generally do not request collateral from customers  the determination of whether the fees are fixed and determinable  whether or not installation  engineering or consulting services are significant to the software licensed  and the amount of total estimated labor hours  based on management s best estimate  to complete a project we account for under the input method of percentage of completion accounting 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated labor hours  and reflect changes in estimates in the period that such estimates are revised under the cumulative catch up method 
typically  our contracts contain multiple elements  and while the majority of our contracts contain standard terms and conditions  there are instances where our contracts contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
as a result  if facts and circumstances change that affect our current judgments  our revenue could be mater ially different in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns based upon past experience and judgment  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts related to our accounts receivable and customer credits with respect to our sales returns 
we determine collection risk and record allowances for bad debts based on the aging of accounts and past transaction history with customers 
in addition  our policy is to allow sales returns when we have preauthorized the return 
we have determined an allowance for estimated returns and credits based on our historical experience of returns and customer credits 
we monitor our collections  write offs  returns and credit experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our receivables or modific ations to our credit standards  collection  return and credit  authorization practices or other related policies may impact our estimates 
other long lived assets other long lived assets  including property and equipment and customer intangibles  are amortized over their expected lives  which are estimated by us 
for our customer intangibles  the method of amortization we use reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  a straight line amortization method is used 
we also make estimates of the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the asset s recovery 
if the actual useful life of a long lived asset is shorter than the useful life estimated by us  the asset may be deemed to be impaired  and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset determined by a discounted cash flow analysis  or a shorter amortization period  may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
our policy provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment as of october st or december st of each year  depending on the reporting unit in which the assets reside 
in calculating potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets using either quoted market prices or  if not available  by estimating the expected present value of their future cash flows 
identification of  and assignment of assets and liabilities to  a reporting unit require our judgment and estimates 
in addition  future cash flows are based upon our assumptions about future sales activity and market acceptance of our products 
if these assumptions change  we may be required to write down the gross value of our remaining indefinite lived intangible assets to a revised amount 

index investments we hold certain securities in a publicly traded entity and private companies  which are classified as non current assets 
in determining fair value for these investments  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  to the extent possible 
the investment in the publicly traded equity security  over which we do not exert significant influence  is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are based on changes in quoted market prices and reported within the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
the investments in equity securities of private companies  over which we do not exert significant influence  are reported at cost or fair value  if an other than temporary loss has been determined 
in calculating the potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of investments by comparing them to certain public company metrics such as revenue multiples  information obtained from independent valuations  and inquires and estimates made by us 
if assumptions or estimates used by us change  we may be required to write down the carrying value of the asset to a revised amount 
any loss due to impairment in value is recorded when such loss occurs 
share based compensation expense we calculate share based compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of stock based awards is based on certain assumptions  including expected volatility  which we base on the historical volatility of our stock and other factors  and estimated option life  which represents the period of time the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based  in part  on historical data 
we also estimate employee terminations option forfeiture rate  which is based  in part  on historical data  employee class and the type of award 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and restricted stock awards on a quarterly basis 
the estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share based compensation expense are reasonable  these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events  which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty 
in addition  significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes 
a current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
changes in valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through translation  in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted 
where a valuation allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets  any future change outside the measurement period will be credited or charged to income tax expense 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns  we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
we determine the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recognized wit h respect to uncertain tax positions 
unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based upon new information  resolution with taxing authorities and expiration of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes in the liability for our uncertain tax positions 
although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty  therefore  our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities 

index guarantees we recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by us  as applicable 
in addition  we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred  then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications 
under our standard software license agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless our licensees from and against certain losses  damages and costs arising from claims alleging the licensees use of our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  we have not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions  and  accordingly  we have not recorded a liability relating to such provisions 
we also represent and warrant to licensees that our software products will operate substantially in accordance with published specifications  and that the services we perform will be undertaken by qualified personnel in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices 
historically  only minimal costs have been incurred relating to the satisfaction of product warranty claims 
other guarantees include promises to indemnify  defend and hold harmless each of our executive officers  non employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses  damages and costs incurred by each such individual in administrative  legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on our behalf 
loss contingencies we have accrued for costs as of december  and may  in the future  accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
recent accounting pronouncements we describe below recent pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents included money market funds and short term deposits  including certain cash that is restricted  totaling approximately million  and earned interest at a weighted average rate of in the value of the principal amounts is equal to the fair value for these instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  our interest income is subject to changes in short term interest rates 
at current investment levels  our pre tax results of operations would vary by approximately million for every basis point change in our weighted average short term interest rate 
we do not use our portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we have sales and expenses in canada  china and europe that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and  as a result  have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases to levels that we do not deem acceptable  we may choose to hedge those exposures
