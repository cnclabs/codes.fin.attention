in september  wpl revised its request to an annual electric retail rate increase of million and annual retail natural gas rate increase of million 
the increase in the requested amount for the retail electric rates was primarily due to increased infrastructure costs and a reduced sales forecast 
in december  wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing an annual retail electric rate increase of million  or approximately  and an annual retail natural gas rate increase of million  or approximately  effective january the pscw order included the following details return on common equity of regulatory capital structure comprised of common equity  long term debt  short term debt and preferred equity weighted average cost of capital of average rate base of billion for retail electric and billion for retail natural gas 
the december order from the pscw also approved recovery of certain deferred benefits costs incurred by wpl in and a portion of the previously deferred costs for the cancelled nelson dewey project 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements and alliant energy s results of operations for further discussion regarding the pscw s decision regarding recovery of these deferred costs and regulatory related charges in for the portion of the cancelled nelson dewey costs that wpl was denied recovery 
the retail electric rate relief approved by the pscw includes an amount that represents a current return on of the estimated cwip for wpl s bent tree phase i wind project for the remaining cwip balance for its bent tree phase i wind project will accrue afudc during in addition  the pscw authorized wpl to defer the retail portion of return on rate base  depreciation expense and other operation and maintenance expenses for those portions of the bent tree phase i wind project placed in service in wpl s retail rate case test period in february  wpl filed a request with the pscw to increase current retail electric rates by million  or approximately  and reduce current retail gas rates by million  or approximately  effective jan 
 the electric request was based on a forward looking test year with approval to reopen the case to address limited cost drivers for the electric request reflected recovery for increased projected spending on electric generation infrastructure  environmental compliance and stewardship  enhanced investment in renewable energy projects  stepped up customer energy efficiency and conservation efforts  and related electric transmission and distribution costs 
the gas request was based on an average of and projected costs 
through the course of the pscw audit  the request was updated for various new cost estimates and removal of capital projects that had not yet been approved by the pscw 
these projects include bent tree phase i  nelson dewey subsequently rejected by the pscw in december and various environmental compliance projects 
wpl received approval from the pscw for the bent tree phase i wind project in  and it was subsequently included in wpl s retail rate case 
in december  wpl and major intervenors in the case reached a stipulated agreement on electric and gas rate changes for the parties agreed to hold retail electric rates flat and decrease retail gas rates by million 
the stipulated agreement also included a provision that authorized wpl to defer  and record carrying costs on  the retail portion of pension and benefit costs in excess of million  any change in the retail portion of network wheeling costs charged by atc that is different than the million included in rates and any change in the retail portion of emission allowance expense that is different than million 
in addition  the stipulated agreement included the recovery of million over a two year period for pre certification costs related to the nelson dewey project that had been incurred through december the pscw approved the stipulations in december wpl s retail rate case test year in april  wpl filed a request with the pscw to reopen its retail rate case for the limited purpose of increasing electric retail rates in an amount equal to deferral credits that were fully amortized on dec 
 wpl also requested clarification that it is authorized to record afudc on all cwip balances in excess of the cwip balance included in the test year 
in november  the pscw issued a final written order approving an annual electric retail rate increase of million effective jan 
 and approving wpl s requested clarification regarding afudc and cwip 
ipl s iowa retail rate case test year in march  ipl filed a request with the iub to increase annual electric rates for its iowa retail customers by million  or approximately 
the filing was based on a historical test year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to months after the commencement of the proceeding 
the key drivers for the filing included recovery of increased costs and capital investments since ipl s last iowa electric retail rate case filed in these increased costs and capital investments included increased costs for electric transmission service  infrastructure investments completed during the past five years to enhance the reliability of ipl s electric system and lower emissions at its generating facilities  increased costs for pension and other employee benefits  capital investments and operating expenses incurred by ipl to restore electric service following winter ice storms and severe flooding that impacted its iowa electric service territory  and capital expenditures for the cancelled sutherland project 
in september  ipl revised this request to seek an increase of million  or approximately 
the decrease in the requested amount was primarily due to an alternative cost recovery process for the capitalized expenditures for sutherland discussed below and an alternative method five year average for calculating the annual recovery amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
in january  ipl received an order from the iub authorizing a final annual retail electric rate increase of million  or approximately  plus the use of a portion of ipl s regulatory liabilities to offset costs related to the cancelled sutherland project and future electric transmission service costs 
the iub order included the following details return on common equity of for all non emery generating station related capital emery generating station related capital has a previously approved return on common equity of regulatory capital structure comprised of common equity  long term debt and preferred equity weighted average cost of capital of for all non emery generating station related capital average rate base of billion for retail electric 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the iub s decision in its january order to allow ipl to recover million of flood related costs incurred in and to use regulatory liabilities to offset the recovery of million of costs incurred for the cancelled sutherland base load project and million of transmission costs expected to be billed to ipl in related to itc midwest llc s itc s transmission revenue true up adjustment 
planned utility rate cases in ipl expects to file an iowa retail electric rate case in march based on a historical test period 
the key drivers for the filing include recovery of investments in the whispering willow east wind project and emission control projects at lansing unit and recovery of increased electric transmission service costs 
any rate changes are expected to be implemented in two phases with interim rates effective approximately days after the filing and final rates effective approximately months after the march filing date 
ipl also anticipates filing a retail electric rate case in minnesota in the second quarter of any rate changes in minnesota are currently expected to be implemented in two phases with interim rates effective approximately two months after the filing and final rates effective approximately months after the filing date 
wpl expects to file a retail electric and gas rate case in march based on a forward looking test period that includes and the key drivers for the filing include recovery of investments in wpl s bent tree phase i wind project and other infrastructure projects 
any rate changes granted are expected to be effective on jan 
  which is the start of the test year period 
other utility rate case information with the exception of recovering a return on additions to ipl s and wpl s infrastructure  a significant portion of the rate increases included in the above table reflect a recovery of increased costs incurred or expected to be incurred by ipl and wpl and the impact of lower sales 
thus  increases in revenues from rate increases cannot be expected to result in an equal increase in income before income taxes to either ipl or wpl  as applicable 
retail fuel related rate filings details of wpl s retail fuel related rate filings impacting its historical results of operations are as follows test year in august  wpl notified the pscw that its actual retail fuel related costs incurred during the month of july were below the monthly monitoring range of plus or minus and projected annual retail fuel related costs for could fall outside the annual monitoring range of plus or minus 
in september  the pscw issued an order that set wpl s retail electric fuel rates currently in effect subject to refund beginning sep 
 in january  wpl filed a retail electric fuel refund report indicating retail fuel over collections of million for the period from sep 
 through dec 
 as of dec 
  wpl reserved million  including interest  for refunds anticipated to be paid to its retail electric customers 
wpl currently expects to receive the pscw s decision and complete any refunds to its retail electric customers in the second quarter of test year in march  wpl filed a request with the pscw to increase annual retail electric rates by million to recover anticipated increased electric production fuel and energy purchases fuel related costs 
actual fuel related costs through february  combined with projections of continued higher fuel related costs for the remainder of  significantly exceeded the amounts being recovered in retail electric rates at the time of the filing 
in the second quarter of  wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing the requested million interim increase  subject to refund  effective in april retail fuel related costs incurred by wpl in were lower than retail fuel related costs used to determine interim rates that were effective april  resulting in million  including interest  of refunds owed to its retail electric customers 
wpl refunded the million to its retail electric customers in test year in may  wpl notified the pscw that its actual average fuel related costs for the month of march had fallen below the monthly fuel monitoring range set in wpl s most recent retail rate case and that projected average fuel related costs for could be below the annual monitoring range to an extent that would warrant a decrease in retail electric rates 
in june  the pscw issued an order that set wpl s retail electric rates currently in effect subject to refund beginning june  retail fuel related costs incurred by wpl for the period from june  to dec 
 were lower than retail fuel related costs used to determine rates during such period resulting in million  including interest  of refunds owed to its retail electric customers 
wpl completed these refunds by reimbursing its retail electric customers million in  million in and million in refer to b

wpl s wholesale rate filing in december  wpl received an order from ferc authorizing an interim rate increase  subject to refund  effective june  related to wpl s request to implement a formula rate structure for its wholesale electric customers 
in february  final written agreements were filed with ferc that contained a settlement between wpl and its wholesale customers of the issues identified in wpl s filing requesting the formula rate structure 
in august  ferc approved the settlement and the implementation of settlement rates effective june  during the period the interim rate increase was effective from june  to may   wpl over recovered million  including interest  from its wholesale customers 
in september  wpl refunded the million to its wholesale electric customers 
authorized return on equity at dec 
  ipl s and wpl s most recently authorized return on common equity for each of its key jurisdictions were as follows authorized authorized return on return on ipl s jurisdictions common equity wpl s jurisdictions common equity iowa retail iub wisconsin retail pscw electric emery generating station electric electric whispering willow east gas electric other wholesale ferc gas electric minnesota retail mpuc electric gas proposed changes to rate recovery mechanisms ipl s iowa transmission rider in  ipl filed a proposal with the iub to implement an automatic cost recovery rider for annual changes in electric transmission service costs 
the proposed automatic cost recovery rider would not require a base rate case for annual revisions of rates charged to ipl s iowa retail electric customers  but would require that the electric transmission service costs incurred be fully reconciled against the revenues collected for such costs 
in its january order  the iub deferred the decision on ipl s proposal to ipl s next filed rate case 
ipl s minnesota transmission rider in january  ipl filed a proposal with the mpuc to implement an automatic cost recovery rider for annual changes in electric transmission service costs 
the proposed automatic cost recovery rider would not require a base rate case for annual revisions of rates charged to ipl s minnesota retail electric customers  but would require that the electric transmission service costs incurred be fully reconciled against the revenues collected for such costs 
ipl is currently unable to determine when the mpuc will take action on this request 
wpl s wholesale formula rate change in august  wpl filed a request with ferc requesting approval of changes to wpl s wholesale formula rates in order to implement for billing purposes the full impact of accounting for defined benefit postretirement plans 
in october  wpl wholesale customers requested that ferc suspend the august filing and set up an evidentiary hearing to be held pending the outcome of settlement discussions 
electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism in wisconsin in november  legislation assembly bill was introduced in wisconsin to change statutes related to the process by which utilities recover electric fuel related costs from their retail electric customers 
if approved  the new electric fuel related costs recovery mechanism would allow wisconsin utilities to automatically defer electric fuel related costs that fall outside a symmetrical cost tolerance band and reflect the over under recovery of these deferred costs in future billings to its retail customers 
this change would eliminate the current regulatory lag between the point in time fuel related costs fall outside tolerance bands and the point in time when new rates are placed into effect 
the pscw supports this legislation 
in february  the wisconsin assembly approved the assembly bill however  alliant energy and wpl are unable to predict whether the legislation will be enacted 
environmental matters overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by federal  state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl monitor these environmental matters and address them with pollution abatement programs 
these programs are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors  including changes in environmental regulations  litigation of environmental requirements  construction plans and compliance costs 
there is currently significant regulatory uncertainty with respect to the various environmental rules and regulations discussed below 
given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements  ipl and wpl have established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental compliance of their future anticipated operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate future expenditures for environmental compliance will be material including significant capital investments 
alliant energy anticipates that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from its customers 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans for details of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s environmental compliance plans  including estimated capital expenditures 
the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
air quality the clean air act caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
as part of the basic framework under the caa  the epa is required to establish naaqs  which serve to protect public health and welfare 
these standards address six criteria pollutants  four of which are particularly relevant to alliant energy s electric utility operations  including nox  so  particulate matter pm  and ozone 
ozone is not directly emitted from alliant energy s generating facilities  however  nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere 
fine particulate matter pm may also be formed in the atmosphere from so and nox emissions 
state implementation plans sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs and related caa requirements 
the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules  then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan fip 
areas that comply with naaqs are considered to be in attainment  whereas routinely monitored locations that do not comply with these standards may be classified by the epa as non attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions 
additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond the naaqs 
the specific federal and state regulations that may affect alliant energy s operations include cair  clean air visibility rule cavr  wisconsin state mercury rule  wisconsin ract rule  mact standards and naaqs rules 
alliant energy also monitors various other potential environmental matters related to air quality  including litigation of various federal rules issued under the caa statutory authority  revisions to the new source review prevention of significant deterioration psd permitting programs and new source performance standards  and proposed legislation or other regulatory actions to regulate the emission of ghg 
cair cair was issued by the epa in to reduce emissions of so and nox from electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity 
cair established new so and nox both annual and ozone season emission caps beginning in and  respectively  with further reductions in so and nox emission caps effective in cair included a large regional cap and trade system  where compliance may be achieved by either adding emission controls and or purchasing emission allowances 
in july  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit dc circuit court vacated cair in its entirety 
in september  the epa and other affected parties filed petitions requesting the dc circuit court review this decision  including a request that cair be remanded to the epa for reconsideration and not vacated in its entirety 
in december  the dc circuit court issued an order that denied rehearing of the original court decision and also remanded rather than vacated cair to the epa for revision to address flaws identified in the july opinion in the case 
the impact of the court s remand of cair to the epa is that cair obligations became effective jan 
 the epa has indicated that a revised cair proposal is expected to be issued by may and the final revised rule is expected to be issued to months later 
the court ruling may have an indirect impact on the cavr issued by the epa in and related best available retrofit technology rule bart determination guidance in to address regional haze as discussed below 
the epa s response to this court decision and associated implications to ipl and wpl are uncertain at this time 
there are also uncertainties regarding the state regulations in iowa and wisconsin that were adopted to implement cair and state responses when a federal cair replacement rule is finalized by the epa 
in november  the epa took final action to address one issue under cair related to the inclusion of minnesota in the cair program 
at issue were claims that the epa had included minnesota in the cair region based on inaccurate data and that use of better data would result in minnesota falling below the threshold impact level 
consistent with the court ruling  the epa issued a final rule staying the application of the cair annual so and nox programs for minnesota 
the final rule retired the annual nox emission allowances allocated to owners of minnesota generating facilities 
the epa s cair replacement rule will further assess whether or not minnesota will be included in the future as part of the cair region based on revised thresholds 
ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the epa s further work on a replacement rule for cair  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from the replacement air quality rules that address so and nox emissions could be significant 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to implement their environmental compliance plans to meet the currently effective cair requirements  which include investments in emission controls for electric generating facilities as well as purchases of emission allowances 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl will closely monitor future developments relating to the cair regulations and update their environmental compliance plans as needed 
cavr cavr requires states to develop and implement sips to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country with a national goal of no impairment by affected states including iowa  wisconsin and minnesota were required to submit a cavr sip to the epa by december to include bart emission controls and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze 
iowa submitted its regional haze sip for epa review and approval in march minnesota and wisconsin have not yet submitted a cavr sip for epa review 
in january  the epa found both minnesota and wisconsin to be deficient regarding the cavr sip submittal 
the epa is now required to promulgate a fip within two years 
however  the fip requirement is void if a state submits a regional haze sip  and the epa approves that sip within the two year period 
electric generating facility emissions of primary concern for bart and regional haze regulation include so  nox and pm 
there are pending obligations under the epa s cavr to complete bart determinations that would evaluate control options to reduce these emissions at certain wpl and ipl units that were built between and the dc circuit court cair ruling in may have an indirect impact on the cavr and bart sip implementation approach because the epa allowed for bart obligations for so and nox emissions to be fulfilled by the cair program 
as a result of the dc circuit court cair ruling in december to revise cair  there are uncertainties in the applicability of and compliance outcomes of bart control approaches that will be approved for inclusion in cavr sips 
in addition  there are uncertainties whether additional emission reductions could be required to address regional haze impacts beyond bart 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict the impact that cavr might have on the operations of existing electric generating facilities until epa final approval of state cavr plans  which is currently expected in utility mact standard in february  the epa filed a motion to dismiss its request for review of the dc circuit court s decision vacating the clean air mercury rule 
according to the motion to dismiss  the epa intends to develop mact standards for electric generating units pursuant to section of the caa 
when developing a mact standard  the epa looks at the current level of emissions control achieved by best performing similar sources 
these emissions control levels set a baseline  often referred to as the mact floor for the new standard 
in january  the epa issued an information collection request for coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units over mw in order to develop a proposed utility mact standard for the control of mercury and other federal hazardous air pollutants 
the purpose of the proposed information collection request is to collect data necessary to identify affected categories of electric generation units that will be subject to a utility mact standard and to define the mact floor 
the epa is currently negotiating a consent decree that could require the agency to propose utility mact standards for coal and oil fired electric generating units no later than march and promulgate final standards no later than november alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of utility mact standards to regulate mercury and other federal hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units  but expect that capital investments and or modifications could be significant to comply with any such regulations 
wisconsin state mercury rule in december  a state only mercury emission control rule became effective  which requires electric utility companies in wisconsin to reduce annual mercury emissions by from a historic baseline beginning in as part of its environmental compliance plan  wpl has invested in emission control technologies to meet the compliance requirements 
in addition  the wisconsin state mercury rule requires large coal fired electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity to either achieve a annual mercury emissions reduction standard or limit the annual concentration of mercury emissions to pounds of mercury per gigawatt hour beginning in there is also an alternative multi pollutant option that extends the time for compliance with the annual mercury reduction requirement until  but in addition requires the affected facilities to achieve nox and so reductions beyond those currently required by federal and state regulations 
other coal fired electric generating units between mw and mw of capacity must install bact by jan 
 to reduce mercury emissions 
wpl is planning additional investments in emission controls to meet the post compliance requirements 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans wpl s emission control projects for discussion of these proposed wpl emission controls 
wpl continues to evaluate the impact of this state mercury rule and the federal utility mact rule discussed above to determine further mercury emission reductions that will be required 
wisconsin ract rule in  the epa designated counties in southeastern wisconsin as non attainment areas for the ozone naaqs 
this designation includes sheboygan county  where wpl operates the sheboygan falls energy facility sfef and edgewater 
in  the wisconsin dnr issued a ract rule that requires nox emission reductions at electric generating facilities as part of the federal ozone sip submittal to address non attainment areas in wisconsin 
facility modifications are not necessary at sfef to comply with this rule 
as part of its environmental compliance plan  wpl completed investments for installation of nox emission control technologies at edgewater to meet the to compliance requirements 
refer to strategic overview environmental compliance plans wpl s emission control projects for discussion of proposed emission controls for further nox emission reductions at edgewater unit to meet compliance deadlines 
ozone naaqs rule in march  the epa announced reductions in the primary naaqs for eight hour ozone to a level of parts per million ppm from the previous standard of ppm 
a court has challenged that this new standard is not stringent enough 
in january  the epa issued a proposal to reduce the primary standard to a level within the range of to ppm and establish a new seasonal secondary standard 
the final rule is expected to be issued by august and final designations of non attainment areas are expected to be issued by august depending on the level and location of non attainment areas  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may be subject to additional nox emissions reduction requirements to meet the new ozone standard 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential changes to these ozone standards on their financial condition and results of operations 
fine particle naaqs rule the epa lowered the hour fine particle primary naaqs pm naaqs from micrograms per cubic meter ug m to ug m in in october  the epa announced final designation of pm non attainment areas 
ipl and wpl do not have any generating facilities in these non attainment areas 
however  in february  the dc circuit court of appeals issued a decision for litigation regarding the epa s determination not to lower the annual pm naaqs in in response to the litigation decision  the epa must re evaluate its justification for not tightening the annual standard related to adverse effects on health and visibility 
if the annual pm standard becomes more stringent  it could require so and nox emission reductions in areas designated as non attainment 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the potential impact of the pm naaqs re evaluation on their financial condition and results of operations 
no naaqs rule in january  the epa issued a final rule to strengthen the primary naaqs for nox as measured by no the final rule establishes a new one hour no standard of parts per billion ppb and associated ambient air monitoring requirements  while maintaining the current annual standard of ppb 
the epa is expected to designate non attainment areas for the new no standard by january alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential no standard changes on their financial condition or results of operations 
so naaqs rule in december  the epa published a proposed rule that would establish a new one hour naaqs for so and associated monitoring requirements 
the proposed rule would revise the primary so standard to a level of between and ppb measured over one hour 
the epa anticipates that a new one hour standard in the proposed range would prevent so concentrations from exceeding the current hour and annual health based standards 
as a result  the epa is proposing to revoke both of the current primary so standards 
alternatively  the epa is seeking comment on a one hour standard of ppb  which would supplement the existing standards 
the epa is under a court order to issue a final so standard by june and is expected to designate non attainment areas by june alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential so standard changes on their financial condition or results of operations 
industrial boiler and process heater mact rule the epa s industrial boiler and process heater mact rule became effective in and compliance with these new emission requirements for hazardous air pollutants was required by september this rule applies to fossil fuel electric generating units with less than mw capacity as well as certain auxiliary boilers and process heaters operated at electric generating facilities 
in june  a court decision vacated this rule 
the epa will be revising the industrial boiler and process heater mact rule by april in response to this court decision  and the implications to ipl and wpl are uncertain at this time 
until the epa issues a revised industrial boiler and process heater mact rule  the federal caa generally requires affected facilities to submit to state permitting authorities an application for a case by case mact determination for all potentially affected units under this rule 
case by case mact determinations are effective compliance measures until revised final federal regulations can replace these interim requirements 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl submitted case by case permit application information in the outcome of the case by case mact determinations by the iowa dnr and wisconsin dnr are uncertain at this time 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of any potential industrial boiler and process heater mact standard changes on their financial condition or results of operations and continue to monitor related regulatory developments 
air permit renewals wpl is aware of certain public comments or petitions from citizen groups that have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr or to the epa regarding the renewal of air operating permits at certain of its facilities 
wpl has since received renewal air permits for edgewater and columbia  which considered all public comments and contain changes to permit requirements that resulted from the wisconsin dnr s review process 
in december  the sierra club submitted a notice of intent to sue the epa for failure to respond to its petition encouraging the epa to challenge the air permit issued by the wisconsin dnr for columbia 
in october  the epa responded to the sierra club petition and granted one of three issues from the sierra club petition  objecting to that portion of the permit issued by the wisconsin dnr 
the wisconsin dnr has been working with epa  and has been in contact with wpl  related to this matter 
to date  no changes have been made to the previously issued permit for columbia 
in october  the sierra club petitioned the epa to object to a proposed title v air permit for edgewater that the wisconsin dnr had submitted to the epa for review 
the epa had days from the filing of the petition to respond 
in october  the wisconsin dnr issued the title v air permit renewal for edgewater  responding to comments made by the sierra club  which were the foundation for the petition 
in december  the sierra club filed a notice of intent to sue the epa over its failure to act on the petition 
the epa has not yet acted on the petition  and wpl cannot predict the outcome of the epa s response to the sierra club petition or the sierra club s notice of intent to sue the epa for failure to act on the petition 
air permitting violation claims in october  wpl  as an owner and the operator of nelson dewey and columbia  received from sierra club an noi based on allegations that modifications were made at those facilities without complying with the psd program requirements  title v operating permit requirements of the caa and state regulatory counterparts contained within the wisconsin sip designed to implement the caa 
in december  wpl received from sierra club a separate noi  which contained similar allegations regarding edgewater 
the nois allege that various projects performed at nelson dewey  columbia and edgewater in years past were major modifications  as defined in the caa  and that the owners violated the caa when they undertook those projects without obtaining permits and installing the best available emission controls for so  nox and pm 
in the edgewater noi  additional allegations were made regarding violations of emission limits for visible emissions 
in december  the epa sent an nov to wpl as an owner and the operator of nelson dewey  columbia and edgewater 
the nov alleges that the owners failed to comply with appropriate pre construction review and permitting requirements and as a result violated the psd program requirements  title v operating permit requirements of the caa and the sip 
if pursued successfully by the epa and or the sierra club  these actions could result in civil penalties in amounts of up to  per day for each violation and or injunctive relief to require installation of pollution control technology at nelson dewey  columbia and edgewater  which would increase future capital and operating expenditures of alliant energy and wpl 
alliant energy and wpl are currently reviewing the allegations and are unable to predict the impact of the allegations on their financial conditions or results of operations  but believe that an adverse outcome could be significant 
wpl and the other owners of columbia and edgewater are exploring settlement options with each of the epa and sierra club while simultaneously defending against these actions 
wpl believes the projects at nelson dewey  columbia and edgewater were routine or not projected to increase emissions therefore did not violate the permitting requirements of the caa 
water quality section b of federal clean water act the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
the second phase of this epa rule became effective in and is generally referred to as section b 
section b applies to existing cooling water intake structures at large steam electric generating facilities 
in  a court opinion invalidated aspects of the section b  which allowed for consideration of cost effectiveness when determining the appropriate compliance measures 
as a result  the epa formally suspended section b in in april  the us supreme court granted the epa authority to use a cost benefit analysis when setting technology based requirements under section b 
a revised section b rule reflecting the us supreme court s decision is anticipated to be proposed by the epa in and a final rule is expected in ipl and wpl have identified seven and three generating facilities  respectively  which may be impacted by the revised section b rule 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final requirements from section b  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from the rule could be significant 
wisconsin state thermal rule in january  the wisconsin natural resources board adopted a revised thermal rule proposal for regulating the amount of heat that facilities can discharge into wisconsin waters 
the rule must now be approved by the epa and is anticipated to be effective in the first half of compliance with the thermal rule will be evaluated on a case by case basis as discharge permits for wpl s generating facilities are renewed 
wpl continues to evaluate the thermal rule regulatory requirements and the compliance options available to meet the heat limitations for its generating facility discharges into wisconsin waters 
wpl is unable to predict the final requirements of this rule until discharge permits for the impacted facilities are renewed  however  should capital investments and or modifications be required  wpl believes these investments could be significant 
hydroelectric fish passages and fish protective devices in  ferc issued an order requiring the following actions regarding wpl s prairie due sac hydroelectric generating facility develop a detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages for the facility within months  install an agency approved fish protective device at the facility within months  and install an agency approved fish passage at the facility within three years 
the due dates for designing the potential fish passages and installing the fish protective device were extended to june   and the due date for installing the fish passage was extended to dec 
 in december  wpl completed the installation of an agency approved fish protection device at its prairie du sac facility as required by ferc 
alliant energy continues to work with the agencies to design and install the fish passage 
alliant energy and wpl believe the required capital investments and or modification to comply with the ferc order for the fish passage at its prairie du sac facility could be significant 
land and solid waste manufactured gas plant mgp sites ipl and wpl have current or previous ownership interests in and mgp sites  respectively  previously associated with the production of gas for which they may be liable for investigation  remediation and monitoring costs relating to the sites 
ipl and wpl are working pursuant to the requirements of federal and state agencies to investigate  mitigate  prevent and remediate  where necessary  the environmental impacts to property  including natural resources  at and around the sites in order to protect public health and the environment 
refer to note e of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for estimates of the range of remaining costs to be incurred for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of ipl s and wpl s mgp sites 
coal combustion by products ccb alliant energy  ipl and wpl are monitoring potential regulatory changes that may affect the rules for operation and maintenance of active ash ponds and or landfills  in the wake of an ash pond containment berm failure at a different utility 
in  ipl and wpl responded to information collection requests from the epa for data on coal ash surface impoundments at ten and four of their facilities  respectively 
the epa is evaluating the responses and has indicated its intent to issue proposed regulations for public comment in and final regulations in these proposed regulations may include additional requirements with significant impact for ccb management  beneficial use applications and disposal 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the impact of these information collection requests or potential regulations resulting from such requests 
closed ash landfill sites in  ipl received communication from the iowa dnr regarding an evaluation of groundwater monitoring results for four of its closed ash landfills and a request to further evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills 
the iowa dnr approved ipl s plans to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at these two landfills  which were implemented beginning in work was completed at one of the landfills in work at the other landfill has not been completed pending access agreements from two neighboring property owners to install additional groundwater monitoring wells 
one access agreement was obtained in and installation of wells at that location was completed in december ipl provides periodic updates to the iowa dnr on the status of implementing the monitoring plan 
results from this additional monitoring will be evaluated by the iowa dnr to determine if further actions are required

epa ghg rulemakings climate change continues to garner public attention along with support for policymakers to take action to mitigate global warming 
there is considerable debate regarding the public policy response that the us should adopt  involving both domestic actions and international efforts 
several members of congress have proposed legislation to regulate ghg emissions  primarily targeting reductions of carbon dioxide co emissions 
in addition  efforts are underway by the epa to respond to a court ruling that could require rules to reduce ghg emissions  including assessment of whether or how the agency should regulate ghg emissions 
initiatives to address ghg emissions are also underway in the states covering alliant energy s utility service territories 
given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future regulations regarding the control of ghg emissions  alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently cannot predict the financial impact of any future climate change regulations on their operations but believe the expenditures to comply with any new emissions regulations could be significant 
refer to legislative matters climate change legislative developments for federal and state legislative initiatives to address ghg emissions 
epa mandatory ghg reporting rule in december  the final epa mandatory ghg reporting rule became effective 
the final rule does not require control of ghg emissions  rather it requires that sources above certain threshold levels monitor and report emissions 
the epa anticipates that the data collected by this rule will improve the us government s ability to formulate a set of climate change policy options 
the ghg emissions covered by the final epa reporting rule include co  methane ch  nitrous oxide no  sulfur hexafluoride  hydrofluorocarbons hfcs  perfluorocarbons and other fluorinated gases 
emissions of ghg will be reported at the facility level in co equivalent coe and include those facilities that emit  metric tons or more of coe annually 
the final rule applies to electric utility and natural gas distribution operations at alliant energy  ipl and wpl 
the annual reporting compliance requirement begins for the calendar year  with the first ghg emissions reports due by march  the primary ghg emitted from alliant energy s utility operations is co from the combustion of fossil fuels at its larger electric generating facilities 
alliant energy s annual co emissions from its larger electric generating facilities  in terms of total mass  ranged from million tons or million metric tons to million tons or million metric tons during the through period 
these amounts represent emissions from ipl s and wpl s ownership portion of fossil fueled electric generating units with a design nameplate of mw or greater that are required to be equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems 
alliant energy is currently updating its emissions monitoring methodologies to capture all the ghg emissions data required to comply with the epa s mandatory ghg reporting rule 
ghg endangerment and cause or contribute finding in april  the epa issued a proposed endangerment and cause or contribute findings for ghg under the caa 
this proposal includes two distinct findings regarding ghg emissions under the caa 
first  the current and projected concentrations of ghg emissions in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
this is referred to as the endangerment finding and includes the six key ghg emissions identified in the epa s proposed reporting rule 
second  the combined emissions of co  ch  no  and hfcs from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key ghg emissions and hence to the threat of climate change 
this is referred to as the cause or contribute finding 
the epa s proposed findings do not include any specific regulations that mandate reductions in ghg emissions 
however  finalization of these findings is requisite to epa s future issuance of regulations to reduce ghg emissions from motor vehicles or other emissions sources  which could include electric utility operations 
in december  the epa published the final rule for this finding with an effective date of january the final rule is currently being challenged by several groups in the dc circuit court 
the implications of the epa s findings are highly uncertain  including the nature or timing related to future issuance of regulations mandating reductions of ghg emissions 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the epa s findings  but expect that expenditures to comply with any regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant 
ghg tailoring rule in october  the epa published the ghg tailoring rule proposal to establish ghg permit applicability thresholds 
this proposed rule defines when caa permits under the psd and title v programs would be required for new and existing large industrial facilities 
the proposed rule would create a new emissions threshold  tons per year coe for ghg emissions 
new and significantly modified facilities would be required to obtain psd pre construction permits that demonstrate use of bact and energy efficiency measures to minimize ghg emissions 
existing facilities may also be required to obtain a revised title v operating permit if their ghg emissions exceed the proposed threshold 
a final ghg tailoring rule is anticipated in the first half of alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the epa s proposed permitting rule  but expect that expenditures to comply with any regulations to reduce ghg emissions could be significant 
chicago climate exchange ccx alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to take voluntary measures to reduce their emissions including co and other ghg as prudent steps to address potential climate change regulation

legislative matters climate change legislative developments federal the us congress is currently debating various forms of legislation to regulate ghg emissions  including legislation to create a cap and trade program ie  ie approved by the house in june 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are not able to determine what  if any  ghg legislation will finally be enacted  or the impact of such legislation 
if enacted  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe that ghg legislation could have a material adverse impact on their financial condition and results of operations 
midwestern governors association ghg accord ghg accord the midwest governors association began a process in to develop a series of policy recommendations and proposals to address various climate change ghg issues 
various recommendations have come from the process related to infrastructure siting and carbon sequestration studies 
other recommendations outlined a system to enable a regional market based multi sector cap and trade program for ghg reductions 
the recommendations for a cap and trade system are still under discussion  and any final recommendations will be advisory only in the form of a model rule 
any adoption of any cap and trade or other ghg reduction proposals that are allowed under interstate commerce and other federal law will have to be adopted by member states subject to the approval of their legislatures and governors 
wisconsin in april  governor doyle signed executive order  which created the wisconsin task force on global warming gwtf 
in july  the gwtf issued its final report containing policy recommendations for state level actions to address climate change 
the report contains short and long term goals and action items wisconsin might undertake  and it was understood legislation would be introduced where needed to accomplish the recommendations 
in  senate bill and assembly bill were introduced proposing enactment of some of the gwtf recommendations 
the most significant provisions of these bills include increasing the wisconsin renewable portfolio standard rps to by and by  requiring a portion by and by of the rps to be met with renewable sources located in wisconsin  implementing a statewide goal of annual energy savings and expanding energy efficiency programs and spending to accomplish this goal  and allowing the pscw to mandate utilities to make power purchases at prices higher than avoided cost feed in tariffs from small distributed renewable generation owned by third parties 
the bills do not propose a wisconsin or regional cap and trade regime 
alliant energy and wpl expect final action on these proposals by april alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts these initiatives will have on their future financial condition or results of operations 
iowa and minnesota no specific ghg legislation is currently being considered in iowa or minnesota 
other recent legislative developments american recovery and reinvestment act of in february  the arra was enacted 
the most significant provisions of the arra for alliant energy  ipl and wpl provide a one year extension of the bonus depreciation deduction for certain expenditures for property that is acquired or constructed in  incentives for wind facilities placed in service by dec 
 and grants for qualifying investments that are expected to improve the electric grid and transportation infrastructure 
based on capital projects placed into service in  alliant energy  ipl and wpl estimate their bonus tax depreciation deduction to be approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these bonus tax depreciation deductions significantly reduced the amount of cash taxes paid by alliant energy  ipl and wpl in refer to other matters other future considerations for additional details of potential incentives for ipl s and wpl s proposed wind projects and grants related to its investments in transportation infrastructure

wisconsin senate bill in february  sb was enacted 
the most significant provision of sb for alliant energy  ipl and wpl requires combined reporting for corporate income taxation in wisconsin beginning with tax returns filed for the calendar year this provision will require legal entities in which alliant energy owns a or more interest to file as members of a unitary return in wisconsin 
in addition  the provisions of sb make it unlikely that alliant energy will be able to utilize the majority of its current wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards before they expire

both versions of healthcare legislation contain a provision that would eliminate the non taxable status of the subsidy provided to employers who continue prescription drug coverage for their retirees 
if healthcare legislation that contains this provision is enacted  alliant energy  ipl and wpl expect to record deferred income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  in the period the legislation is enacted 
federal regulatory reform legislation in december  the house approved comprehensive regulatory reform legislation hr 
the most significant provision of this legislation for alliant energy  ipl and wpl would create commodities futures trading commission regulations and mandatory clearing definitions  which may require alliant energy  ipl and wpl to post large amounts of cash collateral related to their derivative instruments 
during consideration of this legislation  an amendment was approved that narrowed the definition of major swaps participant to focus on systemic risk  not counterparty credit risk exposures 
as a result  alliant energy  ipl and wpl as well as other end users of derivatives may not fall under the scope of this legislation 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine the ultimate impact of this proposed legislation on their financial condition and results of operations

utility electric margins electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses 
management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues since electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses are generally passed through to customers  and therefore  result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes in electric production fuel  energy purchases and purchased electric capacity expenses 
electric margins and megawatt hour mwh sales for alliant energy were as follows revenues and costs dollars in millions mwhs sold mwhs in thousands a b a b residential commercial industrial retail subtotal sales for resale wholesale bulk power and other other includes wheeling total revenues sales electric production fuel expense energy purchases expense purchased electric capacity expense margins a reflects the change from to b reflects the change from to vs 
summary electric margins increased million  or in  primarily due to the impact of ipl s interim retail rate increase effective march  which increased ipl s electric revenues by million in  an estimated million reduction in electric margins in due to the loss of retail sales during electric service outages caused by the severe flooding in ipl s service territory in  million of lower purchased electric capacity expenses at wpl related to the rockgen energy center rockgen ppa  which terminated in may  million of incremental purchased electric capacity expenses at ipl in resulting from the severe flooding  million of higher energy conservation revenues at ipl  a million regulatory related credit recorded by ipl in related to the iub s approval to recover electric capacity expenses incurred in related to the severe flooding  and changes in the recovery of electric production fuel and energy purchases at wpl 
these items were partially offset by an estimated million reduction in electric margins from changes in the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities  a decrease in weather normalized sales volumes  million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses at wpl related to the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee ppa  million of higher purchased electric capacity expenses at ipl related to the duane arnold energy center daec ppa and a million reduction in electric margins from the impact of annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates

electric production fuel and energy purchases fuel related cost recoveries alliant energy burns coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity at its generating facilities 
the cost of fossil fuels used during each period is included in electric production fuel expense 
alliant energy also purchases electricity to meet the demand of its customers and charges these costs to energy purchases expense 
alliant energy s electric production fuel expense decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the decrease was primarily due to lower coal volumes burned at its generating facilities resulting from reduced generation needed to serve the lower sales volumes 
the decrease was primarily due to lower fuel volumes burned at ipl s emery generating station and at the generating facilities impacted by the severe flooding in ipl s service territory in alliant energy s energy purchases expense increased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the increase was primarily due to higher energy purchased volumes and higher costs in related to derivative instruments used to mitigate pricing volatility for the electricity purchased to supply to its customers 
the increase was primarily due to changes in commodity prices 
the impact of the changes in energy purchases volumes were largely offset by the impact of changes in bulk power sales volumes discussed below 
due to ipl s rate recovery mechanisms for fuel related costs  changes in fuel related costs resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and  therefore  did not have a significant impact on ipl s electric margins 
wpl s rate recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel related costs also provides for subsequent adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs  thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on its electric margins 
wpl s retail fuel related costs incurred in  and were all lower than the forecasted fuel related costs used to set retail rates during such periods 
wpl estimates the lower than forecasted retail fuel related costs increased electric margins by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

estimated increases decreases in alliant energy s electric margins from the annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates recorded in the second quarter were as follows in millions ipl wpl alliant energy sales trends retail sales volumes decreased and in and  respectively 
the decrease was largely due to a decrease in industrial sales  which was caused by reduced sales to two of ipl s larger industrial customers who transitioned to their own cogeneration facilities in and plant closures and shift reductions as a result of economic conditions in retail sales volumes in were impacted by temporary disruptions of electric service associated with severe flooding in at the peak of the disruptions caused by the severe weather  approximately  electric customers of ipl were unable to receive service 
the most significant impacts of these disruptions on electric sales related to several large industrial customers in cedar rapids  iowa who were unable to receive service after the flood 
wholesale sales volumes decreased and increased in and  respectively 
the decrease was largely due to the impact of weather and economic conditions in on the electric sales demand of ipl s and wpl s wholesale customers 
wholesale and retail sales volumes in were impacted by ipl s and wpl s sales of their respective electric distribution properties in illinois in february prior to these asset sales  electric revenues and mwhs sold to retail customers in illinois were included in residential  commercial and industrial sales in the electric margin table above 
upon completion of these asset sales  ipl and wpl entered into separate wholesale agreements to continue to provide electric service to their former retail customers in illinois 
electric revenues and mwhs sold under these wholesale agreements are included in wholesale sales in the electric margin table above 
the lower pricing for wholesale customers as compared to retail customers resulted in a decrease to electric margins following the sale of the electric distribution properties in illinois 
bulk power and other revenue changes were largely due to changes in revenues from sales in the wholesale energy market operated by the midwest independent transmission system operator miso and pjm interconnection  llc 
these changes are impacted by several factors including the availability of alliant energy s generating facilities and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets 
changes in bulk power and other sales revenues were largely offset by changes in energy purchases expense and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric margins

liquidity and capital resources overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they have  and expect to maintain  an adequate liquidity position to operate their businesses as a result of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities  operating cash flows generated by their utility business  and available cash and cash equivalents 
based on their liquidity positions and capital structures  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they will be able to secure the additional capital required to implement their strategic plans and to meet their long term contractual obligations 
access by alliant energy  ipl and wpl to capital markets to fund their future capital requirements is largely dependent on their respective credit quality and on developments in those capital markets 
liquidity position at dec 
  alliant energy and its subsidiaries had million of cash and cash equivalents and million million at ipl  million at wpl and million at the parent company of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities 
refer to cash flows financing activities short term debt for further discussion of the credit facilities 
refer to note d of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on alliant energy s cash and cash equivalents 
capital structure alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to maintain consolidated debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade credit ratings in order to facilitate ongoing and reliable access to capital markets on reasonable terms and conditions 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s capital structures at dec 
 were as follows dollars in millions alliant energy consolidated ipl wpl common equity preferred stock noncontrolling interest long term debt incl 
current maturities short term debt in addition to capital structures  other important financial considerations used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios  flexibility regarding the utility generation plans  state regulations and the levels of debt imputed by rating agencies 
the most significant debt imputations include a portion of the daec  kewaunee and riverside ppas and postretirement benefits obligations 
the pscw explicitly factors certain imputed debt adjustments in establishing a regulatory capital structure as part of wpl s retail rate cases  particularly those related to operating leases and ppas 
the iub does not make any explicit adjustments for imputed debt in establishing capital ratios used in determining rates  although such adjustments are considered by ipl in recommending an equity ratio 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl intend to manage their respective capital structures in such a way that they do not compromise their ability to raise the necessary funding required to enable them to continue to provide utility services reliably and at reasonable costs  while maintaining financial capital structure targets consistent with those approved by regulators 
key considerations include maintaining access to the financial markets on the terms  in the amounts and within the timeframes required to fund alliant energy s strategic plan  retaining a prudent level of financial flexibility and maintaining ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
the capital structure is only one of a number of components that needs to be actively managed in order to achieve these objectives 
both ipl and wpl currently expect to maintain a capital structure in which total debt would not exceed to  and preferred stock would not exceed to  of total capital 
these targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent developments and on their potential impact on ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
credit and capital market developments financial markets were subjected to considerable strain over the past two years  resulting in adverse impacts on the availability and terms of credit for businesses 
a number of initiatives have been taken by the us treasury department and the federal reserve system intended to contain the contraction of credit in the economy and of liquidity in the various capital markets 
these initiatives have resulted in a degree of stabilization  which has varied across different sectors of the capital markets 
financial market conditions continue to remain highly sensitive to the evolving economic outlook 
liquidity in the various markets has fluctuated unpredictably  as investment flows continue to alternate between the safety of shorter dated us treasury obligations and the higher yields associated with investments in corporate and or longer dated instruments 
concerns regarding the us dollar s reserve currency role  and the willingness of overseas investors to continue to buy and hold us treasury obligations  have also impacted the capital markets 
the uncertain profile and impact of prospective financial market re regulation contributes to the unsettled tone of the various market sectors 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware of the potential implications these credit and capital market developments might have on their ability to raise the external funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure plans 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl had already taken measures over the past several years to improve their financial strengths including reducing financial leverage  retiring debt  securing multi year committed revolving credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs and a committed source of alternative liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted  arranging an accounts receivable sales program for up to million at ipl as an alternative source of working capital financing  retaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund a portion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s current operating and capital requirements in the event of credit market disruptions  extending ipl s and wpl s respective long term debt maturity profiles and avoiding undue concentrations of maturities over the next few years  and converting certain of ipl s and wpl s pollution control revenue bonds from variable interest rates to fixed interest rates 
as discussed below  ipl and wpl retain flexibility in undertaking their capital expenditure programs  particularly with respect to capital expenditures to fund the investment programs within their strategic plans 
primary sources and uses of cash alliant energy s most significant source of cash is electric and gas sales to its utility customers 
cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return on the rate base assets required to provide such services 
utility operating cash flows are expected to cover the majority of ipl s and wpl s capital expenditures required to maintain their current infrastructure and dividends paid to alliant energy s shareowners 
capital requirements needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures related to new generating facilities and environmental compliance programs  are expected to be financed primarily through external financings 
ongoing monitoring of credit and capital market conditions allows management to evaluate the availability of funding and the terms and conditions attached to such financing 
in order to maintain debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade ratings  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may periodically fund such capital requirements with additional debt and equity

other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  investment prices  currency exchange rates and interest rates 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl have risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to notes i and of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s derivative instruments 
commodity price alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of commodities they procure and market 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl employ established policies and procedures to mitigate their risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
specifically  ipl and wpl have entered into several commodity derivative instruments to substantially hedge their open positions related to electric supply in however  ipl and wpl still have some exposure to commodity risk as a result of changes in their forecasted electric demand  expected availability of their generating units and the limitations of wpl s electric risk management plan ermp discussed below 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is also significantly mitigated by current rate making structures in place for recovery of its electric production fuel and purchased energy expenses fuel related costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s electric and gas tariffs and wpl s gas and wholesale electric tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs 
ipl s and wpl s rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices for alliant energy and wpl due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
wpl s retail electric rates approved by the pscw are based on forecasts of forward looking test year periods and include estimates of future fuel related costs per mwh anticipated during the test period 
during each electric retail rate proceeding for wpl that includes fuel related costs  the pscw sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel related costs used to determine base rates 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test period  wpl and or other parties can request  and the pscw can authorize  an adjustment to future retail electric rates based on changes in fuel related costs only 
the pscw on its own  or at the request of a party to the case  including wpl  can request that the pscw set rates subject to refund pending a review of fuel related costs 
as part of this process  the pscw may authorize an interim fuel related rate increase or decrease until final rates are approved 
however  if an interim rate increase is granted and the final rate increase is less than the interim rate increase  wpl must refund the excess collection to retail customers with interest at the current authorized return on common equity rate 
as part of wpl s retail rate case order effective jan 
  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs per mwh of based on million of variable fuel costs for wpl s test period and left unchanged the annual fuel monitoring range of plus or minus 
based on this current retail recovery mechanism  alliant energy and wpl have exposure to wpl s retail electric margins from increases in fuel related costs above the forecasted fuel related costs per mwh used to determine electric rates to the extent such increases are not recovered through prospective fuel only retail rate changes 
alliant energy and wpl have additional commodity price risk resulting from the lag inherent in obtaining any approved retail rate relief for potential increases in fuel related costs above the fuel monitoring ranges and the prospective nature of any retail rate relief  which precludes wpl from recovering previously under recovered costs from ratepayers in the future 
alliant energy and wpl are unable to determine the impact of changes in commodity prices on their future retail electric margins given the uncertainty of how future fuel related costs will correlate with the retail electric rates in place and the outcome of the proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
refer to rate matters for additional details of the retail rate recovery mechanism in wisconsin for electric fuel related costs including potential changes to wpl s electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism 
in october  the pscw issued an order approving an ermp for wpl that expires in december the ermp determines hedging options for wpl s electric operations and which costs of hedging transactions can be included in fuel costs for purposes of cost recovery 
the ermp was developed with the involvement of individuals representing key customer groups as well as pscw staff  and as proposed  included a number of new elements that would expand wpl s hedging options  including longer time horizons and greater protections for decisions made to take advantage of unusual market conditions 
however  in approving the ermp  the pscw added a new limitation that wpl may not hedge more than a cumulative of a future month s expected open position expected electric system demand less expected generation and firm purchases although this limitation may be waived for the month immediately preceding the future month in order to assure reliable provision of service 
investment price alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to investment price risk as a result of their investments in debt and equity securities  largely related to securities held by their pension and other postretirement benefits plans

currency exchange rate alliant energy and ipl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of corporate services master supply agreement with vestas to purchase wind turbine generator sets and related equipment 
a portion of the future payments under the master supply agreement are denominated in euros  and therefore  are subject to currency exchange risk with fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the impact of a hypothetical increase in currency exchange rates on the future euro denominated payments under the master supply agreement would increase the anticipated purchase price of the wind turbine generator sets and related equipment as of dec

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements 
based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to their business and the understanding of their financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management 
the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of their board of directors 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies alliant energy  ipl and wpl make assumptions and judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts for any contingent events that are both probable and reasonably estimable based upon current available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that alliant energy  ipl and wpl make in accounting for contingencies  and the gains and losses that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  could have a significant effect on the results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements

regulatory assets and liabilities alliant energy s utility subsidiaries ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  they are subject to accounting guidance for regulated operations  which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in future customer rates 
regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
ipl and wpl recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and liabilities 
management periodically assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and the regulatory liabilities are probable of future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies and historical decisions by applicable regulatory agencies regarding similar regulatory assets and liabilities 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the nature and amounts of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and liabilities as of dec 
 and long lived assets alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated balance sheets include long lived assets  which are not yet being recovered from their customers or may cease to be recovered from their customers as a result of regulatory decisions in the future 
as a result  alliant energy  ipl and wpl must determine whether they will be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from such assets to ensure recovery of the carrying value of the long lived assets 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl assess the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry  regulatory or economic trends 
when an impairment review is deemed necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl must make assumptions and judgments regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the recoverability and fair value of its long lived assets 
refer to note e of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of wind sites and wind turbine generators currently expected to be used by ipl and wpl to develop future wind projects  and ipl s sixth street generating station damaged by the severe flooding in unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various judgments and assumptions and significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations

accounting for these retirement plans requires the use of judgments and assumptions  which represent significant estimates 
there are many judgments and assumptions involved in determining an entity s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including employee demographics including age  life expectancies and compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future benefits costs 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually 
as of dec 
 alliant energy s most recent measurement date  future assumptions included discount rates of and to calculate benefit obligations associated with its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans  respectively  and an future annual expected rate of return on plan assets 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  management reviews various corporate aa bond indices 
the annual expected rate of return is based on projected long term equity and bond returns  maturities and asset allocations

accounting for income taxes requires judgments and assumptions to determine an entity s income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expenses each period 
these judgments and assumptions represent significant estimates and include projections of alliant energy s future taxable income used to determine its ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration and the interpretation of tax laws regarding uncertain tax positions 
judgments and assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed quarterly by management 
significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
federal net operating loss carryforward utilization alliant energy currently expects its federal tax return for calendar year will include a federal net operating loss of approximately million primarily due to an estimated million of bonus depreciation deductions allowed in under the arra 
federal net operating losses for each calendar year can be utilized to offset federal taxable income in other years by carrying the losses back two years or forward years 
alliant energy currently expects to utilize approximately million of its federal net operating loss to offset federal taxable income generated prior to and utilize the remaining million of its federal net operating loss to offset federal taxable income in the future 
based on current projections of alliant energy s future federal taxable income  the federal net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully utilized in the federal tax return for the calendar year alliant energy s federal tax return for calendar year included a federal net operating loss that was fully utilized to partially offset federal taxable income in and federal tax credit carryforward utilization alliant energy generates federal tax credits each year primarily based on the amount of electricity generated by wind projects at ipl and wpl and the amount of its research and development activities 
in addition  in prior years  alliant energy generated significant non conventional source fuel credits 
federal tax credits reduce alliant energy s federal income tax obligations in calendar years that alliant energy generates sufficient federal taxable income to utilize the tax credits 
if alliant energy does not generate sufficient federal taxable income to utilize the federal tax credits generated for that year  the federal tax credits can be carried back and carried forward to be utilized to reduce federal income tax obligations if sufficient federal taxable income exists in the carry back and carry forward years 
the federal tax credits have different expiration periods with the most stringent limiting the carry forward period to years 
as a result of federal net operating losses generated in and that were carried back to prior years  federal tax credits of million previously used in prior years federal tax returns will now be required to be carried forward to be utilized 
in addition  prior year s alternative minimum tax of million will also be carried forward as credits to be utilized 
federal tax credits generated in of million will also be required to be carried forward to be utilized 
based on current projections of alliant energy s future federal taxable income  all current federal tax credit carry forwards with specific expiration periods are expected to be utilized by wisconsin net operating loss utilization in february  sb was enacted 
the current provisions of sb make it unlikely that alliant energy will be able to utilize a substantial portion of its current wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
as a result  alliant energy recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets associated with its wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards  which increased income tax expense by million in at dec 
  alliant energy had deferred tax asset valuation allowances related to wisconsin net operating loss carryforwards of million 
capital loss utilization the provisions of sb and wpl s recent plans to be included in iowa consolidated returns in order to take advantage of efficiencies that will likely be available as a result of ipl and wpl sharing resources and facilities resulted in changes in expected state apportioned income tax rates 
these changes in expected state apportioned income tax rates resulted in changes in the amount of deferred tax assets related to wisconsin capital loss carryforwards and associated valuation allowances in at dec 
  alliant energy had deferred income tax asset valuation allowances related to wisconsin capital loss carryforwards of million 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding tax carryforwards and uncertain tax positions of alliant energy  ipl and wpl 
other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in mda  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item and in risk factors in item a  the following items could impact alliant energy s  ipl s or wpl s future financial condition or results of operations ipl s electric transmission service charges ipl currently receives substantially all its transmission services from itc 
the annual transmission service rates that itc charge their customers is calculated each calendar year using a ferc approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as attachment o 
the attachment o rate is based on itc s projected net revenue requirement for the upcoming calendar year ie the year the rates will be billed as well as a true up adjustment for any over recovered or under recovered amounts from the previous calendar year ie two years prior to the year the rates will be billed 
because attachment o is a ferc approved formula rate  itc can implement new rates each calendar year without filing a request with ferc 
however  new rates are subject to challenge by ferc if the rates proposed by itc are determined by ferc to be unjust or unreasonable or another mechanism is determined by ferc to be just and reasonable 
in november  ipl filed a ferc complaint against itc concerning certain cost components included in itc s proposed rates 
itc requested that the ferc complaint be dismissed on the grounds that the asset sale agreement between ipl and itc barred ipl from challenging the rate elements for a seven year period 
ipl maintains that its complaint does not take issue with the use of forward looking data to set rates and instead is challenging how these rates were implemented 
in april  ferc denied ipl s ferc complaint filed against itc 
ferc concluded that ipl had not presented adequate evidence that itc s formula rate implementation produced unjust and unreasonable rates with respect to operations and maintenance and administrative and general expenses for ferc also rejected ipl s allegations that itc had not been adequately forthcoming with information about its projected rates and true up 
in may  ipl filed a request for rehearing with ferc 
in june  ferc granted ipl s request for rehearing  however  it is unknown when ferc will take final action on the complaint 
in october  itc filed with miso the attachment o rate it proposes to charge its customers in for transmission services 
the proposed rate was based on itc s net revenue requirement for as well as the impact of a true up adjustment related to amounts that itc under recovered from its customers in the attachment o rate is approximately higher than the rate itc charged ipl in based on this proposed rate increase  ipl estimates the electric transmission service charges from itc for will be approximately million to million higher than in january  the iub issued an order authorizing ipl to use million of regulatory liabilities to offset the portion of the transmission service charges expected to be billed in related to itc s true up adjustment 
ipl currently plans to file retail electric rate cases in iowa and minnesota in to address the recovery of the remaining expected increases in transmission services charges from itc for refer to rate matters proposed changes to rate recovery mechanisms for proposals made by ipl to each of the iub and mpuc to implement an automatic adjustment clause for electric transmission service charges incurred by ipl to serve its utility customers 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to predict the ultimate impact of itc s proposed transmission rate increase for  but believe it could have a material impact on their financial condition and results of operations in retirement plan costs alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s net periodic benefit costs related to their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans are currently expected to be lower in than by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in expected net periodic benefit costs are primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses and higher expected returns on plan assets resulting from significant increases in retirement plan assets during approximately to of net periodic benefit costs are allocated to capital projects each year 
as a result  the decrease in net periodic benefit costs is not expected to result in a comparable decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses 
in addition  the pscw authorized wpl to defer million of other operation and maintenance expenses incurred in related to the retail portion of net periodic benefit costs that exceeded levels used to determine retail rates in refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans 
electric sales projections economic conditions alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently expecting modest decreases in weather normalized retail electric sales in compared to largely due to economic conditions in their service territories and reduced sales to two of ipl s industrial customers discussed below 
electric sales from industrial customers in are expected to be impacted the most as a result of the full year impacts of plant closures at various industrial customers in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s service territories in customer owned generation archer daniels midland adm  owner of wet corn milling plants in iowa and historically one of ipl s largest industrial customers  constructed a mw cogeneration facility and a mw cogeneration facility in clinton  iowa to meet its own electric demand 
adm fully transitioned to its cogeneration facilities in the fourth quarter of roquette america  owner of a wet corn milling plant in iowa and one of ipl s largest industrial customers  constructed a mw cogeneration facility in keokuk  iowa to partially meet its own electric demand 
roquette america transitioned to its cogeneration facilities in the second quarter of the transition of adm and roquette america to their cogeneration facilities is expected to result in a material reduction to alliant energy s and ipl s future electric industrial sales and electric margins 
ethanol production ethanol production in the us experienced growth since largely due to a mandate for ethanol usage in the energy policy act of and the promotion of e  a blend of ethanol and gasoline  used to fuel vehicles 
ethanol production facilities in the us are concentrated in the corn growing regions in the midwest given corn is the primary raw material used to produce ethanol 
electricity demand from new ethanol production facilities located in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility service territories has resulted in an increase in electric sales volumes 
currently there is one ethanol plant that is under construction within ipl s service territory  which is expected to be completed in late or early once completed  this plant may add another mw of electricity demand to alliant energy s existing demand from ethanol plants  which is approximately mw mw in ipl s service territory and mw in wpl s service territory currently 
a number of previously announced plants in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s service territories have not begun construction  which is reflective of a nationwide slowdown in the construction of ethanol production facilities 
this slowdown has been caused by a number of factors including changes in the price of ethanol  a decline in the cost of gasoline  an increase in the cost of corn  tighter access to financing and escalation of construction costs to build the production facilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to estimate the impacts ethanol production facilities in their service territories will have on their future electric sales demand and electric margins 
government incentives for wind projects alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s corporate strategy includes building wind projects to produce electricity to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards 
in addition to producing electricity  these wind projects may also generate material incentives depending on when they begin commercial operation 
the arra enacted in february provides incentives to owners of wind projects placed into service between jan 
 and dec 
 the incentives available to qualified wind projects under the arra include production tax credits for a year period based on the electricity output generated by the wind project  an investment tax credit equal to of the qualified cost basis of the wind project  or a government grant equal to of the qualified cost basis of the wind project 
the government grant incentive is only available for qualified wind projects that are placed into service in or and qualified wind projects that began construction in or and are placed into service by dec 
 alliant energy s utility generation plan has three wind projects that currently qualify  or are expected to qualify  for one of these incentives based on the provisions of the arra 
these three wind projects are ipl s whispering willow east wind project mw capacity that began commercial operation in the fourth quarter of  wpl s bent tree phase i wind project mw capacity that is expected to be fully commercially operational in  and ipl s whispering willow west wind project mw capacity that is expected to begin commercial operation in pending regulatory approval for the project 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to evaluate the three options to maximize the incentives for its wind projects 
selection of the government grant option must be made prior to the application deadline on sep 
 selection of the investment tax credit option must be made prior to the due date of the federal tax return for the calendar year the wind project begins commercial operation 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently plan to recognize production tax credits for their eligible wind project until an incentive option is selected for each project 
ipl currently expects to recognize production tax credits between million to million in for its whispering willow east wind project 
the amount of production tax credits is dependent on the level of electricity output generated by the wind project  which is impacted by a variety of operating and economic parameters 
any incentives for ipl s and wpl s wind projects are expected to be utilized in determining customers rates 
maintenance costs for wind projects wind projects require periodic maintenance to ensure reliability of operations 
ipl and wpl have entered into agreements with outside vendors to provide these services for their whispering willow east and bent tree phase i wind projects 
ipl and wpl currently estimate approximately million to million of annual maintenance expenses for each of its whispering willow east and bent tree phase i wind projects after they begin commercial operations 
incentive compensation plans alliant energy s total compensation package includes an incentive compensation program  which provides substantially all of alliant energy s non bargaining employees an opportunity to receive annual short term incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual operational and financial performance measures 
the operational performance measures relate to diversity  safety and customer satisfaction and the financial performance measures include utility earnings per share from continuing operations and cash flows from operations generated by ipl  wpl and corporate services 
in addition  the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long term incentive awards issued under an equity incentive plan eip 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of outstanding awards issued under alliant energy s eip and alliant energy s proposed omnibus incentive plan 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts these incentive compensation plans will have on their future financial condition or results of operations
