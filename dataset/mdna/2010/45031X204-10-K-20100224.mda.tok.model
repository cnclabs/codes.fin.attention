the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a commercial stage  multi specialty pharmaceutical company developing  marketing and selling our own products in the united states 
we manufacture our products through third party contracts and we in license or acquire promising new technology to add to our internal development efforts from time to time 
our products and product candidates seek to treat serious diseases of the eye and allergies and include therapies for ocular inflammation and pain  glaucoma  dry eye and ocular and nasal allergies 
the us prescription markets our therapies seek to address include key segments of the billion ophthalmic pharmaceutical market and the billion nasal allergy market 
we currently have four products available for sale in the united states and puerto rico xibrom bromfenac sodium ophthalmic solution for the treatment of inflammation and pain following cataract surgery  bepreve bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  istalol timolol maleate ophthalmic solution for the treatment of glaucoma  and vitrase hyaluronidase for injection for use as a spreading agent 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million including a non cash valuation warrant adjustment of million through december  results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
net revenues were approximately million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in revenues is the result of the following increased growth in prescription levels and market share for our core products  particularly for xibrom  launch of our newest product  bepreve  in september  resulting in million in net revenues  and recognition of million in of previously deferred income primarily related to the termination of a supply agreement 

table of contents the following table sets forth our net revenues for each of our products for the years ended december   and  respectively dollars in millions years ended december  xibrom istalol vitrase bepreve product sales  net license revenue total revenues 
table of contents gross margin and cost of products sold 
gross margin for was  or million  as compared to  or million  for and  or million  for the increase in gross margin in as compared to and is primarily the result of continued increased growth in prescription levels and market share  particularly for xibrom 
cost of products sold was million in  as compared to million in and million in cost of products sold for the three years consisted primarily of standard costs for each of our commercial products  distribution costs  royalties  inventory reserves and other costs of products sold 
the increase in costs of products sold during each of the three years is primarily the result of increased net product sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease is research and development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily the result of a decrease in both clinical development costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs  data management costs  and manufacturing costs  offset by million in milestone payments 
the decrease in both clinical development costs and manufacturing development costs is due to the timing of clinical trials  both initiation and completion 
during  because the clinical trials had been completed previously and regulatory filings had been submitted to the fda  we experienced a reduction in bepreve expenses 
the research and development expenses included a one time up front payment to in license bepreve  which did not occur in without giving effect to this one time payment  the increase in research and development expenses in resulted from an increase in clinical development costs  which include fda filing fees  clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management costs due the completion of the bepreve phase iii clinical trial and ocular safety studies  additional clinical costs for xiday and additional clinical costs for the ecabet sodium product 
our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for xibrom  bepreve  istalol and vitrase 
generally  our research and development resources are not dedicated to a single project but are applied to multiple product candidates in our portfolio 
as a result  we manage and evaluate our research and development expenditures generally by the type of costs incurred 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to clinical development costs  regulatory costs  pharmaceutical development costs  manufacturing development costs and medical affairs costs 
in addition  we also record as research and development expenses any up front and milestone payments that have been accrued to third parties prior to regulatory approval of a product candidate under our licensing agreements unless there is an alternative future use 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for clinical development costs  were for regulatory costs  were for pharmaceutical development costs  were for manufacturing development costs  were for medical affairs costs  was for both a one time milestone payment million upon the fda approval of our bepreve nda and a one time milestone payment million upon the fda acceptance of our bepreve nda and approximately for stock based compensation costs million 
changes in our research and development expenses in as compared to were primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  were million for as compared to million for  or a decrease of million 
the decrease is due in part to the variation in the initiation  timing and completion of clinical studies year over year 
in  costs include those associated with our xiday and our t pred studies and costs incurred in support of our bepreve nda 
there was a significant reduction in of our clinical costs as the work on bepreve was substantially completed 
additionally  we filed our bepreve nda in and received approval from the fda to market bepreve during the quarter ended september  regulatory costs regulatory costs  which include compliance expenses for existing products and other activity for pipeline projects  were million for as compared to million for the increase of million was due primarily to costs associated with the preparation of our snda filing for xiday in december and our participation in an fda advisory panel for bepreve in june pharmaceutical development costs pharmaceutical development costs  which include costs related to the testing and development of our pipeline products  were million in both and manufacturing development costs manufacturing development costs  which include costs related to production scale up and validation  raw material qualification  and stability studies  were million for as compared to million for  or a decrease of million 
the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in outside consulting costs and research related costs such as clinical supplies and stability studies 

table of contents medical affairs costs medical affairs costs  which include activities that relate to medical information in support of our products  were million for as compared to million for the increase of million is primarily due to post marketing studies related to our existing commercial products 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for clinical development costs  were for regulatory costs  were for pharmaceutical development costs  were for manufacturing development costs  were for medical affairs costs  and approximately for stock based compensation costs 
changes in our research and development expenses in as compared to were primarily due to the following clinical development costs clinical development costs were million for as compared to million for  or an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the continued efforts on the xiday once daily product  as well as the completion of the second phase iii clinical trial and ocular safety studies for bepreve 
regulatory costs regulatory costs were million for as compared to million for  or a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in regulatory activities 
pharmaceutical development costs pharmaceutical development costs were million for both and manufacturing development costs manufacturing development costs were million for as compared to million for  or a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in research activities  specifically stability costs 
medical affairs costs medical affairs costs were million for as compared to million for  or an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to post marketing studies related to our existing commercial products 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our product candidates through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial s protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product candidate 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to deviate from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates in certain indications  in order to focus our resources on more promising candidates or indications 
as a result  the amount or ranges of estimable cost and timing to complete our product development programs and each future product development program is not estimable 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to higher sales and marketing expenses associated with launching bepreve and expanding our sales force million  an overall increase in administrative costs  primarily legal expenses and personnel costs million  offset by a decrease in stock based compensation costs million 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in due to our sales force expansion 
the million increase in as compared to primarily results from higher sales and marketing expenses million  an overall increase in administrative costs relating primarily to legal expenses million  and an increase in stock based compensation costs million 
stock based compensation costs 
total stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we granted options to employees to purchase million shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
in addition to stock options  we also issued restricted stock awards 
total stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and included million  million and million  respectively  related to these restricted stock awards 
the following table sets forth our stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and  respectively dollars in millions years ended december  selling  general and administrative research and development share based compensation costs 
table of contents interest income 
interest income was zero in  million in and million in the decrease in interest income in was because our cash was not invested in interest bearing accounts as we sought to protect our principal 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily attributable to the overall reduction in interest rates during  lower cash on hand balances and other factors 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  million in as adjusted and million in as adjusted 
interest expense in included interest payments on our facility agreement million  interest on our borrowings under our revolving credit facility million  amortization of the deferred financing costs million  amortization of the derivative on the facility agreement million and amortization of the discount on the facility agreement million 
included in and is the impact of the change in accounting principle as required by the debt with conversion and other options topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  which required retrospective application 
this retrospective application required us to record additional non cash interest expense of million  or per share  for the year ended december  and million  or per share for the year ended december  this additional non cash interest expense represents the amortization of a debt discount recorded against our convertible notes on our balance sheet 
because our convertible notes were repaid in september  there was no impact to loss on extinguishment of debt 
the loss on extinguishment of debt of million is due to the write off of both the embedded derivative and the deferred financing costs related to the million convertible notes in september gain loss on derivative valuation 
derivative valuation was a gain of million in  a gain of  in and a loss of million in in  the gain was the result of a decrease in the value of the derivative 
during  the derivative associated with the convertible notes issued in was written off  in connection with the repayment of the convertible notes  and the value of the derivative associated with the facility agreement increased  resulting in a net gain of  during  the loss on the derivative valuation of million was the result of an increase in the derivative value 
loss on warrant valuation 
included in is the impact of the change in accounting principle as required by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  which required us to analyze the accounting for warrants under our facility agreement  issued in during  the warrants were classified as equity 
as a result of this change in accounting principle  we were required  due to certain provisions in the facility agreement  to reclassify the warrants as a liability 
specifically  because of the anti dilutive provisions in the warrant agreement  where additional warrants might be issued should we issue additional equity  with such additional warrants being issued at a price equal to the fair value of the common stock being issued  but not less than  we were required to reclassify the warrants to a liability 
additionally  the warrants will be marked to market and adjusted quarterly 
we recorded a non cash valuation adjustment for an additional million  or per share  in our financial results in the change in the valuation of the warrants was primarily driven by an increase in our stock price plus an increase in related volatility 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will continue to expire in  unless utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless utilized 
we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless utilized 
our california research tax credit carryforwards do not expire and will carryforward indefinitely until utilized 
financial outlook we expect our net revenues for will be approximately to million 
we continue to assume there will not be a generic to xibrom in we expect net revenues from our xibrom including xiday  assuming approval franchise to be in the range of to million and anticipate net revenues from bepreve will be at least million 
as in previous years  our net revenues are seasonal  with first quarter net sales typically being the lowest of the year and less than the prior quarter 

table of contents we expect our gross margin in will be in the range of to 
we expect research and development expenses to be approximately to of net revenues  depending upon the progress of our clinical programs 
in  we will focus our development activities on our bromfenac as a treatment for dry eye disease and our nasal formulation of bepotastine for nasal allergies 
we will initiate our full scale phase iii clinical program in dry eye disease with bromfenac  as well as the long term safety study required by the fda in advance of an nda filing 
to maximize our bepotastine franchise  we will complete our formulation work for bepotastine nasal and initiate the clinical program with this product as a treatment for nasal allergies 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for to be approximately to of net revenues 
we expect our operating income for will be to million 
we expect our net income for will be at least million  or earnings per share of at  excluding any mark to market adjustments relating to warrants 
once we are profitable  we expect our fully diluted common shares  including our outstanding shares of common stock  warrants and stock options on a treasury basis  will be approximately million shares 
we expect our business to generate to million in cash in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million 
for the year ended december  we generated million of positive cash flow 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our debt and equity securities 
since march  we have received gross proceeds of approximately million from sales of our common stock and the issuance of promissory notes  warrants and debt 
under our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable  plus the lesser of of net cash or million 
as of december   we had million available under the revolving credit facility  of which we borrowed million 
all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility were repaid in january all outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus a margin of 
in no event shall the interest rate on outstanding borrowings be less than  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the revolving credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and is collateralized by all of our assets 
an event of default under the revolving credit facility will occur if  among other things  i we are delinquent in making payments of principal or interest on the revolving credit facility  ii we fail to cure a breach of a covenant or term of the revolving credit facility  iii we make a representation or warranty under the revolving credit facility that is materially inaccurate  iv we are unable to pay our debts as they become due  certain bankruptcy proceedings are commenced or certain orders are granted against us  or we otherwise become insolvent  v an acceleration event occurs under certain types of other indebtedness outstanding from time to time 
if an event of default occurs  the indebtedness to silicon valley bank could be accelerated  such that it becomes immediately due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility 
unless repaid earlier  all amounts owing under the revolving credit facility will become due and payable on december  while we believe we will be able extend our agreement with silicon valley bank upon its maturity or refinance outstanding amounts with another lender  we may not be able to do so due to general economic conditions surrounding the current crisis 
if we are unable to renew our revolving credit facility or obtain suitable alternative debt financing  it may adversely affect our ability to execute on our business plan 
in september  we entered into a facility agreement with certain institutional accredited investors  which we refer to as the lenders  to loan us up to million 
we borrowed the entire million available under the facility agreement and issued warrants to purchase million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
outstanding amounts drawn under the facility agreement accrue interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable quarterly in cash in arrears 
we are required to repay the lenders of any principal amount outstanding under the facility agreement on each of september  and  and of such principal amount outstanding on september  additionally  any amounts drawn under the facility agreement may become immediately due and payable upon i an event of default  as defined in the facility agreement  in which case the lenders would have the right to require us to re pay of the principal amount of the loan  plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon  or ii the consummation of certain change of control transactions  in which case the lenders would have the right to require us to re pay of the outstanding principal amount of the loan  plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
an event of default under the facility agreement will occur 
table of contents if  among other things  i we fail to make payment when due  ii we fail to comply in any material respect with any covenant of the facility agreement  and such failure is not cured  iii any representation or warranty made by us in any transaction document was incorrect  false  or misleading in any material respect as of the date it was made  iv we are generally unable to pay our debts as they become due or a bankruptcy or similar proceeding has commenced by or against us  and v cash and cash equivalents on the last day of each calendar quarter are less than million 
the facility agreement also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business 
as of december   we are in compliance with all the covenants under the facility agreement 
in connection with the facility agreement  we entered into a security agreement with the lenders  pursuant to which  as security for our repayment obligations under the facility agreement  we granted to the lenders a security interest in certain of our intellectual property  including intellectual property relating to xibrom  istalol  vitrase and each other product marketed by or under license from us  and certain personal property relating thereto 
during  we generated million of cash from operations 
the positive cash flow we generated from operations was primarily the result of the growth of our business  offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
we had a net loss of million  offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities of million and non cash charges totaling million 
non cash charges primarily include million in loss on warrant valuation  million in stock based compensation costs  million in amortization of discount on the facility agreement  million in depreciation and amortization  million in amortization of deferred financing costs and million for the change in value of the derivative associated with the facility agreement 
during  we used million of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of million as adjusted offset by non cash stock based compensation costs of million  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the senior subordinated convertible notes of million as adjusted  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the facility agreement of million  change in the value of the convertible notes derivative of million  change in the value of the facility agreement derivative of million  amortization of discount on convertible notes of million as adjusted  amortization of discount on facility agreement of million  loss on extinguishment of debt of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
during  we used million of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of million as adjusted  offset by non cash stock based compensation costs of million  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the convertible notes of million  change in the value of the convertible notes derivative of million  amortization of discount on convertible notes of million as adjusted  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in  primarily due to the maturities of our short term investment securities million  offset by the purchase of equipment million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million during  primarily attributable to the maturities of short term investments million and the reduction in restricted cash required to secure interest payments on the outstanding convertible notes million  offset by the purchase of equipment million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in  primarily attributable to the maturities of short term investments million and the reduction in restricted cash required to secure interest payments on the outstanding convertible notes million  offset by the purchase of short term investments million and the purchase of equipment million 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  primarily as a result of net repayments on our revolving credit facility million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million primarily the result of the issuance of debt under our facility agreement in the principal amount of million  the net borrowings from the revolving credit facility of million  offset by the repayment of our convertible notes of million and debt issuance costs of million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million primarily the result of the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds to us of million before payment of offering expenses and placement agent fees of million 
additionally  we received million from the exercise of  warrants 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents  together with amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents however  our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of the commercialization of our products  sales and marketing activities  and expansion of our commercial infrastructure  related to our approved products and product candidates  the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials  the introduction of potential generic products  the rate of progress of our research and development programs  the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  activities and payments in connection with potential acquisitions of companies  products or technology  the results of inquiries from the subpoenas received in april from the united states district attorney s office  competitive  technological  market and other developments  and our ability to establish and maintain partnering relationships 
these factors may cause us to seek to raise additional funds through additional sales of our debt  or equity or other securities 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we have never been profitable  and  while we currently anticipate becoming profitable in  we might never become profitable 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million including a non cash valuation warrant adjustment of million  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  and a stockholders deficit of million 
in april we received subpoenas from the office of the us attorney for the western district of new york requesting information regarding the marketing activities related to xibrom 
from april through december   we incurred approximately million in legal fees associated with this matter and expect to incur significant expenses in the future 
in addition  if the government chooses to engage in civil litigation or initiate a criminal prosecution against us as a result of its review of the requested documents and other evidence  we may have to incur significant amounts to defend such action or pay or incur substantial fines or penalties  either of which could significantly deplete our cash resources 
as of december  such legal costs are neither reasonably estimable nor probable 
the dod s tricare retail pharmacy program pursuant to section of the national defense authorization act of  became effective on may  this regulation would require manufacturers to pay rebates to the dod on products distributed to tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies retroactive to january  the regulation requires that pharmaceuticals paid for by the dod through the tricare retail pharmacy program be subject to the federal ceiling price program  which would require manufacturers to provide dod with a refund on pharmaceuticals utilized through the tricare retail pharmacy program 
we have requested a waiver of the retroactive rebate for tricare retail pharmacy utilization for the period from january  to may  in addition  the regulation is currently the subject of litigation  and it is our belief that the retroactive application of the regulation is contrary to established case law 
we have determined that payment of the retroactive rebate created by the regulation is neither reasonably estimable nor probable as of december  we incurred legal expenses in the amount of million and million with the law firm  covington burling  during and respectively 
a member of our board of directors is senior counsel in this law firm 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations obligation under capital leases revolving credit facility facility agreement other long term debt obligations total includes million in principal amount of our facility agreement  bearing interest per annum payable quarterly in cash in arrears 
the facility agreement expires september we are required to repay of any principal amounts outstanding under the facility agreement on each of september  and  and of such principal amount outstanding on september  in may  we entered into a supply arrangement with sps biomedia ltd 
to supply hyaluronidase 
as part of the agreement  we were obligated to fund a portion of the construction costs  up to  for the build out of the laboratory 
the contract required an upfront payment of  and annual payment of  at an interest rate of per annum 

table of contents in addition to the above  we are committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs 
milestone payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the maximum potential future milestone payments to third parties are million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
included within these policies are our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
revenue recognition product revenues 
we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we recognize product revenues of estimated allowances for discounts  product returns  wholesaler fees  rebates and chargebacks 
if actual future payments and credits for allowances for discounts  product returns  wholesaler fees  rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous qualitative and quantitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated level of units in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of wholesaler distribution agreements  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and the estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we utilize on hand unit data purchased from the major wholesalers  as well as prescription data purchased from a third party data provider  to develop estimates of historical unit channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to both estimated historical prescriptions written and historical returns 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product which may be subject to various discounts  product returns  rebates  chargebacks and wholesaler fees 

table of contents we record estimated allowances for rebates  chargebacks  product returns and other allowances in the same period when revenue is recognized 
the objective of recording the allowances for such deductions at the time of sale is to provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate amount of credit to our direct customers or payments to our indirect customers 
customers typically process their claim for allowances such as early pay discounts promptly  usually within the established payment terms 
we monitor actual credit memos issued to our customers and compare such actual amounts to the estimated provisions  in the aggregate  for each allowance category to assess the reasonableness of the various reserves at each balance sheet date 
differences between our estimated allowances and actual credits issued have not been significant  and are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in general  we are obligated to accept from our customers the return of pharmaceutical products that have reached their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and  on a limited basis  exchanges for expiring and expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established reserves for such amounts at the time of sale 
we typically refund the agreed proportion of the sales price by the issuance of a credit  rather than cash refund or exchanges for inventory  and the returned product is destroyed 
with the launch of each of our products  we recorded a sales return allowance  which is larger for stocking orders than subsequent re orders 
to date  actual product returns have not exceeded our estimated allowances for returns 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns 
we identify product returns by their manufacturing lot number 
because we manufacture in bulk  lot sizes can be large and  as a result  sales of any individual lot may occur over several periods 
as a result  we are unable to specify if actual returns or credits relate to a sale that occurred in the current period or a prior period  and therefore  we cannot specify how much of the allowance recorded relates to sales made in prior periods 
since there have been no material differences between estimates recorded and actual credits issued  we believe our systems and procedures are adequate for managing our business 
allowances for product returns were and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of the our liability for products that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy  which allows customers to return products within six months of their respective expiration dates and for a period up to twelve months after such products have reached their respective expiration dates 
we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on the estimated units in the channel and the other factors discussed above 
our absolute exposure for product returns has increased as a result of increased sales of our existing products and our additional historical sales data upon which to analyze these allowances 
accordingly  reductions to revenue and corresponding increases to allowance accounts have likewise increased 
as a percentage of gross product revenues  the allowance for product returns was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we typically apply a higher allowance for product returns on stocking orders in connection with an initial launch 
we also periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customer base 
these discounts are calculated as a percentage of the current published list price 
accordingly  the discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the program is offered 
in addition to promotional discounts  which are recorded at the time that we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customer base an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of products at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels and therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon receipt by the customer and include the sale in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these sales represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction to revenues at the time of such sale 
allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and other discounts such as wholesaler fees were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts  chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements and fees charged by certain wholesalers under distribution agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts such as wholesaler fees at each reporting period based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative assumptions listed above 
as a percentage of gross product revenues  the allowance for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts  such as wholesaler fees  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively

amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless we have ongoing performance obligations 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of previously deferred income primarily related to the termination of our supply agreement with otsuka 
inventory inventories relate to i xibrom  a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory formulation of bromfenac for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery  ii bepreve  for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  iii istalol  for the treatment of glaucoma  and iv vitrase usp units ml for use as a spreading agent to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs 
inventories  net of allowances  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first to expire method 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
we adjust our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value if i a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  ii when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold  iii when a product has reached its expiration date or iv when a product is not expected to be saleable 
in determining the reserves for these products  we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand and its remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including management forecasts and levels of competition 
we have evaluated the current level of inventory considering historical trends and other factors  and based on our evaluation  have recorded adjustments to reflect inventory at its net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions  customer demand  competition or other relevant factors differ from expectations 
these estimates require us to make assessments about the future demand for our products in order to categorize the status of such inventory items as slow moving  obsolete or in excess of need 
these future estimates are subject to the ongoing accuracy of our forecasts of market conditions  industry trends  competition and other factors 
differences between our estimated reserves and actual inventory adjustments have not been significant  and are accounted for in the current period as a change in estimate in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs for all stock based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of stock based awards is estimated at grant date using an option pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
since stock based compensation is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we estimate the expected term based on the contractual term of the awards and employees exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately years 
income taxes we record a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in had market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later increases  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
seeking to minimize this risk  historically we maintained our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and auction rate securities 
all of our cash is held in non interest bearing accounts  which is fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
when our cash is invested in short term investments  the average duration is usually less than one year 
all outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus a margin of 
in no event shall the interest rate on outstanding borrowings be less than 
interest is payable on a monthly basis and may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate at december  was 
a change in interest rates on our revolving credit facility would not have had a material effect on our net loss for the year ended december  we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
