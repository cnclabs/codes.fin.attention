table of contents rate proceeding 
on march   the icc issued an order approving an increase in base revenues of approximately million  a rate of return on rate base of percent and a rate of return on equity of percent 
the order also approved an energy efficiency rider 
nicor gas placed the rates approved in the march  order into effect on april  on april   nicor gas filed a request for rehearing with the icc concerning the capital structure and return on equity contained in the icc s rate order contending the company s return on rate base should be higher 
on may   the icc agreed to conduct a rehearing concerning the capital structure but denied the remainder of the company s request 
on october   the icc issued its decision on rehearing in which it increased the annual base revenues approved for nicor gas in the march  order by approximately million  increasing the rate of return on rate base to percent 
nicor gas placed the rates approved in the rehearing decision into effect on a prospective basis on october  therefore  the total annual base revenue increase resulting from the rate case originally filed by the company in april is approximately million 
in december  nicor gas withdrew appeals of the icc rate orders that it previously had filed in state appellate court 
the icc s decision on rehearing  therefore  is final and no longer subject to appeal 
as a result of the rates placed into effect in  it is estimated that a degree day variation from normal  degree days annually impacts nicor gas distribution margin  net of income taxes  by approximately million 
bad debt rider 
in september  nicor gas filed for approval of a bad debt rider with the icc under an illinois state law which took effect in july on february   the icc issued an order approving the company s proposed bad debt rider 
this rider will provide for recovery from customers of the amount over the benchmark for bad debt expense established in the company s rate cases 
it will also provide for refunds to customers if bad debt expense is below such benchmarks 
as a result of the february order  nicor gas will record in the first quarter of a net recovery related to and of approximately million  substantially all of this amount is expected to be collected in the benchmark  against which actual bad debt expense will be compared  is approximately million 
capital market environment 
the volatility in the capital markets over the past two years has caused general concern over the valuations of investments  exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity 
the company continues to review its investments  exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to these items 
operating income 
operating income loss by the company s major businesses is presented below in millions gas distribution shipping other energy ventures corporate and eliminations 
table of contents the following summarizes operating income loss comparisons by the company s major businesses gas distribution operating income increased million in compared to the prior year due to higher gas distribution margin million increase  partially offset by higher depreciation expense million increase and operating and maintenance expense million increase 
gas distribution operating income decreased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expense million increase  the absence of million in mercury related recoveries recorded in  higher depreciation expense million increase and lower gains on property sales million decrease  partially offset by higher gas distribution margin million increase 
shipping operating income decreased million in compared to the prior year due to lower operating revenues million decrease  which were partially offset by lower operating costs million decrease 
lower operating revenues were attributable to lower volumes shipped and lower average rates 
operating costs were lower due primarily to lower transportation related costs  charter costs and payroll and benefit related costs 
shipping operating income decreased million in compared to the prior year as higher operating revenues million increase were more than offset by higher operating costs million increase 
higher operating revenues were attributable to higher average rates  partially offset by lower volumes shipped 
operating costs were higher due primarily to higher transportation related costs 
nicor s other energy ventures operating income increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating income at nicor s wholesale natural gas marketing business  nicor enerchange million increase and at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million increase 
higher operating income at nicor enerchange was due primarily to favorable results from the company s risk management activities associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses 
higher operating income at nicor s energy related products and services businesses was due to lower operating expenses million decrease  partially offset by lower operating revenues million decrease 
nicor s other energy ventures operating income decreased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to lower operating income at nicor enerchange million decrease  partially offset by higher operating income at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million increase 
lower operating income at nicor enerchange was due primarily to unfavorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory and lower results from the company s risk management activities associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses  partially offset by the favorable costing of physical sales activity 
improved operating results at nicor s energy related products and services businesses were due to lower operating expenses million decrease  partially offset by lower operating revenues million decrease 

table of contents nicor enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized 
a source of commodity price risk arises as nicor enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale 
however  gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market  whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change 
in addition  nicor enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utility bill management products offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses 
the gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided 
however  the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value 
for derivatives that either do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting is not elected  the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change 
as a result  earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change 
the volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period 
corporate and eliminations operating income for  and was impacted by the following items in and  corporate and eliminations operating income included costs of million and million  respectively  associated with nicor s other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather 
both periods exclude costs of approximately million recorded within other energy ventures 
in  there was no material weather impact related to other energy ventures utility bill management contracts 
the above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution business weather risk 
the amount of the offset attributable to the utility bill management products marketed by nicor s other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year  weather patterns  the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas 
in  corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of million 
the legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom nicor previously did business during the pbr timeframe 
the total recovery was million  of which million was allocated to corporate and million was allocated to the gas distribution business recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense 

table of contents results of operations details of various financial and operating information by major business can be found in the tables throughout this review 
the following discussion summarizes the major items impacting nicor s operating income 
operating revenues 
operating revenues by the company s major businesses are presented below in millions gas distribution shipping other energy ventures corporate and eliminations gas distribution operating revenues are impacted by changes in natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review 
gas distribution operating revenues decreased  million in compared to the prior year due primarily to lower natural gas costs approximately million decrease  warmer weather in approximately million decrease and lower demand unrelated to weather approximately million decrease  partially offset by the impact of the increase in base rates approximately million increase 
gas distribution operating revenues increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher natural gas costs approximately million increase and colder weather in approximately million increase 
shipping operating revenues decreased million in compared to the prior year due to lower volumes shipped million decrease and lower average rates million decrease 
volumes shipped were adversely impacted by the economic slowdown 
lower average rates were attributable to lower cost recovery surcharges for fuel 
shipping operating revenues increased million in compared to the prior year due to higher average rates million increase  partially offset by lower volumes shipped million decrease 
rates were higher due primarily to cost recovery surcharges for fuel 
volumes shipped were adversely impacted by decreased construction cargo  decreased tourism and increased competition 
nicor s other energy ventures operating revenues increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher operating revenues at nicor enerchange million increase partially offset by lower operating revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million decrease 
higher operating revenues at nicor enerchange were due to favorable results from the company s risk management activities associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses 
lower revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract  partially offset by higher average contract volumes 
nicor s other energy ventures operating revenues decreased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to lower revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million decrease and nicor enerchange million decrease 
lower revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management 
table of contents contract  attributable to product mix 
lower revenues at nicor enerchange were due primarily to unfavorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory and lower results from the company s risk management activities associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses  partially offset by the favorable costing of physical sales activity 
corporate and eliminations primarily reflects the elimination of revenues against nicor solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products 
gas distribution margin 
nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues 
gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review  and revenue taxes  for which nicor gas earns a small administrative fee 
these items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues  with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense  with no direct impact on gas distribution margin 
the rate orders included a franchise gas cost recovery rider and a rider to recover the costs associated with energy efficiency programs 
as a result  changes in revenue included in gas distribution margin attributable to these items are expected to generally be offset by changes within operating and maintenance expense 
a reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows in millions gas distribution revenues cost of gas revenue tax expense gas distribution margin gas distribution margin increased million in compared to the prior year due to the impact of the increase in base rates approximately million increase  partially offset by warmer weather approximately million decrease  lower demand unrelated to weather approximately million decrease and lower revenue from cost recovery riders approximately million decrease 
as a result of the rate orders  nicor gas will recover annual franchise gas costs over a twelve month period beginning the subsequent may 
prior to the rate orders  such costs were recovered based upon a fixed amount determined periodically through a rate case proceeding 
as a result of this change  franchise gas cost recoveries in are lower than prior periods with minimal impact on operating income 
in  the company also began recovering costs associated with an energy efficiency program 
gas distribution margin increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to colder weather approximately million increase and the impact of customer interest approximately million increase 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher payroll and benefit related costs million increase of which million relates to higher pension expense  net of capitalization  the absence of prior year cost recoveries of previously incurred costs million  of which million relates to a investigation of the presence of pcbs in the company s distribution system and million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom nicor previously did business during the pbr timeframe  higher postage charges million increase and higher costs on legal matters million increase 
partially offsetting these amounts were lower bad debt expense million decrease due to lower revenues attributable principally to lower natural gas costs  lower company use and storage related gas costs million decrease and lower costs associated with the aforementioned cost recovery riders approved in the rate orders million decrease 

table of contents gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher bad debt expense million increase and payroll and benefit related costs million increase 
higher bad debt expense is attributable to higher revenues and worsening economic conditions 
also included in gas distribution operating and maintenance expense for were the recoveries of previously incurred costs million mentioned above 
other gas distribution operating expenses 
mercury related costs recoveries  net reflect the estimated costs  recoveries and reserve adjustments associated with the company s mercury inspection and repair program 
mercury related costs in were million 
mercury related recoveries in reflect a million favorable reserve adjustment and million in cost recoveries
