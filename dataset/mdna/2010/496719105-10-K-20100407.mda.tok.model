item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview on july   we completed the acquisition of of the issued and outstanding common stock of kingstone insurance company kico formerly known as commercial mutual insurance company cmic pursuant to the conversion of cmic from an advance premium cooperative to a stock property and casualty insurance company see note to the consolidated financial statements acquisition of kingstone insurance company 
pursuant to the plan of conversion  we acquired a equity interest in kico  in consideration for the exchange of  principal amount of surplus notes of cmic 
in addition  we forgave all accrued and unpaid interest of approximately  on the surplus notes as of the date of conversion 
effective july   we now offer property and casualty insurance products to small businesses and individuals in new york state through our subsidiary  kico 
the effect of the kico acquisition is only included in our results of operations and cash flows for the period from july  through december  accordingly  discussions pertaining to kico will only include the six months ended december  until december  our continuing operations primarily consisted of the ownership and operation of insurance brokerage and agency storefronts  including barry scott locations in new york state  three atlantic insurance locations in pennsylvania  and four accurate agency locations in new york state 
in december  due to declining revenues and profits  we made a decision to restructure our network of retail offices the retail business 
the plan of restructuring called for the closing of seven of our least profitable locations during december and the sale of the remaining retail business locations 
on april   we sold substantially all of the assets  including the book of business  of the remaining retail business locations that we owned in new york state the new york sale 
effective june   we sold all of the outstanding stock of the subsidiary that operated our three remaining retail business locations in pennsylvania the pennsylvania sale 
as a result of the restructuring in december  the new york sale on april  and the pennsylvania sale effective june   our retail business has been presented as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
through april   we received fees from franchised locations in connection with their use of the dcap name 
effective may   we sold all of the outstanding stock of the subsidiaries that operated our dcap franchise business 
as a result of the sale  our franchise business has been presented as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
payments inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  is an insurance premium finance agency that is licensed within the states of new york and pennsylvania 
until february   payments inc offered premium financing to clients of dcap  barry scott  atlantic insurance and accurate agency offices  as well as non affiliated insurance agencies 
on february   payments inc sold its outstanding premium finance loan portfolio 
as a result of the sale  our business of internally financing insurance contracts has been presented as discontinued operations 
effective february   revenues from our premium financing business have consisted of placement fees based upon premium finance contracts purchased  assumed and serviced by the purchaser of the loan portfolio 
in our retail business discontinued operations  the insurance storefronts served as insurance agents or brokers and placed various types of insurance on behalf of customers 
our retail business focused on automobile  motorcycle and homeowner s insurance and our customer base was primarily individuals rather than businesses 
the stores also offered automobile club services for roadside assistance and some of our franchise locations offered income tax preparation services 
the stores from our retail business discontinued operations received commissions from insurance companies for their services 
prior to july   neither we nor the stores served as an insurance company and therefore we did not assume underwriting risks  however  as discussed above  effective july   we acquired a equity interest in kico 
principal revenue and expense items net premiums earned 
net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums  less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements 
the amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement 
insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
at the end of each reporting period  premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
our insurance policies typically have a term of one year 
accordingly  for a one year policy written on july   we would earn half of the premiums in and the other half in ceding commission revenue 
commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies  generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured 
net investment income and net realized gains on investments 
we invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity and equity securities 
our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets  less investment expenses 
net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable 
net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable  or are written down as a result of other than temporary impairment 
we classify equity securities and our fixed maturity securities as available for sale 
net unrealized gains losses on those securities classified as available for sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
other income 
we recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non payment 
we also recognize premium finance fee income on loans financed by a third party finance company 
loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred represent our largest expense item and  for any given reporting period  include estimates of future claim payments  changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and servicing claims 
these expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure 
we record loss and lae related to estimates of future claim payments based on case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience 
it is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information from the claimants 
our ability to estimate loss and lae accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability 
commission expenses and other underwriting expenses 
other underwriting expenses include acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
acquisition costs represent the costs of writing business that vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of insurance business principally commissions  premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries 
policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related premiums are earned 
other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees  telecommunication and technology costs  occupancy costs  employment costs  and legal and auditin g fees 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company  kingstone companies  inc these expenses include executive employment costs  legal  auditing and consulting fees  occupancy costs related to our corporate office and other costs directly associated with being a public company 
acquisition transaction costs 
acquisition transaction costs are the costs we incurred directly related to the acquisition of kico 
theses costs consist of fees for legal  accounting and appraisal services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of kico  depreciation of the office building used in kico s operations  as well as depreciation of office equipment and furniture 
interest expense 
interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then applicable interest rates 
interest expense mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
interest expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock represents amounts we incur on our outstanding preferred stock at the then applicable dividend rates 
gain on acquisition of kingstone insurance company 
gain on acquisition represents the excess of the fair market value of the net assets acquired compared to the acquisition cost 
interest income cmic note receivable 
we accrued interest income and accreted the discount on the surplus notes of cmic before the acquisition of kico on july  benefit from tax 
we incur federal income tax expense benefit on our consolidated operations as well as state income tax expense for our non insurance underwriting subsidiaries key measures net loss ratio 
the net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of net losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
net underwriting expense ratio 
the net expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned 
net combined ratio 
the net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit 
this is the sum of the net loss and net underwriting expense ratios 
if the net combined ratio is at or above percent  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio underwriting income 
underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income  interest expense and income taxes 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of kingstone companies  inc and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  our management has utilized information available including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our man agement in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and lae  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  the impairment of investment securities  intangible assets and the valuation of stock based compensation see note to the consolidated financial statements accounting policies and basis of presentation 
consolidated results of operations we completed the acquisition of kico on july  accordingly  our consolidated revenues and expenses reflect significant changes as a result of this acquisition particularly through the addition of our insurance underwriting business that now includes all of the operations of kico 
we have changed the presentation of our business results by reclassifying our previously reported continuing operations based on reporting standards for insurance underwriters 
the prior period disclosures have been restated to conform to the current presentation 
general corporate overhead not incurred by our underwriting business is allocated to other operating expenses 
due to the acquisition of kico and the commencement of our insurance underwriting business on july   and the discontinuance of all business operations previously in place before the acquisition date  the comparability of information between quarters and years is less meaningful 
in december  due to declining revenues and profits  we made a decision to restructure our network of retail offices the retail business 
the plan of restructuring called for the closing of seven of our least profitable locations during december and the sale of the remaining retail business locations 
on april   we sold substantially all of the assets  including the book of business  of the remaining retail business locations that we owned in new york state the new york sale 
effective june   we sold all of the outstanding stock of the subsidiary that operated our three remaining retail business locations in pennsylvania the pennsylvania sale 
as a result of the restructuring in december  the new york sale on april  and the pennsylva nia sale effective june   our retail business has been presented as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
effective may   we sold all of the outstanding stock of the subsidiaries that operated our dcap franchise business 
as a result of the sale  our franchise business has been presented as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
on february   we sold our outstanding premium finance loan portfolio 
as a result of the sale  our premium financing operations have been presented as discontinued operations

under this guidance  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants an exit price 
the statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources observable inputs and a reporting entity s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external m arket data is limited or unavailable unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy in gaap prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority level  followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities level  and unobservable inputs  including the reporting entity s estimates of the assumption that market participants would use  having the lowest priority level 
as of december   of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices 
as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  investments impairment review  we completed a detailed review of all our securities in a continuous loss position  and concluded that the unrealized losses in these asset classes are the result of a decrease in value due to technical spread widening and broader market sentiment  rather than fundamental collateral deterioration  and are temporary in nature 
the table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed maturity and equity securities by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of december  less than months months or more total unreal no

significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security s cost  the nature of the investment and management s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows effective july   the primary sources of cash flow is from our insurance underwriting subsidiary  kico  which are gross premiums written  ceding commissions from our quota share reinsurers  loss payments by our reinsurers  investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments 
funds are used by kico for ceded premium payments to reinsurers  which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance commissions 
kico also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business  commissions to producers  salaries and other underwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets 
in connection with the plan of conversion of cmic  we have agreed with the insurance department that for a period of two years following the effective date of conversion of july   no dividend may be paid by kico to us without the approval of the insurance department 
we have also agreed with the insurance department that any intercompany transaction between kico and us must be filed with the insurance department days prior to implementation 
the primary sources of cash flow for our holding company operations are in connection with the fee income we receive from the premium finance loans and collection of principal and interest income from the notes received by us upon the sale of businesses that were included in our discontinued operations 
if the aforementioned is insufficient to cover our holding company cash requirements  we will seek to obtain additional financing 
we believe that our present cash flows as described above will be sufficient on a short term basis and over the next months to fund our company wide working capital requirements 
our reconciliation of net income to cash provided from operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses  the timing of reinsurance  issuing company settlements and loss payments 
cash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources operating activities  investing activities  and financing activities  which are shown in the following table years ended december  cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  end of year net cash provided by operating activities was  in net cash used in operations was  in the increase in cash flow in was primarily a result of additional operating cash flows provided through the acquisition of kico on july  net cash flows used in investing activities were  in compared to  provided in the decrease in cash flow in was primarily a result of the additional investing cash flows used through the acquisition of kico on july   offset by the proceeds collected from the sale of our discontinued operations during the first six months of net cash used in financing activities during was  due to  of principal payments on long term debt and lease obligations  offset by  of proceeds from newly issued long term debt 
the acquisition of kico on july  had no effect on our financing activities

in exchange for this extension  the holders were entitled to receive an aggregate incentive payment equal to  times the number of months or partial months the debt was outstanding after september  through the maturity date 
the agreement provided that  if a prepayment of principal reduced the debt below  the incentive pay ment for all subsequent months would be reduced in proportion to any such reduction to the debt 
the agreement also provided that the aggregate incentive payment was due upon full repayment of the debt 
on may   three of the holders exchanged an aggregate of  of notes payable principal for series e preferred stock having an aggregate redemption amount equal to such aggregate principal amount of notes see discussion below 
concurrently  we paid  to the three holders  which amount represents all accrued and unpaid interest and incentive payments through the date of exchange 
in addition  on may   we prepaid  in principal of the notes payable to the five remaining holders of the notes  together with  which amount represents accrued and unpaid interest and incentive payments on such prepayment 
on june   we prepaid the remaining  in principal of the notes payable  together with  which amount represents accrued and unpaid interest and incentive payments on such prepayment

reinsurance via quota share allows for a carrier to write business without increasing its leverage above a management determined ratio 
the additional business written allows a reinsurer to assume the risks involved  but gives the reinsurer the profit or loss associated with such 
since the conversion to a stock company  we have determined it to be in the best interests of our shareholders to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance 
this will result in higher earned premiums and a reduction in ceding commission revenue in future years 
our participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our obligatio ns to policyholders 
inflation premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts 
we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation 
inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated  which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including salaries and benefits  generally are impacted by inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition based upon the following factors  as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  such factors  among others  may affect the accuracy of certain forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
given our recent acquisition of kingstone insurance company  we will face new risks and uncertainties 
as discussed in item hereof  on july   we completed the acquisition of of the issued and outstanding common stock of kingstone insurance company kico formerly commercial mutual insurance company cmic pursuant to the conversion of cmic from an advance premium cooperative to a stock property and casualty insurance company 
we have never operated as an insurance company  and we will face all of the risks and uncertainties that come with operating such a company  including underwriting risks 
as a holding company  we are dependent on the results of operations of kico  there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by kico 
we are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary  kico 
as a holding company without operations of our own  the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from kico 
consequently  we must rely on kico for our ability to repay debts  pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our shareholders 
in connection with the plan of conversion of cmic  we have agreed with the new york state insurance department that  until july   without the approval of the insurance department  no dividend may be paid by kico to us 
as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events 
because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  storms and certain types of terrorism 
we may incur catastrophe losses in excess of those that we project would be incurred  those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred  the average expected level used in pricing or our current reinsurance coverage limits 
despite our catastrophe management programs  we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our liquidity could be constrained by a cata strophe  or multiple catastrophes  which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability 
changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings  and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected ev ents that are inherently difficult to predict  such as a change in the law 
although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity  and a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the inability to obtain a financial strength rating from am best  or a downgrade in any such rating obtained  may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
many insurance buyers  agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by am best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance 
since kico became a stock property and casualty insurance company effective july   it has been seeking an am best rating 
a

best ratings are derived from an in depth evaluation of an insurance company s balance sheet strengths  operating performances and business profiles 
am best evaluates  among other factors  the company s capitalization  underwriting leverage  financial l everage  asset leverage  capital structure  quality and appropriateness of reinsurance  adequacy of reserves  quality and diversification of assets  liquidity  profitability  spread of risk  revenue composition  market position  management  market risk and event risk 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies such as am best review the financial performance and condition of insurers and can downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
we currently have a demotech rating of a excellent  which qualifies our policies for banks and finance companies 
in the event we do not obtain a satisfactory am best rating  there will be a material adverse effect on our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings and our ability to grow in the marketplace 
even if we obtain a satisfa ctory am best rating  because all ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a downgrade in any of these ratings could have similar effects 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
in the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay for capital expenditures or increase the amount of insurance that we seek to underwrite  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors  such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors occurs  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and  in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business 
our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes 
market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future 
if we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at pr ices that we consider acceptable  we will have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including changes in market conditions  whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance coverage  our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
applicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
we are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of new york which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of kico  our insurance company subsidiary  obtain prior regulatory approval 
in addition  a change of control of kingstone companies  inc would require insurance department approval 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
the insurance industry is subject to extensive restrictive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business  and changes within this regulatory environment may  too  adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business 
we are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
state insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices  including  among other things  the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes  which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes or prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk 
in addition  many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets 
because the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators and the sec  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpreta tion of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
while the united states federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal legislation and administrative policies can affect us 
congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies 
we cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that changes will not be made to current laws  rules and regulations  or that any other laws  rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future  that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk based capital  which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance markets 
the new york state insurance department imposes risk based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to support their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments  after taking into account default  credit  underwriting and off balance sheet risks 
if the amount of our capital falls below this minimum  we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and or keeping existing business 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  profitability or cash flows 
we recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer 
climate change  to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns  could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires and the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance 
our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business 
the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
because our operations are derived from sources located in new york  our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state 
all of our revenue is derived from sources located in the state of new york and  accordingly  is affected by the prevailing regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions in such state 
changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
adverse regulatory developments in new york  which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the insurance regulatory framework  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
recorded claim reserves in our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered  including actual claims paid  pending levels of unpaid claims  product mix and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered  which include  but are not limited to  law changes  court decisions  changes in regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves  and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
efplaceholder regulation requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the state of new york has enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in such state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive 
the insurance industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations  substantially more capital and significantly greater marketing and management resources 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for customers  agents and brokers  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel  our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered 
our future success will depend  in part  upon the efforts of barry goldstein  our president and chief executive officer  and john reiersen  president and chief executive officer of kico 
the loss of messrs 
goldstein and or reiersen or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to grow  we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  but we may not be able to do so 
our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors  such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results 
some economists continue to project significant negative macroeconomic trends  including relatively high and sustained unemployment  reduced consumer spending  lower home prices  and substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt  including defaults on home mortgages 
moreover  recent disruptions in the financial markets  particularly the reduced availability of credit and tightened lending requirements  have impacted the ability of borrowers to refinance loans at more affordable rates 
as with most businesses  we believe difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
general economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior  which may include decreased demand for our products 
as consumers become more cost conscio us  they may choose lower levels of insurance 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised  interpreted and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to support our operations 
the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  increased costs as a result of being an sec reporting company 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the sec  have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies 
as a reporting company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations 
based upon sec regulations currently in effect  we are required to establish  evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting and will be required to have our registered independent public accounting firm issue an attestation as to such reports commencing with our financial statements for the year ending december  we believe that  based upon sec regulations currently in effect  our general and administrative ex penses  including amounts that will be spent on outside legal counsel  accountants and professionals and other professional assistance  will increase in over  which could require us to allocate what may be limited cash resources away from our operations and business growth plans 
we also believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will divert time and attention of management away from operating and growing our business 
the enactment of tort reform could adversely affect our business 
legislation concerning tort reform is from time to time considered in the united states congress 
among the provisions considered for inclusion in such legislation are limitations on damage awards  including punitive damages 
enactment of these or similar provisions by congress or by the state of new york could result in a reduction in the demand for liability insurance policies or a decrease in the limits of such policies  thereby reducing our revenues 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or  if enacted  the form such legislation will take  nor can we predict the effect  if any  such legislation would have on our business or results of operations
