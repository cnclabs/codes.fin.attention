item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and all other statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  projections  and words of similar meaning  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
moreover  from time to time  we may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods  including the statements under outlook for fiscal  do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking 
table of contents statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
our business faces many risks  and set forth below are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
weakness in the united states us and international economies may harm our business 
our revenue levels are generally dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which includes worldwide expenditures for electronic design automation eda software  hardware  and consulting services 
the global economy continues to be weak  with continuing uncertainty in the credit markets and banking systems  reduced capital spending  and significant job losses 
this volatility and uncertainty about future economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and postpone decisions to license or purchase our products  decrease our customers spending  and jeopardize or delay our customers ability or willingness to make payment obligations  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we cannot predict the duration of the global economic downturn or subsequent recovery 
our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate 
our revenues  particularly new software license revenues  are difficult to forecast 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast revenues and trends in our business 
sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision  the dollar amount of the sale  and the products or services to be sold 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  in part because the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and requires management judgment 
a variation in the conversion rate could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations 
in particular  a slowdown in customer spending or weak economic conditions generally can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as purchasing decisions are delayed  reduced in amount  or cancelled 
the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter in an attempt to obtain more favorable terms 
our business could be impacted by fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns  the timing of significant orders  and the mix of licenses and products purchased by our customers 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of these are not within our control  including customer demand and the timing of significant orders 
we typically experience seasonality in demand for our products  due to the purchasing cycles of our customers  with revenues in the fourth quarter generally being the highest 
if planned contract renewals with large customers are delayed or the average size of renewed contracts do not increase as we anticipate  we could fail to meet our and investors expectations  which could have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
our revenues are also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where we recognize software revenues as payments become due and payable  on a cash basis  or ratably over the license term as compared to revenues recognized at the beginning of the license term 
we recognize revenues ratably over the license term  for instance  when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable  due and payable  and or cash based revenue recognition could result in increased deferral of software revenues to future periods and would decrease current revenues  which could result in us not meeting near term revenue expectations 
the gross margin on our software is greater than that for our emulation hardware systems  software support  and professional services 
therefore  our gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
we have a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenues would likely have a relatively large negative effect on gross margins and earnings 
if anticipated revenues do not materialize as expected  our gross margins and earnings could be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents we face intense competition in the eda industry 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share  and additional working capital requirements 
if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products  we may need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
any such changes would likely reduce margins and could materially adversely impact our operating results 
any broad based changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as the sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle certain software products at low prices for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could significantly reduce demand for our products or constrain prices we can charge 
we currently compete primarily with two large companies synopsys  inc and cadence design systems  inc we also compete with numerous smaller companies and compete with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed their own eda products internally 
our international operations and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations expose us to additional risks 
we typically generate about half of our revenues from customers outside the us and we generate approximately one third of our expenses outside the us significant changes in currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on us 
in addition  international operations subject us to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  local labor laws  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings  and difficulties with licensing and protecting our intellectual property rights 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from relatively few product groups 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of relatively few product groups and related support services 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycles  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition  and economic and market conditions  could harm our operating results 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit ic and electronics systems industries 
purchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by customers in the ic and electronics systems industries 
these industries are highly cyclical and are subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles  and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the ic and electronics systems industries regularly experience significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles within such companies or decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns could cause diminished demand for our products and services 
customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered 
these customer obligations are typically not cancelable  but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed 
in these cases  we may generally take legal action to recover amounts owed  if warranted 
moreover  existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses  particularly in the current troubled economic environment 
though we have not  to date  experienced a material level of defaults or renegotiated a material level of pre existing contractual commitments  any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these risks may be exacerbated by the global economic environment because our revenue forecasts assume i customers whose payments are recognized as revenue only when paid will make future payments as scheduled  and ii customers whose credit ratings and financial circumstances have deteriorated since we originally booked contracts with them will make future payments as scheduled 

table of contents customer payment defaults could adversely affect our timing of revenue recognition 
we use fixed term license agreements as standard business practices with customers we believe are creditworthy 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements have payments spread over the license term and are typically about three years in length for semiconductor companies and about four years in length for military and aerospace companies 
the complexity of these agreements tends to increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  and disputes 
if we are unable to collect under these agreements  our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
we use these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products  or services 
if we no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on the terms of the agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized under us generally accepted accounting principles as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change could have a material impact on our results 
ic and printed circuit board pcb technology evolves rapidly 
the complexity of ics and pcbs continues to rapidly increase 
in response to this increasing complexity  new design tools and methodologies must be invented or acquired quickly to remain competitive 
if we fail to quickly respond to new technological developments  our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive  which could materially adversely impact our business 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
due to the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software  or the products or systems designed with or manufactured using our tools may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased support or service costs 
in addition  we include limited amounts of third party technology in our products and we rely on those third parties to provide support services to us 
failure of those third parties to provide necessary support services could materially adversely impact our business 
long sales cycles and delay in customer completion of projects make the timing of our revenues difficult to predict 
we have a lengthy sales cycle 
a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process is generally required due to the complexity and expense associated with our products and services 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenues and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of our products and services is sometimes discretionary and may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects due to budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles  or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
disruptions of our indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results 
our indirect sales channel is comprised primarily of independent distributors 
our relationships with these distributors are important elements of our marketing and sales efforts 
our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with distributors were terminated  if our relationships with distributors were to deteriorate  if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant distributor  or if the financial condition of our distributors were to weaken 
any loss of our leadership position in certain segments of the eda market could harm our business 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific segments of the eda market 
for example  one company may have a large percentage of sales in the physical verification segment of the market while another may have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong 
table of contents leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of our profitability arises from niche areas in which we are the leader 
conversely  it is difficult for us to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason we lose our leadership position in a niche  we could be materially adversely impacted 
accounting rules governing revenue recognition are complex and may change 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition are complex and have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software revenues at the beginning of the license period 
if this trend continues  new and revised standards and interpretations could materially adversely impact our ability to meet near term revenue expectations 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
our tax expense may be impacted if our intercompany transactions  which are required to be computed on an arm s length basis  are challenged and successfully disputed by the tax authorities 
also  our tax expense could be impacted depending on the applicability of withholding and other taxes on software licenses and related intercompany transactions in certain jurisdictions 
in determining the adequacy of income taxes  we assess the likelihood of the positions taken on our tax returns being sustained 
the internal revenue service irs and tax authorities in other countries where we do business regularly examine our tax returns  and such examinations could result in adverse outcomes 
the ultimate outcome of these examinations cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations  we may be required to record charges to operations that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
forecasting our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty 
the computation of income tax expense benefit is complex as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provision under us generally accepted accounting principles 
income tax expense benefit for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our global tax rate for the year  which includes forward looking financial projections  including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction  and contains numerous assumptions 
various items cannot be accurately forecasted  and may be treated as discrete accounting 
examples of items which could cause variability in the rate include tax deductions for stock option expense  application of transfer pricing rules and changes in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
future events  such as changes in our business and the tax law in the jurisdictions where we do business  could also affect our rate 
for these reasons  our global tax rate may be materially different than our forecast 
there are limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
we do not expect that disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 
we may not realize revenue as a result of our investments in research and development 
we incur substantial expense to develop new software products 
research and development activities are often performed over long periods of time 
this effort may not result in a successful product offering 
as a result  we could realize little or no revenue related to our investment in research and development 
we may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them 
the industry in which we compete has experienced significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  we have acquired numerous businesses and we may acquire other businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  we cannot assure that any transaction that is 
table of contents completed will result in long term benefits to us or our shareholders or that we will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business  it could materially adversely impact us difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from ongoing business when integrating the acquired business  the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of previously unknown liabilities assumed with the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and increases in revenues  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering  and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  unanticipated litigation in connection with or as a result of an acquisition  including claims from terminated employees  customers  or third parties  adverse impacts on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls  and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings  and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors could impair our ability to forecast  meet revenues and earnings targets  and manage effectively our business for long term growth 
we cannot assure that we can effectively meet these challenges 
we may not adequately protect our proprietary rights or we may fail to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses 
our success depends  in large part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses  and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate  or circumvent these protections 
the companies in the eda industry  as well as entities and persons outside the industry  are obtaining patents at a rapid rate 
many of these entities have substantially larger patent portfolios than we have 
as a result  we may on occasion be forced to engage in costly patent litigation to protect our rights or defend our customers rights 
we may also need to settle these claims on terms that are unfavorable  such settlements could result in the payment of significant damages or royalties  or force us to stop selling or redesign one or more products 
we cannot assure that the rights granted under our patents will provide us with any competitive advantage  that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications  or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the us some of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights from third parties on favorable terms could materially adversely impact us 
our use of open source software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation 
the products or technologies we acquire  license or develop may incorporate so called open source software  and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future 
such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses  including  for example  the gnu general public license  the gnu lesser general public license  and other open source licenses 
we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend 
although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for 
table of contents open source software that we use such that we have not triggered any of these conditions  there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of these types of licenses 
as a result  the potential impact of these terms on our business may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and technologies  such as requirements that we offer our products that use the open source software for no cost  that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon  incorporating or using the open source software  and or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software 
our failure to attract and retain key employees may harm us 
we depend on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  our research and development staff  and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical  and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and we cannot assure that we can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
our failure to hire and retain such personnel could impair our ability to develop new products and manage our business effectively 
we have global sales and research and development offices in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states 
we have global sales and research and development offices  some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states 
as a result  we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically 
oregon law may have anti takeover effects 
the oregon control share act and the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over us 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required to acquire control of us through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
the provisions of the oregon control share act and the business combination act could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of us  could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and could materially adversely impact the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
we have a substantial level of indebtedness 
as of january   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  which includes million of floating rate convertible subordinated debentures floating rate debentures due  million of convertible subordinated debentures debentures due  and million in short term borrowings 
this level of indebtedness among other things could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt  make it difficult for us to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the floating rate debentures and debentures  and place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 
if we experience a decline in revenues  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents our stock price is volatile  and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements  or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings  and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
our revolving credit facility has financial and non financial covenants  and default of any covenant could materially adversely impact us 
our bank revolving credit facility imposes operating restrictions on us in the form of financial and non financial covenants 
financial covenants include adjusted quick ratio  minimum tangible net worth  leverage ratio  senior leverage ratio  and minimum cash and accounts receivable ratio 
if we were to fail to comply with the financial covenants and did not obtain a waiver from our lenders  we would be in default under the revolving credit facility and our lenders could terminate the facility and demand immediate repayment of all outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility 
the declaration of an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we could also find it difficult to obtain other bank lines or credit facilities on comparable terms

item properties we own six buildings on acres of land in wilsonville  oregon 
we occupy approximately  square feet in four of those buildings  as our corporate headquarters 
we also own an additional acres of undeveloped land adjacent to our headquarters 
most administrative functions and a significant amount of our domestic research and development operations are located at the wilsonville site 
in january  we purchased three buildings totaling  square feet in fremont  california 
we plan to relocate all of our san jose research and development  sales  and administrative operations to fremont at the termination of the existing san jose leases in the third quarter of fiscal we lease additional space in san jose  california  longmont  colorado  redmond  washington  huntsville and mobile  alabama  and marlboro and waltham  massachusetts where some of our domestic research and development takes place  and in various locations throughout the united states and in other countries  primarily for sales and customer service operations 
additional research and development is done in locations outside the united states including locations in armenia  egypt  france  india  pakistan  poland  sweden  finland  germany  russia  hungary  austria  taiwan  and the united kingdom 
we believe that we will be able to renew or replace our existing leases as they expire and that our current facilities will be adequate through at least the year ending january  item legal proceedings from time to time  we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise from the ordinary course of business 
these include disputes and lawsuits relating to intellectual property rights  licensing  contracts  and employee relations matters 
we believe that the outcome of current litigation  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations
