we incur routine drydock  inspection  maintenance and repair costs pursuant to us coast guard regulations and in order to maintain our vessels in class under the rules of the applicable class society 
for  these costs were million 
we defer these costs and amortize over the period from drydock completion until the next regulatory drydock is required  which is generally months 
these costs can fluctuate widely from year to year based on the number of vessels  the scope of the related work plan  availability of drydock capacity and general prevailing market conditions 
in addition to complying with these requirements  we have our own vessel maintenance program that we believe permits us to continue to provide our customers with well maintained  reliable vessels 
in the normal course of business  we charter other vessels on a short term basis  such as tugboats  cargo barges  utility boats and dive suppor t vessels

item legal proceedings insurance and legal proceedings our operations are subject to the inherent risks of offshore marine activity  including accidents resulting in personal injury and the loss of life or property  environmental mishaps  mechanical failures  fires and collisions 
we insure against these risks at levels consistent with industry standards 
we also carry workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  general liability and other insurance customary in our business 
all insurance is carried at levels of coverage and deductibles we consider financially prudent 
our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur  and litigation arising from such an event may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events  or that such insurance will continu e to be available at current levels of cost or coverage  we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations 
a successful liability claim for which we are underinsured or uninsured could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  primarily involving claims for personal injury under the general maritime laws of the united states and the jones act as a result of alleged negligence 
in addition  we from time to time incur other claims  such as contract disputes  in the normal course of business 
under our agreements with helix  we have assumed and agreed to indemnify helix for liabilities related to our business 
tax assessment during the fourth quarter of  horizon received a tax assessment related to fiscal from the servicio de administracion tributaria sat  the mexican taxing authority  for approximately million pesos  translated to million using the foreign exchange rate at december   including penalties and interest 
the sat s assessment claims that it is due unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries as well as penalties and accrued interest 
we have consulted with our mexican counsel and believe under the mexico and united states double taxation treaty that these services are not taxable and the tax assessment itself is invalid 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability for the sat s assessment for the tax year in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we received notice from the sat upholding the original assessme nt 
on april   we filed a petition in mexico tax court disputing the assessment 
we believe that our position is supported by law and intend to vigorously defend our position 
however  the ultimate outcome of this litigation and our potential liability from this assessment  if any  cannot be determined at this time 
nonetheless  an unfavorable outcome with respect to the mexico tax assessment could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation  and cash flows 
during  we successfully completed negotiations with the sat with respect to their claim of unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries for horizon s through taxable years  and paid an aggregate of approximately million in settlement of these periods 
horizon s through taxable years are now closed with respect to this particular claim by the sat 
although we reached an agreement and paid a settlement for the through tax years  the audit for these years have not yet been officially closed 
even though we have settled this issue for prior years under mexican tax law  the five year statute of limitations remains open  so our tax years forward remain open for examination in mexico

business and outlook the onset of a global recession in the fall of and the resulting decrease in worldwide demand for hydrocarbons caused many oil and natural gas companies to curtail capital spending for exploration and development 
despite this financial market and economic environment  we experienced steady demand for our services during the first three quarters this demand was driven in part by the need for inspection  repair and salvage of damaged platforms and infrastructure following hurricanes gustav and ike  which passed through the gulf of mexico in the third quarter  and increased domestic and international new construction activities  the capital budgets for many of which had already been committed prior to the end of however  demand for our services during the fourth quarter of was  and the first half of is expected to be  reduced for the following reasons reduced urgency by customers in completing the remaining hurricane repair and salvage work in the gulf of mexico  reduced new construction work due to significantly less drilling activity in  especially in the gulf of mexico  and fewer large projects utilizing multiple vessels planned for similar to projects completed in and which yielded significant profits 
although there is some evidence that the worldwide economy is emerging from recession  it is difficult to predict to what extent this will affect our overall activity level for generally  we believe the long term outlook for our business remains favorable in both domestic and international markets as capital spending will be required to replenish oil and natural gas production  which should drive long term demand for our services 
fiscal performance we earned net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  our performance compared to was adversely affected by lower vessel utilization  which was in declining to in  as a result of decreased new construction services partially offset by an increase in demand for hurricane repair work 
in addition  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of million in for customer disputes and bankruptcies  and our effective tax rate increased from in to in due to a lower percentage of profits being derived from foreign tax jurisdictions in as compared to  which typically have a lower tax rate than the us our fiscal performance was improved by a million reduction to cost of sales for insurance recoveries during  net of expenses recorded  for damages incurred to our property and equipment during resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike  and recovery on a claim from a prior year 
vessel utilization we believe vessel utilization is one of the most important performance measurements for our business 
as a marine contractor  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the winter and early spring due to winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
the seasonal trend for vessel utilization can be disrupted by hurricanes  which have the ability to cause severe offshore damage and generate significant demand for our services from oil and natural gas companies trying to restore shut in production 
this production restoration focus has led to increased demand for our services for prolonged periods following hurricanes  as historically shown in our results following hurricane ivan in  hurricanes katrina and rita in  and hurricanes gustav and ike in beginning in the fourth quarter of  we once again returned to more customary seasonal conditions 
the following table shows the size of our fleet and effective utilization of our vessels during the past three fiscal years number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization saturation diving surface and mixed gas diving construction barges entire fleet as of the end of the period  excluding acquired vessels prior to their in service dates 
effective vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels generated revenues by the total number of days the vessels were available for operation in each year and does not reflect acquired vessels prior to their in service dates and vessels in drydocking 
excludes the nine vessels acquired from horizon on december  results of operations operating results year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except revenues gross profit vessel utilization revenues decreased from to by million  or  and gross profit decreased by million or  due to lower vessel utilization  which declined from in to in  as a result of decreased new construction services partially offset by an increase in demand for hurricane repair work 
our gross profit for was increased as compared to for a million reduction to cost of sales related to insurance recoveries during  net of expenses recorded  for damages incurred to our property and equipment during resulting from hurricanes gustav and ike  and recovery on a claim from a prior year incurred in the ordinary course of our business 
revenues increased from to by million  or  and gross profit increased from to by million  or  as a result of contributions from certain horizon assets acquired in december the increase in revenues and gross profit was partially offset by lower vessel utilization  which decreased from in to in  related to winter seasonality and harsh weather conditions in which continued into may gross profit was also negatively impacted by increased depreciation and amortization for the horizon assets valued at their fair market value at the time of acquisition 
selling and administrative expenses year ended december increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues selling and administrative expenses increased from to primarily due to the horizon acquisition  including non cash amortization of related intangible assets of million and one time integration costs of million  increased employee benefit costs and increased information technology costs 
provision for doubtful accounts year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands provision for doubtful accounts percentage is not meaningful 
the provision for doubtful accounts recorded during was comprised of million reserved for customers that have filed for bankruptcy protection during the year and million for contract disputes with customers 
of the million reserved for customer disputes  million is from accounts receivable acquired with the horizon acquisition 
we intend to pursue all commercial and legal avenues for collection of the receivables currently reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts

in addition  we determined there was an other than temporary impairment in our minority ownership interest in offshore technology solutions limited or otsl  and recorded an impairment charge equal to the carrying value of our investment 
we sold our equity interest in otsl to a third party in for million and recorded as equity earnings of investment in our consolidated statement of operations 
other income expense is primarily from foreign currency gains and losses on transactions conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million during for abandonment of buildings and leasehold improvements 
interest expense  net year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except interest expense  net the decrease in interest expense  net from to is primarily due to lower variable interest rates associated with our credit facility during as compared to the increase in interest expense  net from to is related to increased debt assumed in december in connection with the horizon acquisition 
income tax rate year ended december  increase decrease to to income tax rate the increase in our effective income tax rate from to is due to a lower percentage of profits being derived from foreign tax jurisdictions in as compared to  which typically have a lower tax rate than the us the decrease in our effective income tax rate from to is due to a higher percentage of profits being derived from foreign tax jurisdictions in as compared to net income year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands net income weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding fully diluted earnings per share net income decreased from to by million  or  and fully diluted earnings per share decreased by per share  or  as a result of the factors described above 
partially offsetting the decrease in fully diluted earnings per share was a reduction in weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding from to  primarily as a result of the repurchase from helix and retirement of million shares of our common stock during net income increased from to by million  or  as a result of the factors described above 
despite the increase in net income  fully diluted earnings per share decreased by per share  or  due to a increase in fully diluted weighted average shares as a result of the issuance of million shares of our common stock in connection with the horizon acquisition in december liquidity and capital resources we require liquidity and capital to fund ongoing operations  organic growth initiatives and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility 
we use  and intend to continue using  these sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements  maintenance capital expenditures  strategic investments and acquisitions 
for  we anticipate capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million for replacements and vessel improvements and million of regulatory drydock costs 
in connection with our business strategy  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  including vessels and marine contracting businesses 
we believe that our liquidity will provide the necessary capital to fund our business activities and achieve our near term and long term growth objec tives 
we expect to be able to fund our activities for with cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have a credit facility  which consists of a variable interest term loan and a variable interest million revolving credit facility  with certain financial institutions 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million under our term loan  including current maturities  and no debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and the term loan mature on december   with quarterly principal payments of million being payable on the term loan 
we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan without prepayment penalty 
we may borrow from or pay down on the revolving credit facility as business needs merit 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
at december   we had million of cash on hand  million available under our revolving credit facility  issued and outstanding letters of credit of million under our revolving credit facility  and million of outstanding warranty bonds 
cash flows our cash flows depend on the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for marine contracting services 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  issuance and repurchases of debt and of our common stock  are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during compared to million in during  net income adjusted for non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and provision for doubtful accounts  provided million of cash  and net changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts provided million of cash 
during  net income adjusted for net non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and deferred income taxes  provided million of cash  and net changes in our working capital and other balance sheet accounts used million of cash 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million during compared to million in during and  cash used for capital expenditures were million and million  respectively  and cash provided by sales of assets was million during financing activities 
net cash used for financing activities was million during compared to million in during  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to fund the million repurchase of our common stock from helix 
we made scheduled payments of million under our term loan and paid million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which resulted in no amounts being outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  during  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to meet working capital needs 
we made scheduled payments of million under our term loan and paid million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which resulted in no amounts being outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  contractual and other obligations we lease several facilities worldwide and accommodations for certain employees located outside the us under noncancelable operating leases 
total rental expense under these operating leases was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

for information regarding our principles of consolidation  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and policies our accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our financial statements and related notes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our business and our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
revenue recognition we determine the appropriate revenue recognition accounting method for each of our contracts at the beginning of the project 
most of our revenues are derived from contracts that have a short duration 
these contracts contain either qualified lump sum provisions or provisions for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
revenue generated from qualified lump sum contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors may affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  delay the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we follow the accounting guidelines for the performance of construction type contracts 
the use of this method is based on our experience and history of being able to prepare reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
although we constantly seek to improve our ability to estimate contract costs and profitability  adjustments to total contract costs due to unanticipated events could be significant in future periods 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
property and equipment we record our property and equipment at cost 
we depreciate our assets primarily on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our estimates of useful lives of our assets are as follows vessels to years  portable saturation diving systems five to years  machinery and equipment three to years  and buildings and leasehold improvements three to years 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over the economic useful life 
we expense the costs of repairs and maintenance which do not materially prolong the useful life of the property and equipment as incurred 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions 
if such impairment indicators are present  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through projected net undiscounted cash flows based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset group 
the cash flows are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry trends  expected utilization and margins 
management s estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market condi tions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of long lived assets  which could possibly require an impairment charge in the future 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in for buildings and leasehold improvements we have abandoned 
we recorded no impairment charges to property and equipment in and recertification costs and deferred drydock costs our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
typically  these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock 
we defer and amortize drydock and related recertification costs over the length of time for which we expect to receive benefits from the drydock and related recertification  which is generally months 
vessels are typically available to earn revenue for the month period between drydock and related recertification processes 
a drydock and related recertification process typically lasts one to two months  a period during which the vessel is not available to earn revenue 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
goodwill and other intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  our goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
in certain circumstances  we also test for impairment of goodwill between annual tests  including a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  emergence of unanticipated competition  or loss of key personnel 
we test for the impairment of other intangible assets when impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions are present 
our goodwill impairment test is based on our single operating unit and reporting unit structure 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of our estimated fair value with our carrying amount  including goodwill 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized if the carrying amount of our net assets exceeds our estimated fair value 
our fair value is calculated by a combination of the discounted cash flow method and other market methods 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow and other market models to forecast operating cash flows  including projected revenue growth  operating profit margin percentages  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and terminal values 
a variance in forecasted cash flows or in the assumed discount rate could have a significant effect on our impairment test in future periods 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions and offshore exploration  development and production activity in the oil and natural gas industry 
any changes in such factors may negatively affect our business and result in a future goodwill impairment 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   and goodwill was not impaired as our estimated fair value exceeded our carrying amount by 
we will continue to test our goodwill annually on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce our fair value below its carrying amount 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the current provision for income tax is based upon the current tax laws and our interpretation of these laws  as well as the probable outcomes of any foreign or domestic tax audits 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we compute deferred income taxes using the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates  applicable to future years 
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions to the provisions for income taxes 
our most significant judgments on tax related matters include tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 
these matters involve the exercise of significant judgment which could change and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we consider the reversal of existing temporary differences  the existence of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
changes to our valuation allowance could materially impact our results of operations 
we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions connected with ongoing examinations and open tax years 
changes in our assessment of these liabilities may require us to increase the liability and record additional tax expense or reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit which would positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
we do not provide for us income taxes on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings intended to be permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
prior to december   our operations were included in a consolidated federal income tax return filed by helix 
for financial reporting purposes  our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we have completed and filed separate federal income tax returns for all periods presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how these issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
loss contingencies we accrue loss contingency reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of our liabilities are based on an evaluation of potential outcomes and currently available facts 
we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements  mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible 
actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates can be revised in the future  either negatively or positively  depending upon actual outcomes or changes in expectations based on the facts surrounding each matter 
recently issued accounting principles each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted accounting and reporting guidance applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe that any issued accounting and reporting guidance we have not yet adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in our normal business activities 
market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with existing or forecasted financial transactions 
the types of market risks to which we are exposed are credit risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
credit risk 
our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks 
our trade receivables are with a variety of us  international and foreign country national oil and natural gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require material collateral to support contractual payment obligations 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses 
interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
changes based on the floating interest rates under this facility could result in an increase or decrease in our annual interest expense and related cash outlay 
to reduce the impact of this market risk  in april we entered into a two year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to convert a portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments to fixed rate interest payments 
this interest rate swap effectively fixes our variable interest payments made on million of our variable rate term loan  or approximately as of december   at for the remaining term of the interest rate hedge 
a hypothetical increase of in quoted interest rates as of december  would increase interest expense by million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in foreign locations that subject us to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although the vast majority of our business is transacted in us dollars  we transact some business in euro dollars  mexican pesos  singapore dollars  and australian dollars  among others 
historically  foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material to our business and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
at various times  we utilize the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities  cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies 
as we continue to grow our international operations  foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant and we may mitigate our foreign curr ency risk with foreign currency derivative instruments in the future
