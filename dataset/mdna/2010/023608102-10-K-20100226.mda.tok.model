item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ameren executive summary operations at ameren s rate regulated utilities  milder weather and the economic slowdown led to a decrease in kilowatthour sales to residential and commercial customers in  compared with however  this sales decline was smaller  an estimated  on a weather normalized basis 
the weak economy also led to a decline in kilowatthour sales by ameren s rate regulated utilities to their industrial customers 
these sales declined in  compared with  excluding the impact of reduced sales to noranda s smelter plant in new madrid  missouri 
noranda s plant sustained damage because of a power interruption on non ameren owned power lines during a severe ice storm in january as a result  the smelter s load was sharply reduced but has been rising steadily as repairs have been made to the smelter plant s production lines  with full production expected to be reached in the second quarter of electric sales to industrial customers  including noranda  declined in  compared with for several years  ameren s rate regulated utility businesses have been earning returns on investment that are well below their authorized levels  in part  due to regulatory lag 
ameren is focused on improving earnings to levels that represent fair returns on its rate regulated investments 
ameren has rate cases pending in both its illinois and missouri jurisdictions 
ameren is seeking revenue levels that reflect the significant investments it has made in electric and gas utility infrastructure to improve reliability 
ameren is also seeking recovery of higher financing costs and  in missouri  rising net fuel costs 
the ameren illinois utilities are currently requesting a million aggregate annual increase in base electric and natural gas delivery rates 
the staff of the icc currently supports a million annual revenue increase 
the staff s lower revenue amount reflects its lower recommended return on equity of compared to the ameren illinois utilities request of  on a rate base weighted basis  and use of a lower pension and benefits expense level  among other things 
in february  administrative law judges issued a consolidated proposed order  which included a recommended revenue increase for electric delivery service for the ameren illinois utilities of million in the aggregate cips million increase  cilco million increase  and ip million increase and a recommended revenue net decrease for natural gas delivery service of million in the aggregate cips million increase  cilco million decrease  and ip million decrease 
the icc is not bound by the proposed order issued by the administrative law judges 
new rates should be effective by early may ue filed a request with the mopsc in july for an annual electric service rate increase of million 
more than half of the request was for anticipated higher net fuel costs 
these increased net fuel costs would have been eligible for recovery through the fac absent this filing 
the mopsc staff  in its direct testimony in the rate case  recommended an annual electric service rate increase of million to million  with approximately million of this related to higher net fuel costs 
the staff s lower revenue amount reflects its lower recommended return on equity range of to  which was lower than ue s initial request of 
the staff s revenue amount also incorporated lower depreciation  plant maintenance and financing cost levels  as well as other adjustments 
the staff testimony reflects continuation of the fac and the pension and postretirement benefit cost trackers and a modified environmental cost recovery mechanism 
other parties filed testimony in the rate case  including a group of large industrial customers and the office of public counsel 
the missouri office of public counsel recommended a return on equity of 
the large industrial customers recommended a rate increase of million  which included a million increase related to net fuel costs 
their lower revenue requirement reflects their lower recommended return on equity of  the use of significantly lower depreciation rates and plant maintenance expenses  as well as lower financing costs  among other things 
the large industrial customers testimony reflects continuation of the fac  as well as a modified approach for the accounting and recovery of environmental costs 
in february  ue filed its rebuttal testimony in this rate case  which included  among other things  a modification of its recommended return on equity to 
it is anticipated that certain major changes to revenues  expenses  rate base  and capital structure will be trued up through january   in a march ue update 
a mopsc order is expected by late may with new rates expected to be effective in late june current lower power prices are very much linked to weak economic conditions 
weak economic conditions have reduced the demand for power and other energy commodities 
ameren believes that when the economy recovers  these prices should rise 
in the meantime  ameren continues to look for opportunities to prudently reduce operating and capital spending in the merchant generation business  as well as protect and enhance margins 
ameren s merchant generation business output is significantly hedged over the next few years 
such hedging protects credit quality and reduces earnings and cash flow volatility 
in addition  ameren continues to focus on providing value added electricity products to the market 

table of contents leveraging ameren s competitive merchant generating assets  marketing company has a track record of enhancing margins through sales to wholesale and retail customers 
to strengthen merchant generation s ability to successfully weather current lower power prices  ameren has reduced planned operating and capital spending  improving the cash flow outlook for the merchant generation business 
ameren continues to evaluate merchant generation s spending plans in light of changing technologies  power prices and delivered fuel costs in order to ensure that the lowest cost options are identified in terms of both capital and ongoing operating costs 
earnings ameren reported net income of million  or per share  for compared with net income of million  or per share  in factors contributing to the cent decline in earnings per share in compared with included lower electricity and natural gas sales in ameren s rate regulated businesses and lower margins in its merchant generation business  as a result of weak economic conditions  milder weather and  in the missouri regulated business  the impact of reduced sales to noranda 
higher depreciation and interest expense  the absence in of the benefit of a lump sum payment from a coal supplier for higher fuel costs in as a result of a premature mine closure and contract termination  and an increased average number of common shares outstanding also affected comparative results 
offsetting factors included new utility rates in illinois and missouri  favorable unrealized mtm activity on derivatives  and lower operations and maintenance expenses due  in part  to the absence of a refueling and maintenance outage at the callaway nuclear plant in liquidity as a result of turmoil in the capital and credit markets in and  we sought to improve our liquidity position 
we replaced and extended the expiration of our credit facilities and sought to reduce our reliance on borrowings from these credit facilities  increase cash balances and increase the equity content of our capitalization 
we also sought to eliminate debt at cilcorp as a step in simplifying our organizational structure 
in addition  ameren also reduced planned spending  headcount and capital investment across the company to mitigate the negative impact on sales of a weak economy and related power prices 
at december   ameren  on a consolidated basis  had available liquidity  in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities  of approximately billion  which was billion more than it had at the end of cash flows from operations of billion in at ameren  along with other funds  were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of million and to fund capital expenditures of billion 
capital spending during  ameren was able to significantly defer or reduce planned capital spending  including spending for environmental compliance  compared with previous plans 
between and  ameren expects that certain ameren companies will be required to make cumulative investments of between billion and billion to retrofit their coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with existing emissions related environmental laws and regulations 
any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment is expected to be in ameren s missouri regulated operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers  but subject to prudency reviews 
initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to address global climate change are subject to active consideration in the us congress 
although we cannot predict the date of enactment or the requirements of any future climate change legislation or regulations  we believe it is possible that some form of federal legislation or regulations to control emissions of greenhouse gases will become law during president obama s administration 
potential impacts from the climate change legislation could vary depending upon proposed co emission limits  the timing of implementation of those limits  the method of distributing allowances  the degree to which offsets are allowed and available  and provisions for cost containment measures 
future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  which  in turn  could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs 
moreover  to the extent ameren requests recovery of these costs through rates  its regulators might deny some or all of  or defer timely recovery of  these costs 
excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force ue  genco  cilco through aerg and eei and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities  and it could lead to possible impairment of assets and reduced revenues 
as a result  mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on ameren s  ue s  genco s  cilco s through aerg and eei s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

for operating cash flows  genco and aerg rely on power sales to marketing company  which sold power through financial contracts that were part of the illinois electric settlement agreement and various power procurement processes in the non rate regulated illinois market 
marketing company also sells power through other primarily market based contracts with wholesale and retail customers 
in addition to cash flows from operating activities  the ameren companies use available cash  credit facilities  money pool  or other short term borrowings from affiliates to support normal operations and other temporary capital requirements 
the use of operating cash flows and credit facility or short term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other investments may periodically result in a working capital deficit  as was the case at december   for genco and cilco 
the ameren companies may reduce their credit facility or short term borrowings with cash from operations or discretionarily with long term borrowings  or in the case of ameren subsidiaries  with equity infusions from ameren 
the ameren companies expect to incur significant capital expenditures over the next five years as they comply with environmental regulations and make significant investments in their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to improve overall system reliability 
ameren intends to finance those capital expenditures and investments with a blend of equity and debt so that it maintains a capital structure in its rate regulated businesses  of approximately to equity 
we plan to implement our long term financing plans for debt  equity  or equity linked securities in order to finance our operations appropriately  meet scheduled debt maturities  and maintain financial strength and flexibility

cilco s aerg estimate includes capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental regulations at its generating facilities 
we continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs 
as a result  we could modify our plan for generation capacity  which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio  the type of generation asset technology that will be employed  and whether capacity or power may be purchased  among other things 
any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred  which could be material 
environmental capital expenditures ameren  ue  genco  aerg and eei will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing federal epa and state regulations regarding so  so and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
in may  the epa issued regulations with respect to so and so emissions the clean air interstate rule and mercury emissions the clean air mercury rule 
the federal clean air interstate rule requires generating facilities in eastern states  which include missouri and illinois  where our generating facilities are located  and the district of columbia to participate in cap and trade programs to reduce annual so 

emissions  annual nox emissions  and ozone season nox emissions 
the cap and trade program for both annual and ozone season nox emissions went into effect on january  the so 

emissions cap and trade program is scheduled to take effect in in february  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal clean air mercury rule 
the court ruled that the epa erred in the method it used to remove electric generating units from the list of sources subject to the mact requirements under the clean air act 
in february  the us supreme court denied a petition for review filed by a group representing the electric utility industry 
the impact of this decision is that the epa will move forward with a mact standard for mercury emissions and other hazardous air pollutants  such as acid gases 
in a consent order  the epa agreed to propose the regulation by march and to finalize the regulation by november compliance is expected to be required in we cannot predict at this time the estimated capital or operating costs for compliance with such future environmental rules 
in july  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal clean air interstate rule 
the court ruled that the regulation contained several fatal flaws  including a regional cap and trade program that cannot be used to facilitate the attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
in september  the epa  as well as several environmental groups  a group representing the electric utility industry  and the national mining association  all filed petitions for rehearing with the us court of appeals 
in december  the us court of appeals essentially reversed its july decision to vacate the federal clean air interstate rule 
the us court of appeals granted the epa petition for reconsideration and remanded the rule to the epa for further action to remedy the rule s flaws in accordance with the us court of appeals july opinion in the case 
the impact of the decision is that the existing illinois and missouri rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule will remain in effect until the federal clean air interstate rule is revised by the epa  at which point the illinois and missouri rules may be subject to change 
the epa has stated that it expects to issue a new proposed version of the clean air interstate rule in and a final version in the state of missouri has adopted rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule for regulating so and so emissions from electric generating units 
the rules are a significant part of missouri s plan to attain existing ambient standards for ozone and fine particulates  as well as meeting the federal clean air visibility rule 
the rules are expected to reduce no 
x 
emissions by and so emissions by by as a result of the missouri rules  ue will use allowances and install pollution control equipment 
ue s costs to comply with so emission reductions required by the clean air interstate rule could increase materially if the epa determines that existing allowances granted to sources under the acid rain program cannot be used for compliance with the clean air interstate rule  or if a new allowance program is mandated by revisions to the clean air interstate rule 
missouri also adopted rules to implement the federal 
table of contents clean air mercury rule 
however  these rules are not enforceable since the us court of appeals decision to vacate the federal clean air mercury rule 
we do not believe that the court decision that vacated the federal clean air mercury rule will significantly affect pollution control obligations in illinois in the near term 
under the mps  as amended  illinois generators may defer until the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by  in exchange for accelerated installation of nox and nox controls 
this rule  when fully implemented  is expected to reduce mercury emissions by  nox emissions by  and so emissions by by in illinois 
to comply with the rule  genco  cilco aerg and eei have begun putting into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions 
genco  cilco aerg and eei will also need to install additional pollution control equipment 
current plans include installing scrubbers for so 

reduction as well as optimizing operations of selective catalytic reduction scr systems for nox reduction at certain coal fired plants in illinois 
the illinois joint committee on administrative rules approved a rule amendment in june that revised certain requirements of the mps 
as a result  genco and cilco aerg collectively were able to defer to subsequent years an estimated million of environmental capital expenditures originally scheduled for through in march  the epa finalized regulations that will lower the ambient standard for ozone 
illinois and missouri have each submitted their recommendations to the epa for designating nonattainment areas 
a final action by the epa to designate nonattainment areas is expected in march state implementation plans will need to be submitted in unless illinois and missouri seek extensions for various requirement dates 
additional emission reductions may be required as a result of future state implementation plans 
in january  the epa announced its plans to revise the ozone standard to a level lower than the level set in at this time  we are unable to determine the impact state implementation plans for such regulations would have on our results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
the table below presents estimated capital costs that are based on current technology to comply with state air quality implementation plans  the mps  federal ambient air quality standards including ozone and fine particulates  and the federal clean air visibility rule 
the estimates shown in the table below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements  the requirements under a mact standard  new technology  variations in costs of material or labor  or alternative compliance strategies  among other factors 
the timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with any future rules  thereby deferring capital investment 
during  ameren identified significant opportunities to defer or reduce planned capital spending  which are reflected in the estimates provided in the table 
the capital cost estimates are lower than previously anticipated  in part because of ameren s ability to manage its generating fleet to minimize emissions while complying with emission limits and air permit requirements 
furthermore  previous estimates included assumptions about potential and developing air regulations  including rules that were subsequently vacated by the courts 
these estimates include capital spending to comply primarily with existing and known regulations as of december  total ue a genco aerg eei ameren a ue s expenditures are expected to be recoverable in rates over time 
in  ue developed four year and year environmental compliance plans to comply with all environmental regulations  including rules under the clean water act  to support its environmental cost recovery mechanism tariff request  which was a part of its july electric rate case filing 
the plans contain a comprehensive assessment of environmental investments likely to be required of ue

at december   the ameren companies were in compliance with their credit facility  indenture  and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants 
we consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows 
inability to raise capital on favorable terms  particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets  could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses 
after assessing our current operating performance  liquidity  and credit ratings see credit ratings below  we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets 
however  events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited 
such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets

the board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends 
however  as it has done in the past  the board of directors is expected to consider various issues  including ameren s overall payout ratio  payout ratios of our peers  projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements  historical earnings and cash flow  projected earnings  impacts of regulatory orders or legislation  and other key business considerations 
on february   the board of directors of ameren declared a quarterly dividend on ameren s common stock of cents per share  payable on march   to shareholders of record on march  certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that  among other things  restrict the ameren companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances 
at december   none of these circumstances existed at the ameren companies and  as a result  they were allowed to pay dividends 
ue would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures 
cips articles of incorporation and mortgage indentures require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus 
genco s indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold 
cilco has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock 

table of contents ue  cips  genco  cilco and ip as well as certain other nonregistrant ameren subsidiaries are subject to section a of the federal power act  which makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public utility  as defined in the federal power act  to participate in the making or paying of any dividend from any funds properly included in capital account 
the meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the federal power act or ferc regulations  however  ferc has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed  the dividends are not excessive and there is no self dealing on the part of corporate officials 
at a minimum  ameren believes that dividends can be paid by its subsidiaries that are public utilities from net income and retained earnings 
in addition  under illinois law  cips  cilco and ip may not pay any dividend on their respective stock  unless  among other things  their respective earnings and earned surplus are sufficient to declare and pay a dividend after provision is made for reasonable and proper reserves  or unless cips  cilco or ip has specific authorization from the icc

credit ratings the following table presents the principal credit ratings of the ameren companies by moody s  s p  and fitch effective on the date of this report moody s s p fitch ameren issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb bbb senior unsecured debt baa bb bbb ue issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb bbb secured debt a bbb a cips issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb bbb secured debt baa bbb bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb genco issuer corporate credit rating bbb bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb cilco issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb bbb secured debt baa bbb a ip issuer corporate credit rating baa bbb bbb secured debt baa bbb bbb moody s ratings actions on january   moody s affirmed the ratings of cips  cilco and ip and changed their rating outlooks to stable from positive 
according to moody s  the change in the rating outlooks of these three companies was based on the near term expiration of the and million 
table of contents credit facilities in january and related liquidity concerns 
moody s also on january   affirmed the ratings of ameren and ue with a stable outlook based on the january mopsc electric rate order approving a rate increase and a fac for ue 
on february   moody s affirmed the ratings of ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilco  and ip with a stable outlook 
the affirmation reflected moody s view that ameren s announcement to reduce its common dividend by was a conservative  prudent  and credit positive action that would conserve cash and support financial coverage metrics 
moody s stated that the more conservative dividend payout should also help facilitate the renewal of ameren s credit facilities that expired in they stated the dividend reduction should continue to reduce reliance on the credit facilities going forward and would likely be viewed favorably by lenders considering renewing or entering into new facilities with ameren and its subsidiaries  which was important considering constrained credit market conditions at that time 
according to moody s  the stable outlook on ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilco  and ip reflected constructive rate case outcomes at ue  cips  cilco and ip  including the approval of a fac at ue  the improving regulatory environments for investor owned utilities in illinois and missouri at that time  and moody s expectation that financial and cash flow coverage metrics should remain adequate to maintain current rating levels 
in addition  moody s noted that the dividend reduction was supportive of the stable ratings outlooks and provided ameren and its subsidiaries additional cushion at the rating levels 
on july   moody s stated that the successful execution of new two year bank credit facilities was supportive of the credit quality of ameren and its utility subsidiaries 
however  moody s did not make any changes in ameren s or its subsidiaries ratings or outlooks as a result of this action 
on august   moody s upgraded the majority of senior secured debt ratings of investment grade regulated utilities by one notch 
senior secured debt ratings at ue were upgraded from baa to a and at cips and ip from baa to baa moody s stated the rating action widened the notching between most senior secured debt ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings of investment grade regulated utilities to two notches from one previously 
moody s noted the wider notching was based on its analysis of the history of regulated utility defaults  which indicated that regulated utilities have defaulted at a lower rate and experienced lower loss given default rates than nonfinancial  nonutility corporate issuers 
on august   moody s upgraded the ratings of cips  cilco and ip 
issuer corporate credit ratings at cips  cilco and ip were upgraded from ba to baa moody s also upgraded the senior secured debt ratings at cips  cilco and ip from baa to baa moody s cited the execution of new bank credit facilities and an improved political and regulatory environment in illinois as the basis for the return to investment grade status of the issuer corporate ratings 
moody s also affirmed the ratings of ameren  ue and genco and assigned a stable outlook for ameren and all of its rated subsidiaries 
s p ratings actions on february   s p stated that it viewed the reduction in ameren s dividend as credit supportive 
s p did not make any changes in ameren s or its subsidiaries credit ratings or outlooks as a result of this action 
s p raised the business profile of ue to excellent from strong to reflect the electric rate order issued by the mopsc in january  which s p viewed as constructive 
s p lowered the business profile of cilco to satisfactory from strong 
on february   s p assigned improved business risk profiles to cips and ip of excellent from strong and to cilco of strong from satisfactory 
fitch ratings actions on february   fitch stated that the reduction in ameren s common stock dividend and other cost cutting measures would be favorable to bondholders and credit quality 
fitch did not make any changes in ameren s or its subsidiaries ratings or outlooks as a result of this action 
on march   fitch lowered the credit ratings of ue by one notch as follows issuer rating to bbb  senior secured debt to a  subordinated debt to bbb  and preferred stock to bbb 
the rating outlook was changed to stable 
fitch stated that these downgrades were made because of deteriorating financial measures over the past several years and the expectation that they will not improve materially without further rate support 
they noted the financial deterioration was primarily due to increasing fuel and operating costs and a large capital expenditure program 
on july   fitch affirmed the credit rating of genco and changed its rating outlook to negative from stable 
additionally  fitch affirmed the credit ratings of ameren with a stable outlook 
according to fitch  the change in the credit rating outlook of genco was based on the unfavorable outlook for wholesale energy prices and the sensitivity of the company s largely coal fired generating fleet to greenhouse gas and other environmental regulations 
according to fitch  the affirmation of ameren s credit ratings and stable outlook reflected the significant earnings and cash flow contribution derived from regulated utilities  the beneficial impact of recent rate increases in illinois and missouri  the savings generated by the february dividend reduction  and steps taken to maintain liquidity  including the renewal of bank credit facilities 
on january   fitch announced new guidelines that affect its ratings on deferrable coupon hybrid securities and preferred stock for utility issuers 
under these new guidelines  fitch will rate these securities two notches below the issuer s senior unsecured debt ratings 
the prior guidelines rated these securities one notch below 
the ratings for ue  cips  cilco and ip s preferred stock  and for ue s 
table of contents subordinated deferrable interest debentures  were affected by this industry wide methodology change 
collateral postings any adverse change in the ameren companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments 
such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel  power  and gas supply  among other things  resulting in a negative impact on earnings 
collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties including postings related to exchange traded contracts at december   were million  million  million  million  and million at ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip  respectively 
the amount of collateral external counterparties posted with ameren was million at december  sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings lower than bbb or baa at december   could have resulted in ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilco or ip being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments at current credit ratings 
if market prices were higher than december   levels in the next twelve months and higher thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts  then ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilco or ip could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to approximately million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
if market prices were lower than december   levels in the next twelve months and lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts  then ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilco or ip could be required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations up to approximately million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can also increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities 
it should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization 
outlook below are some key trends that may affect the ameren companies financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity in and beyond 
economy and capital and credit markets in and  global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility 
while these markets improved during  the availability and cost of capital and economic activity continue to be significantly affected 
we believe that these events have several implications for our industry as a whole  including ameren 
they include the following access to capital markets and cost of capital the extreme disruption in the capital markets limited the ability of many companies  including the ameren companies  to freely access the capital and credit markets to support their operations and to refinance debt 
ameren and its subsidiaries continued to have access to the capital markets  as evidenced by ameren s  ue s  genco s  cilco s and ip s sale of debt securities in late and  as well as ameren s common stock offering in september this access has been at commercially acceptable but higher rates in the case of the issuance of certain debt securities 
credit facilities on june   ameren and certain of its subsidiaries successfully reached definitive multiyear credit facility agreements 
these facilities cumulatively provide billion of credit through july   reducing to billion through june   and to billion through july  the costs of these credit facilities are significantly higher than the facilities they replaced 
the costs to enter into the multiyear credit facility agreements were million in the aggregate ue million  cips million  genco million  cilcorp million  cilco million  and ip million 
the costs will be amortized over the term of the facilities 
in addition  borrowing rates under the facilities increased significantly  including  in the case of ameren  from libor plus  under the prior credit facilities  to libor plus 
ameren intends to replace or extend its credit facility agreements during economic conditions weak economic conditions have resulted in reduced power prices  lower customer sales growth  or sales contraction  particularly with respect to industrial sales  and higher financing costs  among other things 
weak economic conditions also expose the ameren companies to greater risk of default by counterparties  potentially higher bad debt expenses  and the risk of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  among other things 
based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test completed as of october   the estimated fair value of ameren s merchant generation reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a nominal amount 
the failure in the future of this reporting unit  or any reporting unit  to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows or a further decline of observable industry market multiples may reduce its estimated fair value below its carrying value and would likely result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
although we are unable to predict when the us economy will fully recover from the economic downturn  we currently expect economic conditions to improve in we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the weak economy on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
investment returns the disruption in the capital markets  coupled with weak global economic conditions  adversely affected financial markets 
as a result  we 
table of contents experienced lower than expected investment returns in in our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
during  the actual return on investment of the pension plan assets was equal to the expected investment return while the actual return on investment of postretirement benefit assets exceeded the expected return 
lower returns increase our future pension and postretirement expenses and pension funding levels 
our future expenses and funding levels will also be affected by future investment returns and future discount rate levels 
operating and capital expenditures the ameren companies will continue to make significant levels of investments and incur expenditures for their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure in order to improve overall system reliability  comply with environmental regulations  and improve plant performance 
however  in response to the significant level of disruption and uncertainties in the capital and credit markets and weak economic conditions that reduced power prices and to help our customers with their future energy costs  we reduced our planned capital expenditures for through by approximately billion  as compared to earlier plans 
ameren also took steps to control operations and maintenance expenditures 
ameren is managing power plant outages and labor costs  among other things 
any expenditure control initiatives will be balanced against a continued long term commitment to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure to provide safe  reliable electric and natural gas delivery services to our customers  to meet federal and state environmental  reliability  and other regulations  and the need to maintain a solid overall liquidity and credit ratings profile to meet our operating  capital  and financing needs under challenging capital and credit market conditions 
liquidity at december   ameren  on a consolidated basis  had available liquidity  in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities  of approximately billion  which was billion more than it had at the end of we believe that our liquidity is adequate given our expected operating cash flows  capital expenditures  and related financing plans including accessing our existing credit facilities 
however  there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions  further disruptions in the capital and credit markets  or other unforeseen events will not materially affect our ability to execute our expected operating  capital or financing plans 
current capital expenditure plans between and  ameren expects to invest up to billion  in the aggregate  to retrofit its coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with emissions related environmental laws and regulations 
any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment is expected to be in our missouri regulated operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers  subject to prudency reviews 
regulatory lag may materially impact the timing of such recovery and  therefore  our cash flows and related financing needs 
the recoverability of amounts expended in merchant generation operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for coal fired generators 
future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on emissions would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs 
excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities 
investments to control emissions at ameren s coal fired power plants to comply with future legislation or regulations would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operations and maintenance expenses  which if excessive could result in the closures of coal fired power plants  impairment of assets  or otherwise materially adversely affect ameren s results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
ue continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity 
ue s integrated resource plan filed with the mopsc in february included the expectation that new baseload generation capacity would be required in the to time frame 
due to the significant time required to plan  acquire permits for  and build a baseload power plant  ue continues to study future plant alternatives  including energy efficiency programs that could help defer new plant construction 
ue introduced multiple energy efficiency programs in the goal of these and future ue energy efficiency programs is to reduce usage by megawatts by  which is the equivalent of a medium size coal fired power plant 
ue will consider all available and feasible generation options to meet future customer requirements as part of an integrated resource plan that ue will file with the mopsc in in july  ue filed an application with the nrc for a combined construction and operating license for a new  megawatt nuclear unit at ue s existing callaway county  missouri  nuclear plant site 
in june  ue requested the nrc suspend review of the cola and all activities related to the cola 
as of december   ue had capitalized approximately million as construction work in progress related to the cola 
the incurred costs will remain capitalized while management assesses all options to maximize the value of its investment in this project 
if all efforts are permanently abandoned with respect to the future construction of a new nuclear unit or management concludes it is probable the costs incurred will be disallowed in rates  it is possible that a charge to earnings could be recognized in a future period 
ue intends to submit a license extension application with the nrc to extend its existing callaway nuclear plant s 
table of contents operating license by years so that the operating license will expire in ue cannot predict whether or when the nrc will approve the license extension 
over the next few years  we expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability 
we are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures 
we expect these costs or investments at our rate regulated businesses to be ultimately recovered in rates  subject to prudency reviews by regulators  although rate case outcomes and regulatory lag could materially impact the timing of such recovery and  therefore  our cash flows  related financing needs and the timing in which we are able to proceed with these projects 
ameren is evaluating opportunities to expand its transmission assets 
new transmission projects have the potential to reduce congestion  improve reliability  and facilitate movement of renewable energy  typically generated in remote areas  to population centers where demand is at its highest 
increased investments for environmental compliance  reliability improvement  and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs 
revenues the earnings of ue  cips  cilco and ip are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies 
rising costs  including labor  material  depreciation and financing costs  coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance  are expected 
ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip anticipate regulatory lag until their requests to increase rates to recover such costs on a timely basis are granted by state regulators 
ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip expect to file rate cases frequently 
ue has agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before march  in current and future rate cases  ue  cips  cilco and ip will continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce regulatory lag 
in july  a new law became effective in illinois that allows electric and natural gas utilities to recover through a rate adjustment the difference between their actual bad debt expense and the bad debt expense included in their base rates 
in february  the icc approved the ameren illinois utilities electric and natural gas rate adjustment tariffs to recover bad debt expense not recovered in rates 
the tariffs provide utilities the ability to adjust their base rates annually through a rate adjustment mechanism that applies to and subsequent years 
the ameren illinois utilities were required to make a one time donation of million cips million  cilco million  and ip million for customer assistance programs  as required by the legislation 
the amount of the required one time donation and the impact of the recovery of and bad debt expenses were reflected in earnings 
in june  cips  cilco and ip filed requests with the icc to increase their annual revenues for electric and natural gas delivery services 
the currently pending requests  as amended  seek to increase annual revenues from electric delivery service by million in the aggregate cips million  cilco million  and ip million 
the electric rate increase requests are based on an to return on equity  a capital structure composed of to equity  an aggregate rate base for the ameren illinois utilities of billion  and a test year ended december   with certain known and measurable adjustments through may the currently pending requests  as amended  seek to increase annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by million in the aggregate cips million  cilco million  and ip million 
the natural gas rate increase requests are based on a to return on equity  a capital structure composed of to equity  an aggregate rate base for the ameren illinois utilities of billion  and a test year ended december   with certain known and measurable adjustments through may the icc staff has recommended  as amended  a net increase in revenues for electric delivery service for the ameren illinois utilities of million in the aggregate cips million increase  cilco million increase  and ip million increase and a net decrease in revenues for natural gas delivery service of million in the aggregate cilco million decrease  and ip million decrease 
the icc proceedings relating to the proposed electric and natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to months  and decisions by the icc in such proceedings are required by may ue filed a request with the mopsc in july to increase its annual revenues for electric service by million 
included in this increase request was approximately million of anticipated increases in normalized net fuel costs in excess of the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized by the mopsc in its january electric rate order  which  absent initiation of this general rate proceeding  would have been eligible for recovery through ue s existing fac 
the initial electric rate increase was based on an return on equity  a capital structure composed of equity  a rate base for ue of billion  and a test year ended march   with certain pro forma adjustments through the anticipated true up date of january  in february  ue filed rebuttal testimony relating to certain positions taken by interveners in the rate case and modified its recommended return on equity to 
the mopsc staff has recommended an increase to ue s annual revenues of between million to million 
included in this recommendation was approximately million of increases in normalized net fuel costs 
the mopsc proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 
table of contents months  and a decision by the mopsc in such proceeding is required by the end of june as part of its filing  ue also requested that the mopsc approve the implementation of an environmental cost recovery mechanism and a storm restoration cost tracker as well as the continued use of the fac and the vegetation management and infrastructural inspection cost tracking mechanism that the mopsc previously authorized in its january electric rate order 
the environmental cost recovery mechanism  if approved  would allow ue to adjust electric rates twice each year outside of general rate proceedings to reflect changes in its costs prudently incurred to comply with federal  state  or local environmental laws  regulations  or rules greater than or less than the amount set in base rates 
rate adjustments pursuant to this cost recovery mechanism would not be permitted to exceed an annual amount equal to of ue s gross jurisdictional electric revenues and would be subject to prudency reviews by the mopsc 
the storm restoration cost tracker would permit ue a more timely recovery of storm restoration operations and maintenance expenditures 
the mopsc issued an electric rate order in january approving an increase in annual electric revenues of approximately million 
new rates were effective march  in addition  pursuant to the accounting order issued by the mopsc in april  the rate order concluded that the million of operations and maintenance expenses incurred as a result of a severe ice storm in january should be amortized and recovered over a five year period starting march  the mopsc also allowed recovery of million of costs associated with a march ferc order that resettled costs among miso market participants 
ue recorded a regulatory asset for these costs at december   which are being amortized and recovered over a two year period beginning march  in its electric rate order issued in january  the mopsc approved ue s implementation of a fac and a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism 
the fac allows an adjustment of electric rates three times per year for a pass through to customers of of changes in fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system revenues  including miso costs and revenues  greater or less than the amount set in base rates  subject to mopsc prudency reviews 
the vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism provides for the tracking of expenditures that are greater or less than amounts provided for in ue s annual revenues for electric service in a particular year  subject to a limitation on increases in any one year 
the tracked amounts may be reflected in rates set in future rate cases 
even though taum sauk was not available to generate electricity for off system revenues during  ue included million in the calculation of the fac as if taum sauk had generated off system revenues 
therefore  ue s customers received the benefit of taum sauk s historical off system revenues even though the plant was not operational 
ue s earnings and cash flows from operations will increase after taum sauk becomes operational  which is expected to be in the second quarter of  since the adjustment factor will be eliminated from the fac calculation 
taum sauk is expected to increase ue s margins by million per month  when taum sauk returns to service in the second quarter of ue provides power to noranda s smelter plant in new madrid  missouri  which has historically used approximately four million megawatthours of power annually  making noranda ue s single largest customer 
as a result of a severe ice storm in january  noranda s smelter plant experienced a power outage related to non ue lines that deliver power to the substation serving the plant 
noranda stated in its annual report on form k for the year ended december   that the outage affected approximately of the smelter plant s capacity 
in a september   press release  noranda stated that its smelter plant had initiated steps to return operations to full capacity 
these steps include restarting the third of its three production lines 
the smelter plant s load has been rising steadily as repairs have been made to its production lines  with full production expected to be reached in the second quarter of as a result  ue expects its margins from sales to noranda will increase by approximately million in compared with ue s july electric rate case filing with the mopsc seeks approval to revise the tariff under which it serves noranda to prospectively address the significant lost revenues ue can incur due to any future operational issues at noranda s smelter plant like the revenue losses resulting from the january storm related power outage 
as part of the illinois electric settlement agreement  the ameren illinois utilities entered into financial contracts with marketing company for the benefit of genco and aerg  to lock in energy prices for to  megawatts annually of their round the clock power requirements during the period june   to december   at then relevant market prices 
these financial contracts do not include capacity  are not load following products  and do not involve the physical delivery of energy 
under the terms of the illinois electric settlement agreement  these financial contracts are deemed prudent  and the ameren illinois utilities are permitted full recovery of their costs in rates 
volatile power prices in the midwest can affect the amount of revenues ameren  genco  cilco through aerg and eei generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and can influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets 
spot power prices in the miso were lower in than in and should be significantly affected by any prospect of global economic recovery  among other things 
with few scheduled maintenances outages in through  the merchant generation segment expects to have available generation of million megawatthours in each year 
however  the merchant generation segment s actual generation levels will be significantly 
table of contents impacted by market prices for power in those years  among other things 
the availability and performance of genco s  aerg s and eei s electric generation fleet can materially affect their revenues 
the merchant generation segment expects to generate million megawatthours of power from its coal fired plants in genco million  aerg million  eei million based on expected power prices 
should power prices rise more than expected  the merchant generation segment has the capacity and availability to sell more generation 
the marketing strategy for the merchant generation segment is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize volatility of earnings and cash flow  while seeking to capitalize on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid  sustainable returns 
to accomplish this strategy  the merchant generation segment has established hedge targets for near term years 
through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts  marketing company targets to hedge merchant generation s expected output by to for the following year  to for two years out  and to for three years out 
as of january   marketing company had hedged approximately million megawatthours of merchant generation s expected generation  at an average price of per megawatthour 
for  marketing company had hedged approximately million megawatthours of merchant generation s forecasted generation sales at an average price of per megawatthour 
for  marketing company had hedged approximately million megawatthours of merchant generation s forecasted generation sales at an average price of per megawatthour 
marketing company has also entered into capacity only sales contracts for   and  resulting in expected capacity only revenues related to these contracts of million  million  and million  respectively 
any unhedged sales will be exposed to relevant market prices at the time of the sale 
the development of a capacity market in miso could increase the electric margins of genco  aerg and eei 
a capacity requirement obligates a load serving entity to acquire capacity sufficient to meet its obligations 
miso continues to refine its treatment of capacity supply and obligations  but development of a true capacity market could still be several years away 
current and future energy efficiency programs developed by ue  cips  cilco and ip and others could result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas transmission and distribution services 
our regulated operations will seek a regulatory framework that allows either a return on these programs or recovery of their costs 
fuel and purchased power in  of ameren s electric generation ue  genco  aerg  eei was supplied by coal fired power plants 
about of the coal used by these plants ue  genco  aerg  eei was delivered by rail from the powder river basin in wyoming 
in the past  deliveries from the powder river basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail maintenance  weather  and derailments 
as of december   coal inventories for ue  genco  aerg and eei were at targeted levels 
disruptions in coal deliveries could cause ue  genco  aerg and eei to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods  buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity  or purchasing power from other sources 
ameren s fuel costs including transportation are expected to increase in and beyond 
as of december   merchant generation s baseload hedged fuel costs  which include coal  transportation  diesel fuel surcharges  and other charges  had increased from an average cost of approximately per megawatthour in to approximately per megawatthour in  per megawatthour in  and per megawatthour in see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for through other costs in december  there was a breach of the upper reservoir at ue s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility 
this resulted in significant flooding in the local area  which damaged a state park 
ue settled with the ferc and the state of missouri all issues associated with the december taum sauk incident 
ue has property and liability insurance coverage for the taum sauk incident  subject to certain limits and deductibles 
insurance does not cover lost electric margins or penalties paid to ferc 
ue received approval from ferc to rebuild the upper reservoir at its taum sauk plant and is in the process of testing the rebuilt facility 
ue expects the taum sauk plant to become operational in the second quarter of the estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of million 
under ue s insurance policies  all claims by or against ue are subject to review by its insurance carriers 
in july  three insurance carriers filed a petition against ameren in the circuit court of st 
louis county  missouri  seeking a declaratory judgment that the property insurance policy does not require these three insurers to indemnify ameren for their share of the entire cost of construction associated with the facility rebuild design being used 
the three insurers allege that they  along with the other policy participants  presented a rebuild design that was consistent with their insurance coverage obligations and that the insurance policies do not require these insurers to pay their share of the costs of construction associated with the design being used 
these insurers have estimated a cost of approximately million for their rebuild design compared to the estimated million cost of the design approved by 
table of contents ferc and implemented by ameren 
ameren has filed an answer and counterclaim in the circuit court of st 
louis county  missouri  against these insurers 
the counterclaim asserts that the three insurance carriers have breached their obligations under the property insurance policies issued to ameren and ue 
the insurers that are parties to the litigation represent approximately  on a weighted average basis  of the property insurance policy coverage between the disputed amounts of million and million 
on august   ameren and the property insurance carriers that are not parties to the above litigation reached a settlement of any and all claims  liabilities  and obligations arising out of  or relating to  coverage under its property insurance policy  including those related to the rebuilding of the facility and the reimbursement of replacement power costs 
all payments from the settling insurance companies were received by ue in september until ameren s remaining insurance claims and the related litigation are resolved  among other things  we are unable to determine the total impact the breach could have on ameren s and ue s results of operations  financial position  and liquidity beyond those amounts already recognized 
ameren and ue expect to recover  through insurance  to of the total property insurance claim for the taum sauk incident 
beyond insurance  the recoverability of any taum sauk facility rebuild costs from customers is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in ue s november state of missouri settlement agreement 
certain costs associated with the taum sauk facility not recovered from property insurers may be recoverable from ue s electric customers through rates established in rate cases filed subsequent to the in service date of the rebuilt facility 
as of december   ue had capitalized in property and plant qualifying taum sauk related costs of million that ue believes qualify for potential recovery in electric rates under the terms of the november state of missouri settlement 
the inclusion of such costs in ue s electric rates is subject to review and approval by the mopsc in a future rate case 
any amounts not recovered through insurance  in electric rates  or otherwise  could result in charges to earnings  which could be material 
see note commitments and contingencies under part ii  item  of this report for further discussion of taum sauk matters 
ue s callaway nuclear plant s next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage in the spring of is expected to last days 
during a scheduled outage  which occurs every months  maintenance and purchased power costs increase  and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases  compared with non outage years 
over the next few years  we expect rising employee benefit costs  as well as higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience  among other things 
other a ballot initiative passed by missouri voters in november created a renewable energy portfolio requirement 
ue and other missouri investor owned utilities will be required to purchase or generate electricity from renewable energy sources equaling at least of native load sales by  with that percentage increasing in subsequent years to at least by  subject to a limit on customer rate impacts 
at least of each portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy 
compliance with the renewable energy portfolio requirement can be achieved through the procurement of renewable energy or renewable energy credits 
rules implementing the renewable energy requirement are expected to be issued by the mopsc in ue expects that any related costs or investments would ultimately be recovered in rates 
the us congress has considered legislation that would require additional government regulation of derivative and otc transactions and that would expand collateral requirements 
legislation of this nature  if finalized and signed into law by the president  could reduce the effectiveness of hedging  increasing the volatility of earnings  and could require increased collateral postings 
in  the us house of representatives and the us senate each passed its own version of healthcare reform bills that would fundamentally change the us healthcare system 
due to the uncertainty as to the final outcome of federal healthcare reform legislation  ameren is unable to estimate the effects on any reform on its results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
resources company  as part of an internal reorganization  transferred its ownership interest in eei to genco  through a capital contribution  on january  in an attempt to improve access to capital  reduce financing costs  and enhance administrative efficiencies  among other things  several internal reorganizations are being considered 
cilco is evaluating the transfer of aerg to genco  and the ameren illinois utilities are exploring a merger whereby cips  cilco and ip would become a single legal entity 
these internal reorganizations could occur in the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate our strategies to enhance our results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
these strategies may include acquisitions  divestitures  opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues  and other strategic initiatives to increase ameren s stockholder value 
we are unable to predict which  if any  of these initiatives will be executed 
the execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations  financial position  and liquidity

fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques 
we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
when we do not have observable inputs  we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk  using the best internal and external information available

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices ameren s rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the mopsc and the icc 
nonretail electric rates are regulated by ferc 
adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period 
as a result  revenue increases will lag behind changing prices 
inflation affects our operations  earnings  stockholders equity  and financial performance 
the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost 
under existing regulatory practice  only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers 
as a result  cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years 
ameren s merchant generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms and are therefore dependent on market prices for power to reflect rising costs 
as a part of the electric rate order issued by the mopsc in january  ue was granted permission to put in place  effective march   a fac 
historically  in ue s missouri electric utility jurisdiction  there was no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power 
as part of its pending electric rate case  ue requested the mopsc to approve the continued use of the fac and implementation of an environmental cost recovery mechanism 
the environmental cost recovery mechanism  if approved  would allow ue to adjust electric rates twice each year outside of general rate proceedings to reflect changes in its prudently incurred costs to comply with federal  state  or local environmental laws  regulations  or rules greater than or less than the amount set in base rates 
rate adjustments pursuant to this cost recovery mechanism would not be permitted to exceed an annual amount equal to of ue s gross jurisdictional electric revenues and would be subject to prudency reviews by the mopsc 
ue s request was consistent with the environmental cost recovery rules approved by the mopsc in april ue will not be able to implement an environmental cost recovery mechanism until so authorized by the mopsc as part of a rate case proceeding 
see note rate and regulatory matters under part ii  item  of this report for information on ue s pending electric rate case 
cips  cilco and ip recover power supply costs from electric customers by adjusting rates to accommodate changes in power prices 
ue  cips  cilco  and ip are affected by changes in the cost of electric transmission services 
ferc regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services 
each rto separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by ferc 
all members within that rto are then subjected to those rates 
as members of miso  ue s cips  cilco s and ip s transmission rates are calculated in accordance with miso s rate formula 
the transmission rate is updated in june of each year based on ferc filings 
this rate is charged directly to wholesale customers 
the ameren illinois utilities also charge this rate directly to alternative retail electric suppliers 
for the ameren illinois utilities retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier  the transmission rate is collected through a rider mechanism 
this rate is not directly charged to missouri retail customers because the mopsc includes transmission related costs in setting bundled retail rates in missouri 
in our missouri and illinois retail gas utility jurisdictions  changes in gas costs are generally reflected in billings to gas customers through pga clauses 
ue  genco  and aerg are affected by changes in market prices for natural gas to the extent that they must purchase natural gas to run cts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument  derivative or nonderivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on  or derived from  the value of some underlying asset 
the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we handle market risks in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks  principally business  legal and operational risks  are not part of the following discussion 
our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters 
our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee  which is composed of senior level ameren officers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with long term and short term variable rate debt  fixed rate debt  and auction rate long term debt 

table of contents we manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by on variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest expense net income a ameren b ue cips genco cilco ip c c a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes intercompany eliminations 
c less than million 
the estimated changes above do not consider the potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
exchange traded contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the respective exchanges and have nominal credit risk 
in all other transactions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction 
see note derivative financial instruments under part ii  item  of this report for information on the potential loss on counterparty exposure as of december  our revenues are primarily derived from sales or delivery of electricity and natural gas to customers in missouri and illinois 
our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures 
the risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base 
at december   no nonaffiliated customer represented more than  in the aggregate  of our accounts receivable 
the risk associated with the ameren illinois utilities electric and natural gas trade receivables is also mitigated by a rate adjustment mechanism that allows the ameren illinois utilities to recover the difference between their actual bad debt expense and the bad debt expense included in their base rates 
ue and the ameren illinois utilities continue to monitor the impact of increasing rates and a weak economic environment on customer collections 
ue and the ameren illinois utilities make adjustments to their allowance for doubtful accounts as deemed necessary to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances 
ue  cips  genco  cilco  aerg  ip  afs and marketing company may have credit exposure associated with interchange or wholesale purchase and sale activity with nonaffiliated companies 
at december   ue s  cips  genco s  cilco s  aerg s  ip s  afs  and marketing company s combined credit exposure to nonaffiliated non investment grade trading counterparties was million  net of collateral less than million 
we establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program 
it involves daily exposure reporting to senior management  master trading and netting agreements  and credit support  such as letters of credit and parental guarantees 
we also analyze each counterparty s financial condition before we enter into sales  forwards  swaps  futures or option contracts  and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged lease 
we estimate our credit exposure to miso associated with the miso energy and operating reserves market to be million at december  million 
equity price risk our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  including the rate of return on plan assets 
ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in erisa 
ameren s goal is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to provide the benefits at the time they are payable and also to maximize total return on plan assets and minimize expense volatility consistent with its tolerance for risk 
ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class 
where appropriate  ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types 
ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines 
the expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio 
projected rates of return for each asset class were estimated after an analysis of historical experience  future expectations  and the volatility of the various asset classes 
after considering the target asset allocation for each asset class  we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets 
in future years  the costs of such plans reflected in net income  oci  or regulatory assets  and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially  without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of 
ue also maintains a trust fund  as required by the nrc and missouri law  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   this fund was 
table of contents invested primarily in domestic equity securities and debt securities 
it totaled million million 
by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  ue seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
the debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ue actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options 
ue s exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated  because ue is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs  which would include unfavorable investment results  through electric rates 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity  emission allowances  fuel  and natural gas 
ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements 
genco  aerg and eei also seek to sell power forward to wholesale  municipal  and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices 
we also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies  which include forward hedging programs  and the use of derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts  and financial swap contracts 
however  a portion of the generation capacity of ue  genco  aerg and eei is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices 
the following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by on unhedged economic generation for through net income a ameren b ue genco cilco aerg eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations 
ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns 
due to our physical presence in the market  we are able to identify and pursue opportunities  which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities 
all of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process 
we establish value at risk var and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact 
we manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation using techniques similar to those used to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity 
most ue  genco and aerg fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts 
genco  aerg and eei do not have the ability to pass through higher fuel costs to their customers for electric operations 
prior to march  ue did not have this ability either except through a general rate proceeding 
as a part of the january mopsc electric rate order  ue was granted permission to put a fac in place  which became effective march  ue remains exposed to of changes in its fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system revenues 
ue  genco  aerg and eei have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices 
the coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility 
price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures  whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year 
ue  genco  aerg and eei generally purchase coal up to five years in advance  but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions 
the strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions 
transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs 
ue  genco  aerg and eei typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility 
natural gas transportation expenses for ameren s gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of ue  genco  aerg and eei are regulated by ferc through approved tariffs governing the rates  terms  and conditions of transportation and storage services 
certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the ameren companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term 
depending on our competitive position  we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements 

table of contents the following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants  nuclear fuel for ue s callaway nuclear plant  natural gas for our cts  and retail distribution  as appropriate  and purchased power needs of cips  cilco and ip  which own no generation  that are price hedged over the five year period through  as of december  the projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand for our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services  generation output  and inventory levels  among other matters

table of contents the following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period through coal transportation fuel expense net income a fuel expense net income a ameren b ue genco cilco eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries 
in addition  coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges 
if diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by gallon  ameren s fuel expense could increase or decrease by million annually ue million  genco million  aerg million and eei million 
as of december   ameren had a price cap for approximately of expected fuel surcharges in in the event of a significant change in coal prices  ue  genco  aerg and eei would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources 
with regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel  ue has both fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements 
it also uses inventories that provide some price hedge to fulfill its callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium  conversion  enrichment  and fabrication services 
there is no fuel reloading scheduled for ue has price hedges for of the to nuclear fuel requirements 
nuclear fuel market prices remain subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment 
ue has continued to follow a strategy of managing its inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge 
new long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor 
new long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component 
ue expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the callaway nuclear plant  at prices that cannot now be accurately predicted 
unlike the electricity and natural gas markets  nuclear fuel markets have limited financial instruments available for price hedging  so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts  if they are available 
with regard to the electric generating operations for ue  genco and aerg that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run cts  the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs 
we optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins 
through the market allocation process  ue  cips  genco  cilco and ip have been granted ftrs associated with the miso energy and operating reserves market 
in addition  marketing company has acquired ftrs for its participation in the pjm northern illinois market 
the ftrs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical electricity business 
depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid  ftrs could result in either charges or credits 
complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which ftrs to nominate in the ftr allocation process 
there is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of ftrs needed  and there is the potential that the ftrs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges 
with regard to ue s  cips  cilco s and ip s electric and natural gas distribution businesses  exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place 
these cost recovery mechanisms allow ue  cips  cilco and ip to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred fuel  purchased power and gas supply costs 
ue s  cips  cilco s and ip s strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers 
the effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated 
however  procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier  as well as the management of physical assets 
with regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities  ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability

fair value of contracts we use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas  coal  diesel  electricity  uranium  and emission allowances 
such price fluctuations may cause the following an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sale prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices  market values of coal  natural gas  and uranium inventories or emission allowances that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory  and actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays 

table of contents the derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts  futures  options  and swaps 
our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required 
the goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements 
contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially  settled by physical delivery  or net settled with the counterparty 
see note derivative financial instruments under part ii  item  of this report for additional information
