item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this section also contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the section of this report titled disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
business and industry overview ciber provides it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies and fortune and middle market companies across most major industries 
from offices located throughout the united states and europe  as well as eastern asia  australia and new zealand  we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
our reportable segments are our operating divisions  which are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
in  we made several changes to our divisions in order to better align our operations  reduce overhead costs and to separate our growing it outsourcing practice into its own division 
all prior year segment data has been adjusted to conform to the presentation 
our divisions now consist of our international division formerly europe  which includes europe  eastern asia  australia and new zealand  and our custom solutions  it outsourcing  federal and us erp formerly enterprise solutions divisions 
our international division provides a broad range of it consulting services  including package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services  with sap related solutions and services accounting for to of its total revenue in our custom solutions and federal divisions provide it services and products in custom developed software environments 
our india based operations are considered part of our custom solutions division 
our it outsourcing division offers a set of solutions that span the entire spectrum of it infrastructure and it operations services 
our us erp division primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp software from software vendors such as oracle  sap and lawson for us customers 
we recognize the majority of our services revenue under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract  while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue are primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour and changes in contract mix 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie  hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our custom solutions and federal divisions typically around to as compared to our international and us erp divisions typically around to 
with time and materials contracts  higher consultant utilization results in increased revenue  however  with fixed price contracts  it may result in higher costs and lower gross profit margins because our revenue is fixed 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our typical time and materials hourly rates range from to per hour and  on average  are generally highest in our us erp division and lowest in our federal division 
we also have fixed price projects  as well as engagements whose pricing is based on cost plus or level of effort 
for such projects  where our revenue is not directly based on hours incurred  our realized rate per hour will vary significantly depending on success or overages on such projects 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of revenue vary by business segment 
close to of our overall sg a expenses are typically for personnel costs for our branch office personnel  which includes our branch management  consulting staff management  sales and recruiting personnel and administrative staff  as well as our corporate office support staff and management personnel 
although these costs are not immediately affected by changes in revenue  there is often a relatively short term correlation between these sg a salary expenses and revenue 
additionally  as we bid on larger and longer projects  the sales cycle and related sales costs have been increasing 
as a result of the above  we analyze changes in our sg a expenses in terms of the relationship between these costs and revenue expressed as a percentage of revenue rather than total dollars or percentage change in the total dollars 

table of contents other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
the gross profit margin on consolidated other revenues is typically in the range of to 
this is a blend of low margin hardware sales typically a to gross margin  mid margin software sales typically a to gross margin and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit margin on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technological advancement and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
our international division comprised over one third of our total revenues in both and  up from of consolidated revenues in our international division operates primarily in western europe  but also has offices in china  russia  australia and new zealand 
as such  these operations transact business in local currencies of the countries in which they operate 
generally in recent years  approximately to of our international division s revenue has been denominated in euro s  approximately to has been denominated in great britain pounds gbp and the balance has come from a number of other currencies 
changes in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
for financial reporting purposes  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates at period end and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
retroactive accounting pronouncement adjustments in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance on convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
this guidance requires that the proceeds from the issuance of certain convertible debt instruments be allocated between a liability component issued at a discount and the embedded conversion option ie  the equity component in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the difference between the principal amount of the debt and the amount of the proceeds allocated to the liability component must be reported as a debt discount and subsequently amortized to earnings as additional non cash interest expense over the convertible debt s expected life using the effective interest method 
we adopted this guidance  which requires retrospective application for all periods presented  on january  the adoption changed the historical accounting treatment for our convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures even though all of our debentures were repurchased and retired prior to december  in december  the fasb issued accounting guidance contained within asc  consolidation  regarding noncontrolling interests 
this guidance requires that the noncontrolling interests in the equity of a subsidiary be accounted for and reported as equity  provides revised guidance on the treatment of net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary and requires additional disclosures that identify and distinguish between the interest of the controlling and noncontrolling owners 
we prospectively adopted these requirements on january   except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the required retrospective applications of the above guidance had the following impact on our net income  diluted earnings per share and presentation of the consolidated statement of operations for the and annual periods net income ciber  inc  as previously reported impact of convertible debenture adjustment net income ciber  inc  as adjusted net income noncontrolling interests consolidated net income earnings per share basic and diluted net income ciber  inc  as previously reported impact of convertible debenture adjustment net income ciber  inc  as adjusted 
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated we translate the results of our foreign operations into us dollars from the relevant local currencies 
in periods when the us dollar is weaker  this results in a proportionately larger number of us dollars  and thus helps our results 
in us dollar terms  currency rates were favorable for ciber during the first quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we saw significant declines in foreign exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
the strength of the us dollar remained fairly consistent throughout the first half of  only to weaken against foreign currencies during the second half of the year  making for a more favorable currency environment for ciber once again by the end of as compared to the end of the foreign exchange rates used for translating the balance sheet of our foreign operations at december   increased by for the euro and for the gbp as compared to december  the negative impact on our financial results related to the strength of the us dollar during the first half of was partially offset by a weaker us dollar in the second half of the year  resulting in an overall decrease in revenue of approximately million in the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands  except billing rate consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses operating income net income ciber  inc consultant utilization average billable headcount revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  for compared to poor economic conditions and the strength of the us dollar against many currencies between the comparable periods are primarily responsible for the decline 
foreign currency rate changes resulted in a reduction in reported revenue of approximately million  or  compared with excluding the unfavorable currency translation effects  our total revenue decreased for compared to the global economic downturn  which began late in  has led to lower overall demand for it services and products 
over much of the period from late and throughout most of  many of our clients and prospects have been focused on initiatives to deliver near and medium term cost savings  and while they continue to exercise caution in launching new it projects  especially larger ones  we are engaging in more conversations with our clients and prospects about possible projects relating to their future growth 
many clients and prospects have reduced  delayed or cancelled it spending over this same time period 
we have also experienced pricing pressures from existing clients and prospects that have been working hard to manage their costs  but we have recently seen a slowing in the frequency of pricing pressure from existing customers 
the pricing environment for new work  however  continues to be very competitive 
revenue by segment division was as follows year ended december  change in thousands custom solutions international it outsourcing federal us erp corporate inter segment n m total revenue n m not meaningful 
table of contents custom solutions revenue decreased primarily due to the successful completion of the very large pennsylvania turnpike commission ptc project in mid  plus the normal completion of other projects  as well as a number of cancelled or delayed projects and staffing reductions on other projects resulting from current economic conditions 
most significantly  some large clients cut back on the use of our services in due to strategy decisions 
we have been unable to close sufficient new contracts  especially larger ones  to offset these reductions 
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations accounted for a decline in our international division s current year results 
excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation  our international division revenue decreased by approximately 
completed projects and delays in customer decisions on new projects slowed revenue contributions in client bankruptcy and financial constraints also caused cancellation of  or reductions in some client contracts which negatively impacted this division s results 
it outsourcing revenue increased in due to account growth at existing customers  plus the addition of several new clients in late and in  all of which combined more than offset a client bankruptcy  cancelled project and reduced scope and spending at several other clients 
federal division revenue was down in as compared to related to expired contracts that have yet to be replaced 
federal had a large contract that expired at the end of and was then awarded to a qualified small business 
the federal division was successful in at winning a number of its expiring contracts where we were eligible to recompete  but delays in new contract awards have continued to push out improvements in our federal division s revenue 
recently  the federal division obtained a number of multiple award contract vehicles that allow us to compete for new business 
the federal division is working on winning task order awards under these indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts that we expect will lead to additional revenue in future periods 
us erp division revenues improved over in compared with several large contract wins in late and early in our oracle and sap practices were primarily responsible for the increase 
partially offsetting these contributions was the successful completion of the implementation phase of the very large ptc project mentioned above in mid we continue to provide support services to the ptc  but at considerably less revenue than during the implementation phase 
additionally  our technology solutions group incurred a million reduction in current year revenue due to slower hardware sales related to the weak economy 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased basis points to for  compared with for gross profit margin on consulting services revenue accounted for all of the decrease  with sizable consulting services margin decreases in all but our us erp division  which had a significant improvement over due to the turnaround in our sap practice from its poor performance in the significant declines in consulting services gross margins were primarily due to pricing pressures  which has reduced pricing on our existing work  as well as lowered pricing for new competitive awards 
as customers have reduced  delayed or cancelled projects  it has been difficult to maintain our normal levels of consultant utilization  which has also contributed to the reduction in our gross margin 
our international division also incurred an approximate employee wage increase at the beginning of that we were not able to recover through increased billing rates due to the pricing pressures mentioned above 
selling  general and administrative 
we began a number of cost reduction initiatives in the fall of in response to the deteriorating economic conditions 
as a result  our sg a costs for declined by million  or  compared with as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses were down basis points between the comparable annual periods 
significant cost reductions resulted from the combination of our former commercial and state local government divisions in  however  reductions were made in all divisions other than it outsourcing  which experienced increases in sg a costs primarily related to additional infrastructure to support revenue growth within that division 
overall  salary reductions represented approximately half of the annual sg a costs savings  and the remainder was achieved primarily through reductions in a number of other categories such as recruiting  training and meeting expenses and travel costs  in addition to a million decrease in bad debt expense  primarily from fewer client bankruptcies in compared to the prior year 
operating income 
the basis point reduction in our gross profit margin  partially offset by a basis point savings in our sg a costs  resulted in a decrease in our operating income margin to for  compared to for 
table of contents operating income by segment division was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands custom solutions international it outsourcing federal us erp corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income divisions calculated as a of division revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue custom solutions operating income decreased due to a substantial reduction in consulting services gross margin resulting primarily from higher margin projects that ended or were cancelled and downward pricing pressure from both existing customers and new clients 
in addition  some lower margin  fixed price projects also contributed to the margin decrease 
additionally  although sg a expenses decreased million in this division between the comparable years as we successfully reduced direct and overhead labor costs  we could not adjust these costs as quickly as our revenue was adjusting downward 
therefore  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased between the comparable periods  in part due to labor costs not reducing quickly enough  as well as increased costs for bad debt expense and higher rent expense in india 
operating income for our international division declined due to the significant reduction in services gross profit margins stemming from lower consultant utilization and increased consultant wages  as well as some customer induced pricing pressures 
a considerable reduction in sg a expenses due to lower overhead personnel cost  plus lower recruiting and travel expenses  as well as reduced bad debt expense helped to partially offset the gross margin decline 
it outsourcing operating loss increased due to both a reduction in consulting services gross profit margin  as well as an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue 
this division had some fixed cost utilization issues following a late  large customer bankruptcy that prevented it from reducing its costs when the related revenue was lost 
additional infrastructure costs to accommodate future revenue growth caused most of the increase in sg a costs 
federal s operating income was down due to the erosion of gross profit margin as revenues and consultant utilization have decreased and new and re compete projects are priced at lower margins than the projects they are replacing due to competitive market conditions 
additionally  the division has not been able to fully offset its decreased revenue with reductions in costs as it continues to build the infrastructure required to compete for major prime contracts 
the us erp division had significantly improved operating income in over related to improvements in both consulting services gross profit margin and reduced sg a expenses in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
the gross profit margin increase was led by a significant turnaround in our sap practice related to improved consultant utilization  cost reductions and completion of a large  low margin fixed price contract 
corporate expenses decreased as primarily salary related cost cutting measures were partially offset by significantly increased expenses related to the million paid in the third quarter to settle a lawsuit  including attorney fees  as well as increased share based compensation expenses and increased costs related to our new corporate headquarters 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million during  compared to  million of which related to the restatement of interest expense due to our january  adoption of fasb s new accounting guidance for our convertible debt  which was retired by december  the remaining decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings during and  to a lesser extent  due to lower average interest rates 

table of contents other income expense  net 
other income  net was million in  compared to other expense  net of million in our foreign exchange transaction gains losses accounted for a million improvement between the comparable periods 
offsetting the improvement from foreign exchange results was a million gain on the retirement of our debentures during with no similar gain in income taxes 
our effective tax rate increased to for  compared to for  primarily due to additional us taxes of approximately million on a one time repatriation of cash to the us the us federal research and experimentation tax credit expired on december   and unless it is extended  it will negatively impact our tax rate in future years 
comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated in us dollar terms  currency rates were favorable for ciber during the first quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we saw significant declines in foreign exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
the balance sheet rates at december   declined by for the euro and for the gbp as compared to this had a significant impact on our reported balance sheet year over year 
despite the significant decline in exchange rates vs 
the us dollar in the fourth quarter  our weighted average exchange rates for the year increased by approximately over  resulting in approximately million of additional revenue in the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands  except billing rate consulting services other revenue total revenue gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses operating income net income ciber  inc consultant utilization average billable headcount revenue 
total revenue for increased compared to total revenue for we are a global company  therefore  our revenue is denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the us dollar weakened in the first half of and strengthened during the last half of against many currencies  however  overall the us dollar was weaker against many currencies during as compared to  resulting in favorable currency translation and greater reported us dollar revenues in the current year 
foreign currency rate changes resulted in approximately million  or almost  of additional reported revenue in over additionally  small acquisitions completed in both our us erp and international divisions contributed incremental revenue of approximately million to results 
excluding the favorable currency translation effects and the incremental revenue from acquisitions  our total revenue for increased from total revenue reported for  primarily due to increased sap software related services in our international division  as well as increased consulting services revenue in our custom solutions and it outsourcing divisions 
our results  most notably in the fourth quarter  were adversely affected by the worsening global economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to experience client reductions in the use of our services  as well as clients delaying starts on new projects and seeking price reductions 
additionally  billable headcount was down to approximately  at december   as compared to our average billable headcount of  for the fiscal year and compared to  as of december  
table of contents revenue by segment division was as follows year ended december  change in thousands custom solutions international it outsourcing federal us erp corporate inter segment n m total revenue n m not meaningful custom solutions revenue increased in mainly due to several sizable contract wins  additional work on other existing contracts and improved productivity 
the performance of our international division during represented its best revenue results to date 
in  our international division represented approximately of our consolidated revenue  up from of consolidated revenue in these results were in part due to approximately million related to favorable foreign currency fluctuations  as well as approximately million of incremental revenue from several small acquisitions in late and the first half of excluding these items  our international division grew approximately resulting from continued strong sales of sap implementation services in almost all of our major operating territories  as well as many of our smaller territories 
despite the strong revenue growth of  the international division slowed in the fourth quarter of due to the deteriorating economic environment  including two client bankruptcies in and strength in the us dollar against a number of currencies 
it outsourcing division revenue increased primarily due to new contracts  although account growth at existing clients also contributed 
federal revenue declined mainly due to the expiration of one of our larger  long term contracts that was subsequently awarded to a qualified small business 
ciber has similarly lost several contracts in recent years because we do not qualify as a small business  therefore  we have been precluded from bidding on the renewal business 
we initially obtained these contracts through acquisitions of qualified small businesses that were originally awarded these contracts 
we submitted proposals on a number of projects in where we would serve as either the prime contractor or a subcontractor  but the deteriorating economic environment delayed decisions to award and start projects funded by the federal government  thus  we were unsuccessful in replacing our expired contracts 
the federal division did have a high number of contract renewals during  of which a sizable majority was won 
included in the us erp division revenue for is approximately million of incremental revenue associated with an acquisition completed in september excluding that acquisition  our us erp division revenue shrunk over in  compared to our us sap practice had a particularly challenging year as its revenue decreased by million  or  compared to this decrease was partially offset by revenue growth in our oracle higher education and lawson practices 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin improved basis points to for compared to for gross profit margin on consulting services revenue  which grew by basis points  accounted for the increase 
strong consulting services margin improvements in our custom solutions and federal divisions were responsible 
an increased focus on the pursuit of higher margin business  project pricing and delivery improvement has helped to achieve these results 
our international division experienced a decrease in its services gross profit margin in due to a shift in the mix of its service offerings toward longer  fixed term contracts that are more secure yet earn lower gross margins 
the us erp division had a substantial decrease in its services gross margin for  related to several large completed projects that have not yet been successfully replaced  resulting in poor consultant utilization during the year 
in addition  the margins in the us erp division were hurt by several lower margin fixed price projects 
in  margins on other revenue have declined to from for related to profit margins being squeezed by hardware and software manufacturers 
our custom solutions and international divisions are our largest segments  therefore  changes in their margins tend to greatly 
table of contents dictate our consolidated results 
for  margin gains in our custom solutions division were mostly offset by international s gross margin decreases  resulting in a slight improvement in gross margin over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses increased to for compared to for over basis points of the increase can be attributed to a million increase in our provision for doubtful receivables between and the remaining basis points related primarily to increased costs in the us erp and federal divisions 
the us erp division s sg a costs increased due to infrastructure and sales related costs from a mid acquisition 
federal s sg a costs increased due to costs incurred to further our ability to bid on large projects as a prime contractor 
all of the above were partially offset by international s continuing efforts to drive down its relative sg a spending  despite increased bad debt costs during operating income 
as a result of the increased sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue  our operating income decreased basis points to for compared to for operating income by segment division was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands custom solutions international it outsourcing federal us erp corporate expenses total amortization of intangibles operating income divisions calculated as a of division revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue custom solutions operating income percentage increased due to the division making a strong improvement in gross profit margin on services revenue  which was due to better pricing on newer engagements  as well as efficient staff utilization 
the gross profit margin improvement was partially offset by increased sg a costs as a percentage of revenue related to salaries for delivery infrastructure enhancements and increased recruiting costs 
international s operating income improved primarily due to a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue that was attained from operating leverage achieved on higher revenue volumes and reduced overhead personnel costs as a percentage of sales  which were partially offset by higher bad debt expenses 
the improvement in sg a as a percentage of revenue was partially offset by decreased gross profit margins due to a shift in product mix 
our international division had fewer high margin software sales in  as well as increased revenues from lower margin  long term outsourcing contracts and increased costs to build additional outsourcing infrastructure 
it outsourcing division operating income significantly decreased related to a decrease in the gross profit margin on consulting services  as well as increased sg a costs as a percentage of revenue 
some of the impact was due to adding to the data center facilities and infrastructure costs to position the division for future growth  as well as increased travel costs associated with the division s new global delivery model and bad debt expense related a client bankruptcy during the federal division s operating income was down because increased sg a expenses for operations infrastructure enhancements related to obtaining certifications for prime contractor bidding status more than offset the improvement in this division s consulting services margin 
the us erp division had operating income percentage in the current year compared to in  primarily due to several large sap projects coming to completion that had not been replaced  resulting in lower revenue and lower consultant utilization  as well as lower or negative margins on a couple of fixed price sap projects 
additionally  the division incurred increased sg a costs  some of which were due to increased infrastructure costs from a acquisition  increased sap sales costs on reduced levels of revenue and a bad debt expense resulting from client bankruptcy 
as indicated above  our us erp division was negatively impacted by 
table of contents losses in our domestic sap practice in as a result  during the second half of  we made a number of significant changes to our domestic sap practice including restructured leadership  refocused marketing and delivery efforts  as well as implementation of a number of cost reduction measures 
corporate expenses increased by million  primarily as a result of increased share based compensation costs  lower k forfeitures and increased operational support costs 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million during compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower average interest rates on our borrowings 
in late  we began to repurchase and retire our fixed rate debentures  which were completely retired by december  we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund repurchases of our fixed rate debentures 
during  our revolving credit facility interest rates  which were tied to market rates for prime and libor  also decreased 
other expense  net 
other expense  net was million in  compared to million in our foreign exchange transaction gains losses accounted for a million decrease between the comparable periods 
offsetting the decrease from foreign exchange results was a million increase in the gain on the retirement of our debentures between the comparable periods 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates decreased to for compared to for  primarily due to a higher proportion of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions 
our international division tends to have a lower effective tax rate than our domestic operations 
in addition  during our international division benefitted from lower statutory rates in several countries  as well as having profitable operations in all territories 
our foreign operations contributed of our total income before taxes for as compared to during liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  this reduction in working capital is due to accounts receivable collections  increased income tax liabilities and debt repayments 
we have used cash flows from the collection of domestic accounts receivable to reduce our long term bank debt 
beginning on december   the term loan portion of our august senior credit facility requires quarterly repayments of million  thus  million of the new senior credit facility is classified as a current liability 
historically  we have used our operating cash flow and borrowings  as well as periodic sales of our common stock to finance ongoing operations and business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow and our available senior credit facility will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through the next year 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december   compared to a balance of million at december  typically  most of our cash balance is maintained by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic cash balances are used daily to reduce our outstanding balance on our senior credit facility 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities in was down approximately million compared with  mainly due to decreased net income  net of decreases in our bad debt provision and non cash interest on our debentures  related to our restatements of and for new accounting treatment for convertible debt 
changes in normal short term working capital items like accounts receivable  especially domestic accounts receivable  accrued and other liabilities and income taxes  offset our reduced net income 
our working capital fluctuates based on seasonal factors  as well as the timing of our domestic payroll and accounts payable processing cycles in regard to month end dates 
the primary reason for significantly reduced cash flows from operating activities in was related to reduced accounts receivable collections in europe at the end of the year with a number of expected client payments slipping into early 
table of contents total accounts receivable decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to decreased revenues 
our total accounts receivable day s sales outstanding dso was days at december   compared to days at december  the overall reduction was achieved as a result of day reductions in both our domestic and international division dso 
our international division typically experiences their lowest dso levels in december 
changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the city of new orleans the city was approximately million at december   down from million at december  of our outstanding receivable balance from the city at december   a significant portion still relates to work performed following the hurricane disaster 
the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
we continue to work with the city and fema on the remaining balance and based on our communications with them  we believe we will be able to collect the balance in full 
accrued compensation and related liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december  these balances are subject to the effects from the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle  however  at december   there were days of unpaid wages  compared to days of unpaid wages at december  in addition  annual bonuses are typically accrued throughout the year and paid in the first quarter of the following year  causing some fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
other accrued expenses and liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to an increase in our liability for value added taxes vat in europe  a good portion of which has been deferred related to a payment deferral plan 
investing activities 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
we used million net of million of cash acquired to acquire iteamic pvt 
ltd  a bangalore  india based it services company during  compared with million primarily for the acquisition of a norwegian sap consultancy and a noncontrolling interest in one of our european subsidiaries during  and million used for acquisitions during spending on property and equipment decreased to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
capital spending was unusually high in  as we built the infrastructure to support our it outsourcing division 
during  we sold an aircraft acquired in the novasoft ag acquisition in for million 
financing activities 
typically  our most significant financing activities consist of the borrowings and repayments on our long term bank debt 
during the year ended december   we had net payments of million  compared to net borrowings of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net payments in resulted primarily from million of cash received following the sale of our common stock  as well as the positive cash flow generated by our operating activities and the use of existing cash balances 
the net borrowings in were primarily used to retire our debentures 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for this purpose  compared to million for the year ended december   resulting in gains on retirement of debt of approximately million in and million in additional financing activity inflows consist of sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options 
the cash provided by sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and options exercised was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to payments on our long term bank debt  our other primary financing activity outflow typically includes the purchase of treasury stock 
we repurchased million of common stock into treasury during the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we also had an outflow of million related to the settlement of cross currency interest rate swaps  compared to a similar settlement outflow of million in at december   we had authorization for the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock under our current repurchase plan 
we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock subject to limitations under our senior credit facility discussed below 
senior credit facility 
on august   ciber entered into a three year senior credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and bank of america  na as administrative agent the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility replaced our previous senior secured reducing revolving credit facility and refinanced all amounts outstanding thereunder 
the credit available under the senior credit facility may be used for the working capital needs and general

the applicable margins on our prime loans and libor loans are determined by reference to our current consolidated total leverage ratio 
we are also required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility and the related loan documents provide for the payment of other specified recurring fees and expenses  including administrative agent fees  letter of credit and other fees 
we currently have two interest rate swaps 
the first interest rate swap matures on march   and effectively converts million of our borrowings under our senior credit facility from a variable rate instrument into a fixed rate instrument  plus the applicable margin 
the second interest rate swap matures on march   and effectively converts million of our borrowings under our senior credit facility from a variable rate instrument into a fixed rate instrument  plus the applicable margin 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility  including the interest swaps  was 
the terms of the senior credit facility  as amended  include among other provisions  specific limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  stock repurchases  investments  guarantees  mergers  dispositions and acquisitions  and a prohibition on the payment of any dividends 
the senior credit facility also contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum ebitda  and an asset coverage test 
a summary of these financial covenants is as follows the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio funded debt divided by ebitda may not be greater than to through december  the maximum leverage ratio reduces to to on march   and further to to on june   and then to to on june  the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda minus capital expenditures divided by the sum of tax expense plus interest expense plus scheduled funded debt payments plus any restricted payments must be not less than to on december  and march   and not less than to on june  and september   and returning to not less than to on december  and thereafter 
we must maintain twelve month ebitda of at least million through december   and million thereafter 
under the asset coverage test  the aggregate amount of loans advanced under the senior credit facility shall  at any time  not exceed an amount equal to of all of our net accounts receivable 
certain elements of these ratios are defined below funded debt includes borrowings under our senior credit facility  any other bank debt plus the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
ebitda represents the sum of net income or net loss  net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  share based compensation expense and september legal settlement costs of million  measured over the twelve month period ending as of the end of each fiscal quarter 

table of contents we are required to be in compliance with the financial covenants at the end of each calendar quarter  and we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december   with the following calculations for our financial covenant ratios consolidated total leverage ratio to maximum permitted to consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio to minimum permitted to consolidated ebitda million minimum permitted million asset coverage test million not to exceed million at december   our closest financial covenant was the minimum ebitda of million 
based on management s current estimates  we do not currently believe a covenant violation to be probable of occurring through at least december  however  given the current volatile economic conditions  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these bank covenants 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the senior credit facility 
we cannot be certain that the foregoing factors will not result in any financial covenant violation in the future and given these factors  it is possible that a financial covenant violation may occur in subsequent quarters 
if a covenant violation were to occur  we believe that we would be able to obtain a waiver or amendment from our credit group 
any such waiver or amendment would come at additional costs to ciber and such costs could be material 
we believe that other sources of credit or financing would be available to us  however  we cannot predict at this time what types of credit or financing will be available in the future or the costs of such credit or financing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any reportable off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands principal payments on long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and effective interest rates as of december   for our borrowings 
includes operating leases for all office locations  automobiles and office equipment 
at december   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million  all of which is expected to be paid after one year 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when a cash settlement with the appropriate taxing authority may occur  as such  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition ciber earns revenue primarily from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber s consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing  and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which requires management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials or fixed price 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses for travel and other out of pocket expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from managed services time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
some software license arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element 
software support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable  when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 

table of contents unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment testing 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at june  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the result of our june  annual impairment test was that no impairment was indicated 
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two step process 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed as of june   did not result in an impairment charge for any of our business units 
the forecasts utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis as part of our impairment test assume future growth in each of our reporting units during the next five years and beyond 
our federal and us erp business units had decreases in their operating income or losses in if our business units can t obtain  or we determine at a later date that we no longer expect them to obtain the projected levels of profitability  future impairment tests may result in an impairment charge 
there can be no assurances that these business units will be able to achieve our estimated levels of profitability 
we currently have goodwill of million and million recorded for our federal and us erp business units  respectively  and there was not significant excess fair value during the june annual impairment test 
the downturn in our financial results in the second half of  particularly in our custom solutions and federal business units  increases our risk of a future goodwill impairment charge if we cannot start to grow revenue and profits in these business units in in accordance with new accounting standards for fair value measurement that became effective in  we have modified our approach to the determination of the weighted average cost of capital wacc to be used in the discounted cash flow calculations of our goodwill impairment testing 
in  our wacc for each business unit ranged from to and varied primarily based on our analysis of peer group comparable companies wacc 
in our previous impairment test in december  the business unit wacc was primarily based on ciber s wacc and ranged from to 
in our process of estimating future cash flows for our business units  we have assumed a blended overall increase in revenue in and then increases ranging from to in future years 
we have assumed a perpetual growth rate after years of 
in addition  we have assumed improvement in operating income as a percentage of revenue resulting from recent changes we have made to our cost structure  improvements in operating performance and leverage of revenue growth 
in our overall evaluation of the business unit fair value determinations from our discounted cash flow analysis  we also consider a sensitivity analysis of various discount rates and growth rate assumptions 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any future impairment charge would result from the foregoing factors but  if an impairment change were to be required for any of our business units  it would likely be material 
given the significant amount of goodwill we have recorded  the deteriorated economic conditions of the industry in which we operate  including the current worldwide economic conditions impacting our customers and their use of our services  and the lack of significant excess fair value during our last impairment test  among other factors  we cannot be certain that a goodwill impairment write down will not be required during future periods 

table of contents income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction  as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of a tax benefit will not be realized as the result of an audit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the estimates of tax benefits to be realized  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectability each month 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large  credit worthy fortune companies and governments 
during  as global economic conditions worsened  we experienced an unusually high number of client bankruptcies and financial difficulties 
our bad debt expense increased to million in as compared to million in if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
at december   our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the city of new orleans the city was approximately million  down from million at december  the city continues to experience administrative complications and fema reimbursement delays  which have delayed payment for our services 
we continue to work with the city and fema on the remaining balance and based on our communications with them  we believe we will be able to collect the balance in full 
therefore  we have not provided for any reserves related to this balance at december  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in our collection efforts 
should the city s financial condition deteriorate or should other information arise in the future to indicate that we may not be paid in full  we would provide for an appropriate reserve at such time 
accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated 
table of contents loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill  if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets primarily include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to other market risks is immaterial 
during   or million of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
a portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
additionally  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency rates related to short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility were million and our weighted average interest rate was 
we currently have two interest rate swaps with financial institutions to help us manage our interest rate risk under our senior credit facility by converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
the first interest rate swap matures on march   and effectively converts million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis  plus the applicable margin 
the second interest rate swap matures on march   and effectively converts million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis  plus the applicable margin 
assuming million of outstanding borrowings  of which million is fixed rate due to the interest rate swaps  a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense
