at march   the company had an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses  including unfunded commitments of  was million  or of total loans at march  the increase in the balance of the allowance for loan losses at march  reflects the increased levels of delinquent and classified loans  deteriorating economic conditions particularly related to the real estate market and a change in loss rates when compared to march  classified assets were million at march  compared to million at march  the increase was primarily attributable to the current economic conditions affecting borrowers repayment ability 
nonperforming loans increased million during the year ended march   and specific reserves for such loans were million 
as previously noted in nonperforming assets  the increase in classified and nonperforming loans has continued to be centered in the company s land acquisition and development loan portfolio and its speculative loans portfolio 
the deterioration in the loan portfolio resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses  which were partially offset by the million in net charge offs during fiscal year all of the loans on non accrual status as of march  were categorized as classified loans 
management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio and the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
however  a further decline in local economic conditions  results of examinations by the company s regulators  or other factors could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely effect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses will be adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate or should collateral values further decline as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document

management reviews investment securities quarterly for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti  taking into consideration current market conditions  the extent and nature of changes in fair value  issuer rating changes and trends  financial condition of the underlying issuers  current analysts evaluations  the company s ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  as well as other factors 
the investment security that the company recognized a non cash impairment charge on is a trust preferred pooled security issued by other bank holding companies 
management believes it is possible that a substantial portion of the principal and interest will be received  that the company does not intend to sell this security and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell this security before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis 
at march   actual market prices  or relevant observable inputs for our trust preferred pooled security  continued to be unavailable as a result of the secondary market for trust preferred securities being restricted to a level determined to be inactive 
this determination was made considering the low number of observable transactions for trust preferred securities or similar collateral debt obligations  the significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade  the low number of new issuances for similar securities  the significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums  the lack of information that is released publicly  and from discussions management had with third party industry analysts 
consistent with previous valuations  the company determined that an income approach valuation technique using cash flows and present value techniques that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs was the most appropriate valuation technique 
management used significant unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions of what a market participant would use to price this security at march  significant unobservable inputs included selecting an appropriate discount rate  default rate and repayment assumptions 
the company estimated the discount rate by comparing rates for similarly rated corporate bonds  with additional consideration given to market liquidity 
the default rates and repayment assumptions were estimated based on the individual issuer s financial conditions  historical repayment information  as well as our future expectations of the capital markets 
using this information  the company estimated the fair value of the security at march  to be million 
additionally  the company received two independent level valuation estimates for this security 
those valuation estimates were based on proprietary pricing models utilizing significant unobservable inputs 
although the company s estimate of fair value fell within the range of valuations provided  the magnitude in the range of fair values estimates further supported the difficulty in estimating the fair value for these types securities in the current environment 
in april  accounting guidance was issued on the recognition and presentation of otti see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
to determine the component of otti related to credit losses  the company compared the amortized cost basis of the security to the present value of the revised expected cash flows  discounted using the current pre impairment yield 
the revised expected cash flow estimates were based primarily on an analysis of default rates  prepayment speeds and third party analytical reports 
in general  default rates of the underlying individual issuers has increased resulting in a decline in value of the security 
in determining the expected default rates and prepayment speeds  management evaluated  among other things  the individual issuers financial condition including capital levels  nonperforming asset amounts  loan loss reserve levels  and portfolio composition and concentrations 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded an adjustment  net of taxes  which decreased accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to increase beginning retained earnings totaling million at march  for additional information on our level fair value measurements see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of financial condition at march  and  fair value of level assets  and item a  risk factors risks related to our business other than temporary impairment charges in our investment securities portfolio could result in significant losses and cause riverview community bank to become significantly undercapitalized and adversely affect our continuing operations  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of the form k 
deposit activities and other sources of funds general 
deposits  loan repayments and loan sales are the major sources of the company s funds for lending and other investment purposes 
loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
they may also be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposit accounts 
the company attracts deposits from within its primary market area by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand deposits  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans 
historically  the company has focused on retail deposits 
expansion in commercial lending has led to growth in business deposits including demand deposit accounts 
business checking accounts have grown million to million at march  from million at march   an increase of 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of its deposit accounts  the company considers the rates offered by its competition  profitability to the company  matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns 
the company generally reviews its deposit mix and pricing weekly

deposit accounts totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the continued low interest rates have resulted in customers placing their deposits into money market accounts and certificate of deposits  which earn the highest interest rate yields 
money market and certificate of deposit accounts increased million and million  respectively at march  compared to march  the company did not have any wholesale brokered deposits at march  compared to million  or of total deposits  at march  customer branch deposit balances increased million since march  the increase in deposits resulted from a continued effort by the company to increase its core deposits 
the company continues to focus deposit growth around customer relationships as opposed to obtaining deposits through the wholesale markets 
however  the company has continued to experience increased competition for customer deposits within its market area 
overall  growth in deposits was suppressed by a decrease in the average account balances of many of our real estate related customers reflecting the slowdown of home sales and other transaction closings 
additionally  the company had million  or of total deposits  in cdars deposits  which were gathered from customers within the company s primary market area 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the ots informed the company that it was placing a restriction through a supervisory letter directive on the bank s ability to increase brokered deposits  including the bank s reciprocal cdars program  to no more than of total deposits 
at march  and  deposits from ramcorp totaled million and million  respectively 
these deposits were included in interest checking accounts and represent assets under management by ramcorp 
the reduction in these deposits was a strategic decision made by the company to reduce its overall costs of funding as these funds at the time were more costly than other deposits 
at march   the company also had million in deposits from public entities located in the state of washington  all of which were fully covered by fdic insurance or secured by pledged collateral 
deposit growth remains a key strategic focus for the company and our ability to achieve deposit growth  particularly growth in core deposits  is subject to many risk factors including the effects of competitive pricing pressures  changing customer deposit behavior  and increasing or decreasing interest rate environments 
adverse developments with respect to any of these risk factors could limit the company s ability to attract and retain deposits and could have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
