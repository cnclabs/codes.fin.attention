item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report and notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a number of risks 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  before you decide whether to purchase our common stock 
the risks set out below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible  changing the components of our assets and liabilities  and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares 
any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities 
consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition  results of operations and trading price at the present time 
we are dependent on certain key personnel 
we are dependent on the services of ian m 
cumming and joseph s 
steinberg  our chairman of the board and president  respectively 
messrs 
cumming s and steinberg s employment agreements with us expire june  these individuals are also significant shareholders of our company 
as of february   messrs 
cumming and steinberg and trusts for the benefit of their respective families excluding certain private charitable foundations beneficially owned approximately and of our outstanding common shares  respectively 
accordingly  messrs 
cumming and steinberg exert significant influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we operate in a variety of industries and market sectors  all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and are adversely affected by the current recession 
a worsening of general economic or market conditions may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments or have a negative impact on the credit quality of our assets 
the current economic recession has adversely affected operating results in the manufacturing  telecommunications  oil and gas drilling services  property management and services  gaming entertainment and domestic real estate segments  which is likely to continue until the economy recovers 
declines in the us housing market have reduced revenues and profitability of the manufacturing businesses and may continue to do so 
our manufacturing operations  in particular idaho timber  have generated significant revenues when the us housing market was strong 
the weak us housing market during the last few years has resulted in fewer new housing starts  which has adversely impacted revenues and profitability at idaho timber 
idaho timber does not expect to return to prior levels of profitability until the us housing market recovers 
the prices and availability of key raw materials affects the profitability of our manufacturing operations  and also impacts sangart s ability to conduct its clinical trials 
although the company s operating subsidiaries are not currently experiencing any shortage of raw materials  if the subsidiaries experience shortages  revenues and profitability of the manufacturing subsidiaries would decline 
sangart has access to sufficient raw materials to conduct its clinical trials  however  it has not secured commitments for sufficient raw materials for a commercial launch  which would also require additional investments in manufacturing capacity 
in addition  the cost of the principal raw material used by conwed plastics  polypropylene  has increased by approximately from  principally driven by the volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
pricing on sti prepaid s prepaid phone card business is highly sensitive to price declines and subject to intense competition 
we believe in some instances our competitors offer or appear to offer rates to consumers that are below their cost in order to gain market share 
in addition  the emergence of competition using voice over internet protocol has further increased competition and reduced prices 
the impact of lower pricing and new competitors has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and profits 
sti prepaid primarily relies on independent distributors to generate revenues  who may not devote sufficient efforts to promote and sell our products rather than the products of our competitors 
sti prepaid primarily relies on independent distributors to generate revenues 
should distributors promote other products at the expense of sti prepaid s products  revenues and profitability would decline 
resortquest s vacation rental management services revenues have been adversely impacted by current economic conditions and its real estate brokerage revenues have declined as a result of the depressed real estate development market 
poor general economic conditions have caused a decrease in resortquest s advance reservations  as its customers reduce amounts spent on discretionary items 
resortquest has had to provide discounts to customers and has exited certain unprofitable locations 
its real estate brokerage business has experienced significant declines in revenues  which reflect the depressed real estate market 
until general economic conditions and the real estate market improve  resortquest could continue to experience declines in revenues and profitability 
the hard rock biloxi is dependent upon patronage of persons living in the gulf coast region 
the hard rock biloxi primarily seeks to attract patrons from its local geographic area 
downturns in local and regional economic conditions  an increase in competition in the surrounding area and interruptions caused by hurricanes could negatively impact operating results 
increases in mortgage interest rate levels  the lack of available consumer credit and the depressed real estate market have reduced and may continue to reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects and result in impairment charges 
due to current depressed economic conditions in the national real estate market  most of the company s real estate development projects are not being marketed for sale 
if the company begins to market its development projects in the future  the ability to successfully attract customers will be highly dependent upon consumers ability to finance real estate purchases with affordable loans 
if the company is unable to realize its projected cash flows for its development projects  impairment charges are likely 
sangart is subject to extensive government regulation  cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products and is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business 
the company has invested approximately  in sangart  principally to help fund sangart s product development activities 
while these funds are generally expensed by sangart when spent  the company cannot be assured that it will ever receive a return on its investment due to the risky nature of sangart s development activities 
clinical trials of sangart s product candidates are not complete  the products have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities and there is a risk that its products may never prove effective or be approved 
there are other companies developing products for the same market that sangart is targeting  and if they are successful in bringing their product to market before sangart it may significantly impair sangart s ability to compete in the same market segment 
even if sangart is successful in obtaining regulatory approval to sell its products  competitors may receive approval prior to sangart and or have more effective products which could reduce demand for sangart s products 
sangart s success depends on its ability to obtain  maintain and defend patent protection for its products and technologies  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies  such as sangart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if sangart s intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if sangart fails to maintain its third party intellectual property licenses in good standing  its ability to successfully bring mp products to market would be adversely affected  it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
sangart will require significant additional funding for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the source of such funding has not been identified 
sangart s existing cash reserves are expected to be sufficient to fund activities into the third quarter of sangart has had discussions with third party investors  however  no agreements have been reached and if such agreements are entered into it would likely result in significant dilution of the company s interest 
the company has not determined if it will provide additional funds to sangart 
if sangart is not provided with additional funds from either the company or other sources when needed  it is unlikely that the company will ever realize a full return of its invested capital 
keen s revenues and profitability are impacted by natural gas supplies and prices and the supply of drilling rigs in the marketplace 
during periods of decreased demand for natural gas  keen s rig utilization will decline and its competitors may also have excess capacity in the marketplace  which adversely impacts keen s revenues and profitability 
although there has been recent improvement in natural gas prices  keen s profitability will not significantly improve without increased natural gas demand to sustain the rise in natural gas prices 
increased industrial demand for natural gas  which is tied to achieving economic recovery  is required to significantly improve demand 
the lack of liquidity in the capital markets has and could continue to adversely affect exploration  production and development activities of keen s customers  which causes a reduction in keen s rig utilization and profitability 
the combination of low oil and natural gas prices and the lack of liquidity in the capital markets has forced keen s customers to reduce drilling programs  impaired their ability to sustain their current level of operations and could adversely impact their ability to meet their cash obligations 
in addition to reduced rig utilization and profitability  which could result in impairment charges for certain rigs  the difficulties being experienced by keen s customers could increase keen s bad debt expense 
the nature of keen s operating activities can be hazardous  and accidents can cause personal injury or death  damage to keen s equipment and or environmental damage 
these hazards are inherent in the contract drilling business  and if keen is not fully protected through insurance coverage or indemnification from its customers any such accidents could adversely impact keen s profitability 
keen maintains insurance coverage and has indemnification agreements with many of its customers  however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements would adequately protect keen against liability or loss from all consequences of any accidents 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance can be purchased economically 
new technologies could cause keen s drilling equipment and methods to become less competitive  resulting in reduced profitability or a requirement to make significant capital investments to remain competitive 
improvements in drilling technology could cause keen to become less competitive  lose business  suffer reduced profitability or result in impairment charges to its drilling equipment 
when drilling pursuant to footage or turnkey contracts  keen could incur unexpected cost overruns which could negatively impact keen s profitability 
keen typically provides contract drilling services under daywork contracts under which keen s customers assume most of the risks associated with drilling operations 
if keen enters footage or turnkey contracts  keen is paid a fixed amount  regardless of the time required or operational problems encountered 
keen typically pays more of the out of pocket operating costs on a footage or turnkey contract versus daywork contract 
if berkadia does not maintain certain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies it could lose its mortgage servicing rights 
berkadia is required to maintain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies  and failure to do so would give its customers the right to terminate their mortgage servicing agreements 
if mortgage servicing agreements were terminated as a result of a credit ratings downgrade  the company could lose its entire equity investment and may be exposed to loss for some or all of its guaranty on the berkshire credit facility 
when berkadia originates loans for fannie mae  it is often required to share in the losses on such loans  which could be in excess of reserved amounts 
berkadia carries a reserve on its balance sheet for contingent losses on loans originated for fannie mae that have loss sharing requirements 
if actual losses exceed amounts reserved  berkadia s profitability will be reduced 
the loss of or changes in berkadia s relationships with us government sponsored enterprises gses and federal agencies would have an adverse effect on berkadia s business 
berkadia s status as an approved seller servicer for fannie mae and freddie mac and its status as an fha approved mortgagee and issuer of ginnie mae mortgage backed securities afford berkadia a number of advantages 
berkadia s failure to comply with the applicable gse or agency standards financial and otherwise may result in its termination as an approved seller servicer  mortgagee or issuer 
the loss of any such status could have a material adverse impact on berkadia s results of operations  could result in a loss of similar approvals from other gses or federal agencies and could have other adverse consequences to the business 
fannie mae and freddie mac retain broad discretion to terminate berkadia as a seller servicer without cause upon notice 
changes in existing government sponsored and federal mortgage programs could negatively affect berkadia s business 
berkadia s ability to generate income through mortgage sales to institutional investors depends in part on programs sponsored by fannie mae  freddie mac and the fha  which facilitate the issuance of mortgage backed securities in the secondary market 
these programs have been reduced in recent periods due to current economic conditions 
any discontinuation of  or significant reduction in  the operation of those programs could have a material adverse effect on berkadia s loan origination and servicing business and results of operations 
also  any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market or the underwriting criteria of these entities could negatively impact berkadia s results of operations and cash flow 
berkadia s business is significantly affected by general economic conditions  particularly in the commercial real estate industry  and could be harmed in the event of a continued prolonged economic slowdown or recession or a market downturn or disruption 
berkadia s business and earnings are sensitive to changes in government policies and regulations  changes in interest rates  inflation  deflation  oversupply of real estate properties  fluctuations in the real estate and debt capital markets and developments in national and local economies 
unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on berkadia s business  including decreasing the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third parties 
the company has a substantial investment in jefferies  an investment banking and securities firm whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets 
although jefferies operating results showed great improvement in  during  turmoil in the equity and credit markets had an adverse effect on the volume and size of transactions jefferies executed for its customers  resulting in reduced revenues and profitability in its investment banking  asset management and trading activities  as well as losses in its principal trading activities 
future declines in jefferies operating results caused by these or other conditions could adversely affect the value of the company s investment 
the company has a substantial investment in acf  a company that purchases automobile loans made to sub prime and other borrowers  whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets 
if acf s loan losses increase as its borrowers experience economic hardships  or if its ability to acquire new loans and grow its business is impaired  particularly due to the turmoil in the credit markets that acf needs to access to fund its operating activities  its revenues and profits would decline  adversely affecting the value of the company s investment 
from time to time the company may invest in illiquid securities that are subject to standstill agreements or otherwise restricted 
the company s investment in acf is subject to a standstill agreement that expires in march  and the company s investment in jefferies is subject to a standstill agreement that expires in april should the company need to generate liquidity quickly  the standstill agreements would limit the company s ability to dispose of these investments while the agreements are effective 
the company has significant investments in publicly traded securities and in entities that invest in publicly traded securities  and changes in the market prices of these securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices  can have a material impact on the company s investment portfolio  equity and  for certain investments  on results of operations 
the company has significant investments in publicly traded securities principally fortescue  jefferies  acf and inmet and in investment partnerships or other entities that invest in publicly traded securities including jhyh 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities  such as fortescue and inmet  are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and equity but not in the consolidated statement of operations 
however  changes in the market prices of investments for which the company has elected the fair value option jefferies and acf  and declines in the fair values of public and non public securities that the company deems to be other than temporary are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity 
profits or losses related to the company s share of its investments in investment partnerships or other entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in market values of these entities investments are reflected in their earnings  which increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
global securities markets have been highly volatile  and continued volatility may have a material negative impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by certain of the company s operations and investments  potentially resulting in impairment charges for long lived assets 
certain of the company s operating businesses and investments have significant investments in long lived assets  in particular manufacturing  oil and gas drilling services and gaming entertainment 
current economic conditions have resulted in declining revenues for these operations and their property and equipment is not being fully utilized 
the company has reviewed certain of these assets and investments for potential impairment  and except as otherwise disclosed has concluded that the book values of these long lived assets are recoverable 
if the operating revenues of these businesses deteriorate in the future  and or the company lowers its estimates of future cash flows  impairment charges might have to be recorded 
the company has incurred costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale energy projects  however  development of these projects is subject to obtaining significant third party debt and equity financing and regulatory approvals 
although the company has spent material amounts in the investigation of large scale energy projects  it will not be able to develop these projects without financing from other sources and various regulatory approvals 
the timing of the commencement of construction of any project is also dependent upon the receipt of financing and regulatory approvals 
if the company is unable to obtain such financing or approvals  it will not be able to recover its investment 
the company has substantial investments in fortescue  inmet and clc  entities which are engaged in the mining of base metals principally iron ore and copper  the prices of which have been volatile and can reduce the value of the company s investments 
the value of the company s investment in the base mining sector rise and fall with the changes in the underlying base metal prices 
in addition  mining operations are often subject to delay and regulatory scrutiny  which can increase costs or delay bringing mines into full production 
pricing changes and mining delays have a direct impact on the value of the company s investments  and could adversely impact results of operations and equity 
we could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses 
the company competes with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees  including entities that operate in different market sectors than the company 
costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations 
from time to time we are subject to litigation  for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined  may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company and its subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not material to the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  adverse determinations in specific legal matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our nols 
at december   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty about its ability to generate future taxable income to utilize that asset 
we may not be able to insure certain risks economically 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim

this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  related footnote disclosures and cautionary statement for forward looking information  which appear elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s investment portfolio  equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and equity 
however  changes in the market prices of investments for which the company has elected the fair value option  declines in the fair values of equity securities that the company deems to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity 
the company also has non controlling investments in entities that are engaged in investing and or securities transactions activities that are accounted for on the equity method of accounting classified as investments in associated companies  for which the company records its share of the entities profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations 
these entities typically invest in public securities  with changes in market values reflected in their earnings  which increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
the company s largest publicly traded available for sale equity securities with changes in market values reflected in other comprehensive income loss are fortescue and inmet 
during the year ended december   the market value of the company s investment in the common shares of fortescue increased from  to  and the market value of the company s investment in inmet increased from  to  the market values of the company s investments in acf and jefferies  for which the fair value option was elected  increased during the year with unrealized gains reflected in operations as a component of income related to associated companies

its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources  liquid investments  public and private capital market transactions  repayment of subsidiary advances  funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments  management and other fees  and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries  as well as dispositions of existing businesses and investments 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs 
securities classified as current and non current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents  but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time

the components of the company s operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures  the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a material impact on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period 
further  the timing and amounts of distributions from certain of the company s investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method are generally outside the control of the company 
as a result  reported cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend  and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period

the company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
if the company is unable to meet the specified ratio  the company would not be able to issue additional indebtedness or preferred stock  but the company s inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures

the above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments  if any  is uncertain 
such amounts aggregated  at december   for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to  and wiltel also maintained defined benefit pension plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of wiltel 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees referred to as the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in these plans have been frozen  future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  changes in the market value of plan assets  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates 
the company is in the process of seeking approval from various government entities to terminate the company s not wiltel s frozen defined benefit pension plan  the company anticipates it will terminate this plan in the fourth quarter of if terminated  the company expects it will have to contribute an additional  to the plan 
the company also expects to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust account for the wiltel defined benefit pension plan in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plan 
the company expects to contribute  to wiltel s defined benefit pension plan in the tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration  principally due to the availability of the company s nols to otherwise reduce taxable income 
other than these aggregate  expected contributions  the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain 
as of december   certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below dollars in thousands the company s plan wiltel s plan projected benefit obligation funded status balance sheet liability at december  deferred losses included in other comprehensive income loss discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
for the company s plan  a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis  using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants 
for the wiltel plan  the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market 
these discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in these discount rates would affect aggregate pension expense by  and the aggregate benefit obligation by  the deferred losses in other comprehensive income loss primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  for all plans 
a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to  differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material 
during  the fair value of the wiltel plan assets declined significantly due to the decline in securities markets worldwide 
this decline is the reason for the significant increase in the balance sheet liability for the wiltel plan during off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating  pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was  almost all of which expires in subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
substantially all of these letters of credit expire before as discussed above  the company has also guaranteed of the amounts outstanding under clc s intercompany loan from inmet 
at december    was outstanding under the intercompany loan  accordingly  the company s outstanding guaranty at that date was as discussed above the company has also guaranteed berkadia s repayment of of the five year credit facility issued by a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway 
at december   the amount outstanding under the facility was  accordingly  the company s outstanding guaranty at that date was  critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes at december   the company s valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset fully reserved for all of the potential future tax savings from federal nols and for a substantial portion of its state nols 
in accordance with gaap  the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of any valuation allowance recorded does not in any way adversely affect the company s ability to use its nols to offset taxable income in the future 
if in the future the company determines that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net recorded deferred tax asset  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period 
the company is required to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
generally  greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment  in particular on recent historical operating results 
during the second half of the company recorded significant unrealized losses on many of its largest investments  recognized other than temporary impairments for a number of other investments and reported reduced profitability from substantially all of its operating businesses  all of which contributed to the recognition of a pre tax loss of  in the consolidated statement of operations and a pre tax loss in other comprehensive income loss of  for the year ended december  the worldwide economic downturn has adversely affected many of the company s operating businesses and investments  and the nature of the current economic difficulties make it impossible to reliably project how long the downturn will last 
additionally  the losses recognized by the company resulted in a cumulative loss in total comprehensive income loss during the three year period ending december  in assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset at december   the company concluded that its recent operating loss and the then current economic conditions worldwide be given more weight than its projections of future taxable income during the period that it has nols available until  and be given more weight than the company s long track record of generating taxable income 
as a result  the company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset  and increased its valuation allowance in by  with a corresponding charge to income tax expense 
prior to  the company s long track record of generating taxable income  its cumulative taxable income for the then recent prior periods and its projections of future taxable income were the most heavily weighted factors considered when determining how much of the net deferred tax asset was more likely than not to be realizable 
as a result  during the company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense 
an additional  of the valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense in the company s estimate of future taxable income considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its operating businesses and investments  included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operating business and investment  estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the company estimated it would have available nols 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of its net deferred tax asset in future periods 
however  before the company would reverse any portion of its valuation allowance in excess of taxes recorded on reported income  it will need positive evidence that it has historical positive cumulative taxable income over a period of time which is likely to continue in future periods 
at that time  any decrease to the valuation allowance would be based upon the company s projections of future taxable income  which are inherently uncertain 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
one of the company s real estate subsidiaries mb is the owner and developer of a mixed use real estate project located in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the project is comprised of a retail center with approximately  square feet of retail space   square feet of office space and residential apartment rental units 
the retail center is approximately leased and the office space is approximately leased 
certain of the apartment units are allocated for long term rental units and are substantially leased  the remaining apartment units are marketed as vacation rentals 
the acquisition and construction costs were funded by capital contributed by the company and nonrecourse indebtedness with a balance of  at december   that is collateralized by the real estate 
if mb is unable to make debt service or principal payments on the loan the company is under no obligation to make those payments 
current economic conditions have adversely impacted the majority of the retail tenants at the retail center 
over retail tenants have requested reductions in rent payments  some of which have been granted  certain other tenants are not paying the full amount of rent due while their leases are being renegotiated 
during the second quarter of  mb was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan 
these events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the company to evaluate whether the carrying amount of mb s real estate asset was recoverable 
based on the assumptions discussed below the company concluded that the carrying amount was not recoverable  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  classified as selling  general and other expenses which reduced the carrying amount of mb s real estate to its fair value of  at june  the company prepared cash flow models and utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of mb s real estate 
although the retail center has a remaining useful life of years  the company prepared cash flow models assuming it would operate the retail center over periods of  or years and then sell the retail center at the end of those periods 
the most significant assumptions in the company s cash flow models were the discount rate and the capitalization rate used to estimate the selling price of the retail center  these rates were selected based on published reports of market conditions for similar properties 
the company assumed that requested reductions in rent would continue through before returning to pre abatement levels 
projected net cash flow before debt service included assumptions for vacancies  rent renewal rates  expense increases and allowances for tenant improvements for new tenants 
the company also prepared an additional model that assumed the bank lenders foreclose on their loan and take title to mb s real estate 
although the company would not receive any cash flow in the event the lenders foreclose on the mortgaged property  since the company s debt obligation of  is without recourse to the company  the impairment loss would be limited to the excess  if any  of the book value of the real estate over the debt obligation 
the company calculated the fair value of mb s real estate by probability weighting the present values of the various possible outcomes 
the cash flow projections assume some recovery in the local and national economy over the next few years 
if economic conditions do not improve and the bank lenders do not foreclose  it is possible that mb will have to continue to provide rent reductions for its properties which could result in further impairment charges to the carrying value of the real estate 
although mb s bank loan matured in october  it was not repaid since mb did not have sufficient funds and the company is under no obligation and has no intention to provide the funds to mb to pay off the loan 
mb received an additional default notice for failure to repay the bank loan but its lenders have not commenced foreclosure proceedings 
if mb s bank lenders foreclose in the future  the company would record a gain equal to the excess of the loan balance over the then book value of the real estate 
at december   the carrying value of mb s real estate was  in addition to the mb impairment  during the company recorded impairment losses on long lived assets aggregating  classified as selling  general and other expenses 
of this amount   related to its manufacturing segment primarily idaho timber and  related to its real estate segment 
during  idaho timber discontinued remanufacturing of dimension lumber and experienced declining sales of certain specialty wood products at one of its plants  and as a result decided to close the plant 
idaho timber evaluated for impairment the plant s long lived assets  comprised of buildings  machinery and equipment  and customer relationships intangibles 
the carrying values of long lived assets held and used and intangible assets were written down to their fair values  determined using the present value of expected future cash flows 
the company wrote down certain real estate properties that are held for sale for which the fair values were primarily based on appraisals or prices for similar assets 
the company also wrote down a real estate property that under gaap is considered to be held and used  but which the company has recently decided to sell 
the company wrote down this real estate property to fair value primarily using market information for similar assets 
during  the company recorded impairment losses on long lived assets aggregating  of which  related to its gaming entertainment segment   related to its real estate segment and  related to its other operations segment 
there were no impairment losses recorded during current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the company s operations and investments 
if future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods  particularly for those with large investments in property and equipment for example  manufacturing  gaming entertainment  land based oil and gas drilling operations  real estate and certain associated company investments  impairment charges would have to be recorded 
impairment of securities declines in the fair values of equity securities considered to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the various factors that the company considers in making its determination are specific to each investment 
for publicly traded debt and equity securities  the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity  and other factors specific to the individual investment 
for investments in private equity funds and non public securities  the company bases its determination upon financial statements  net asset values and or other information obtained from fund managers or investee companies 
the company has a portfolio of non agency mortgage backed bond securitizations  which were acquired at significant discounts to face amounts and are accounted for as acquisitions of impaired loans 
the company estimates the future cash flows for these securities to determine the accretable yield  increases in estimated cash flows are accounted for as a yield adjustment on a prospective basis but decreases in estimated cash flows below amortized cost due to credit losses are recognized as impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
contractual cash flows in excess of estimated cash flows are not part of the accretable yield 
the market for these securities is highly illiquid and they rarely trade 
on a regular basis  the company re estimates the future cash flows of these securities and records impairment charges if appropriate 
the fair values for these securities are primarily determined using an income valuation model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows  which incorporates assumptions regarding potential future rates of delinquency  prepayments  defaults  collateral losses and interest rates 
the company recorded the following impairment charges for securities in the consolidated statement of operations for the three years in the period ended december  in thousands publicly traded securities non public securities and private equity funds non agency mortgage backed bond securitizations totals impairment of equity method investments the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary 
for investments in investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method  the company obtains from the investment partnership financial statements  net asset values and other information on a quarterly basis and annual audited financial statements 
on a quarterly basis  the company also makes inquiries and discusses with investment managers whether there were significant procedural  valuation  composition and other changes at the investee 
since these investment partnerships record their underlying investments at fair value  after application of the equity method the carrying value of the company s investment is equal to its share of the investees underlying net assets at their fair values 
absent any unusual circumstances or restrictions concerning these investments  which would be separately evaluated  it is unlikely that any additional impairment charge would be required 
for equity method investments in operating businesses  the company considers a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation  adverse changes in the industry in which they operate  declines in business prospects  deterioration in earnings  increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee 
whenever the company believes conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be materially impaired  the company will obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets 
the company will use this information and  together with discussions with the investee s management  evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value  and if so and the situation is deemed other than temporary  record an impairment charge 
during the second quarter of  the company s equity in losses of garcadia included impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating  garcadia s automobile dealerships have been adversely impacted by general economic conditions  and the bankruptcy filings by two of the three largest us automobile manufacturers was a change in circumstances that caused garcadia to evaluate the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
garcadia prepared discounted cash flow projections for each of its dealerships and concluded that the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired 
garcadia s cash flow projections assume that new car sales at their foreign car dealerships remain flat with sale levels through and project growth thereafter 
cash flow projections at dealerships that sell domestic cars are projected to continue to decline through or with projected growth thereafter 
none of garcadia s automobile dealerships are currently expected to close as a result of the restructuring of the us automobile manufacturers 
however  if new vehicle sales at garcadia s automobile dealerships are less than projected amounts or dealerships are closed  further impairment charges are likely 
during  the company s equity in losses of ifis includes impairment charges of  ifis is a private argentine company that owns a variety of investments  and its largest investment is ownership of common shares of cresud sociedad anonima comercial  inmobiliaria  financiera y agropecuaria cresud  an agricultural company primarily based in argentina 
as a result of significant declines in quoted market prices for cresud and other investments of ifis  combined with declines in worldwide food commodity prices  the global mortgage and real estate crisis and political and financial conditions in argentina  the company determined that its investment in ifis was impaired 
the fair value of the company s investment in ifis was principally determined using quoted market prices of ifis s investments 
in january  ifis raised a significant amount of new equity in a rights offering in which the company did not participate 
as a result  the company s ownership interest in ifis was reduced to and the company no longer applies the equity method of accounting for this investment 
at december   the company s investment in ifis was classified as a non current investment 
business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these values  and may include the use of appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the company believes to be relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill  which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
at december   the book value of goodwill was  if the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired are greater than the purchase price  the excess is treated as a bargain purchase and recognized in income 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
during  the company acquired a limited liability company interest in keen for aggregate consideration of  excluding expenses  and agreed to lend to keen  on a senior secured basis  up to  to finance new rig equipment purchases and construction costs and to repay existing debt 
during  the company increased its equity interest to for additional payments aggregating  in addition  the credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to  and the company provided keen with two additional secured credit facilities aggregating  when the company increased its investment in keen to  the terms of the limited liability agreement were amended to provide that in the event of a dissolution  liquidation or termination of keen  available cash or assets would first be used to pay all of keen s debts including loans made by the company  then distributed to the company as a liquidation preference until it had received a return of its equity investment  before any payments were made to the other equity owner of keen 
during  the company believes it became apparent to the other equity owner of keen that keen would not be able to make scheduled debt payments to the company  and that the resulting payment default could result in a liquidation of keen 
in that event  the company s liquidation preference over equity distributions would result in very little  if any  distributions to the other equity owner of keen 
in november  the company purchased the other equity interest that it did not own plus a secured note payable to the other equity owner of keen for aggregate cash consideration of  the company believes it was able to acquire the remaining equity interest at this distressed price because of the expected payment default on keen s senior secured debt owed to the company and the company s  preferred equity distribution in the event keen was liquidated 
when the company acquired the controlling interest in keen in november it became a consolidated subsidiary  prior to that time the investment in keen was classified as an investment in an associated company 
under gaap  upon consolidation the company was required to record keen s assets and liabilities at fair value  and was required to adjust the carrying value of the company s equity investment immediately prior to the acquisition to fair value 
due to the unique circumstances surrounding the company s acquisition described above  the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the amount paid by  the bargain purchase was recognized as a gain on the date of acquisition and included in investment and other income 
however  the fair value of the company s equity interest immediately prior to the acquisition was less than its carrying value  accordingly the company included a charge of  in income losses related to associated companies to write down the pre acquisition carrying value of its investment in keen to fair value 
as of the date of acquisition  keen s assets principally consisted of cash and other current assets and property and equipment 
the company engaged an independent valuation and appraisal firm to assist in its determination of the fair value of keen s property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  if any  and corresponding equity value  the fair values of cash and working capital were  property and equipment were  and keen s other assets and liabilities were not material 
the methods used to determine the fair values included estimating keen s business enterprise value  utilizing both discounted cash flow and market comparable based approaches 
property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and current market prices 
the company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment  including local market conditions  recent market transactions  the size  age  condition  utility and character of the property  the estimated cost to acquire replacement property  an estimate of depreciation from use and functional obsolescence and the remaining expected useful life of the assets 
excluding intercompany loans  keen s liabilities principally consisted of trade payables which were recorded at face value 
the most significant estimate made in recording the acquisition of keen was the amount recorded for property and equipment  principally drilling rigs and related equipment 
during  keen s revenue volume and profitability were adversely affected by the expiration of term contracts during a time of low gas prices  high levels of natural gas in storage and generally adverse economic conditions that have reduced the drilling activity of keen s customers 
if these trends continue and keen s revenues remain depressed  it is possible that the fair values of keen s property and equipment may decline  resulting in the recording of impairment charges in the future 
use of fair value estimates under gaap  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
further  a fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  the next priority to inputs that don t qualify as level inputs but are nonetheless observable  either directly or indirectly  for the particular asset or liability level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
over of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities  which are carried at estimated fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices level inputs  which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events  and as such are subject to market related risks and uncertainties 
the company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass through certificates issued by us government sponsored enterprises fhlmc or fnma  which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  at december  although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active  market prices are not always available for the identical security 
the fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids and offers 
these estimates of fair value are considered to be level inputs  and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been materially different from their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the company s portfolio of non agency mortgage backed bond securitizations  which are primarily determined using an income valuation model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows  are considered to be level inputs 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain  in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the company to control 
the company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  however  if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts  the excess could be material to results of operations for that period 
as of december   the company s accrual for contingent losses was not material 
results of operations substantially all of the company s operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the us and to a lesser extent internationally 
poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the company s operating subsidiaries and or resulted in reduced pricing for products or services 
troubled industry sectors  like the residential real estate market  have had an adverse direct impact not only on the company s real estate and property management and services segments  but have also had an adverse indirect impact on some of the company s other operating segments  including manufacturing and gaming entertainment 
the discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impact such conditions have had and may continue to have on each segment  however  should general economic conditions worsen and or if the country experiences a prolonged recession  the company believes that all of its businesses would be adversely impacted

keen s revenue volume and profitability are significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and levels of natural gas in storage 
the natural gas exploration and production industry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile 
during periods of lower levels of drilling activity  price competition for drilling services tends to increase which may result in reduced revenues and profitability  conversely  during periods of increased drilling activity drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term 
during  low natural gas prices  rising levels of natural gas storage and tight credit markets forced many of keen s customers to make significant reductions in their drilling programs  which adversely impacted keen s revenues and profitability 
although there has been recent improvement in natural gas prices  keen s profitability will not significantly improve without increased natural gas demand to sustain the rise in natural gas prices 
increased industrial demand for natural gas  which is tied to achieving economic recovery  is required to significantly improve demand 
in the short term  a colder than average winter can also impact demand for natural gas
