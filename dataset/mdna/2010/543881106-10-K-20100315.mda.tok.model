overview businesses loral has two segments  satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
loral participates in satellite services operations principally through its investment in telesat 
satellite manufacturing space systems loral  inc ss l designs and manufactures satellites  space systems and space system components for commercial and government customers whose applications include fixed satellite services fss  direct to home dth broadcasting  mobile satellite services mss  broadband data distribution  wireless telephony  digital radio  digital mobile broadcasting  military communications  weather monitoring and air traffic management 
satellite manufacturers have high fixed costs relating primarily to labor and overhead 
based on its current cost structure  we estimate that ss l covers its fixed costs  including depreciation and amortization  with an average of four to five satellite awards a year depending on the size  power  pricing and complexity of the satellite 
cash flow in the satellite manufacturing business tends to be uneven 
it takes two to three years to complete a satellite project and numerous assumptions are built into the estimated costs 
ss l s cash receipts are tied to the achievement of contract milestones that depend in part on the ability of its subcontractors to deliver on time 
in addition  the timing of satellite awards is difficult to predict  contributing to the unevenness of revenue and making it more challenging to align the workforce to the workflow 

table of contents while its requirement for ongoing capital investment to maintain its current capacity is relatively low  over the past several years ss l has modified and expanded its manufacturing facilities to accommodate an expanded backlog 
ss l can now accommodate as many as nine to satellite awards per year  depending on the complexity and timing of the specific satellites  and can accommodate the integration and test of to satellites at any given time in its palo alto facility 
the expansion has also reduced the company s reliance on outside suppliers for certain rf components and sub assemblies 
the satellite manufacturing industry is a knowledge intensive business  the success of which relies heavily on its technological heritage and the skills of its workforce 
the breadth and depth of talent and experience resident in ss l s workforce of approximately  personnel is one of our key competitive resources 
satellites are extraordinarily complex devices designed to operate in the very hostile environment of space 
this complexity may lead to unanticipated costs during the design  manufacture and testing of a satellite 
ss l establishes provisions for costs based on historical experience and program complexity to cover anticipated costs 
as most of ss l s contracts are fixed price  cost increases in excess of these provisions reduce profitability and may result in losses to ss l  which may be material 
because the satellite manufacturing industry is highly competitive  buyers have the advantage over suppliers in negotiating prices  terms and conditions resulting in reduced margins and increased assumptions of risk by manufacturers such as ss l 
satellite services the satellite services business is capital intensive and the build out of a satellite fleet requires substantial time and investment 
once these investments are made  however  the costs to maintain and operate the fleet are relatively low with the exception of in orbit insurance 
upfront investments are earned back through the leasing of transponders to customers over the life of the satellite 
after approximately years of operation  telesat has established collaborative relationships with its customers so revenue from the satellite services business is fairly predictable with long term contracts and high contract renewal rates 
competition in the satellite services market has been intense in recent years due to a number of factors  including transponder over capacity in certain geographic regions and increased competition from terrestrial based communications networks 
at december   telesat had in orbit satellites 
these satellites had an average of approximately of service life remaining  with an average service life remaining of approximately years 
telesat currently has two satellites under construction  both by ss l telstar r estrela do sul  which telesat anticipates will be launched in mid  and nimiq for which telesat recently started construction and anticipates a launch date in mid until the closing of the telesat transaction on october   loral skynet operated a global fixed satellite services business 
as part of this business  loral skynet leased transponder capacity to commercial and government customers for video distribution and broadcasting  high speed data distribution  internet access and communications  and also provided managed network services to customers using a hybrid satellite and ground based system 
it also provided professional services to other satellite operators such as fleet operating services 
future outlook satellite manufacturing critical success factors for ss l include maintaining its reputation for reliability  quality and superior customer service 
these factors are vital to securing new customers and retaining current ones 
at the same time  we must continue to contain costs and maximize efficiencies 
ss l is focused on increasing bookings and backlog  while maintaining the cost efficiencies and process improvements realized over the past several years 
ss l must continue to align its direct labor workforce with the level of awards 
additionally  long term growth at ss l generates working capital requirements  primarily for the orbital component of the satellite contract which is payable to ss l over the life of the satellite 

table of contents ss l booked seven satellite awards for in addition to the seven satellites booked in while we expect the replacement market to be reliable over the next year  given the current condition of the credit markets  potential customers that are highly leveraged or in the development stage may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to purchase satellites 
if ss l s satellite awards fall below  on average  four to five awards per year  we expect that we will reduce costs to accommodate this lower level of business 
the timing of any reduced demand for satellites is difficult to predict 
it is therefore also difficult to anticipate when to reduce costs to match any slowdown in business  especially when ss l has significant backlog business to perform 
a delay in matching the timing of a reduction in business with a reduction in expenditures would adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  in order to maintain its ability to compete as one of the leading prime contractors for technologically advanced space satellites  ss l must continuously retain the services of a core group of specialists in a wide variety of disciplines for each phase of the design  development  manufacture and testing of its products  thus reducing ss l s flexibility to take action to reduce workforce costs in the event of a slowdown or downturn in its business 
satellite services loral holds a economic interest and a voting interest in telesat  the world s fourth largest satellite operator with approximately billion of backlog as of december  telesat is committed to continuing to provide the strong customer service and focus on innovation and technical expertise that has allowed it to successfully build its business to date 
building on backlog and significant contracted growth  telesat s focus is on taking disciplined steps to grow the core business and sell newly launched and existing in orbit satellite capacity  and  in a disciplined manner  use the cash flow generated by existing business  contracted expansion satellites and cost savings to strengthen the business 
telesat believes its existing satellite fleet supports a strong combination of existing backlog and revenue growth 
the growth is expected to come from the nimiq satellite  which entered commercial service in october  telstar r  to be launched in mid  and the nimiq satellite  which is expected to be launched in mid  as well as the utilization of additional capacity on the existing satellites 
telesat believes this fleet of satellites provides a solid foundation upon which it will seek to grow its revenues and cash flows 
telesat believes that it is well positioned to serve its customers and the markets in which it participates 
telesat actively pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  particularly in conjunction with current or prospective customers  who will commit to a substantial amount of capacity at the time the satellite construction contract is signed 
although telesat regularly pursues opportunities to develop new satellites  it does not procure additional or replacement satellites unless it believes there is a demonstrated need and a sound business plan for such capacity 
the satellite industry is characterized by a relatively fixed cost base that allows significant revenue growth with relatively minimal increases in operating costs  particularly for sales of satellite capacity 
thus  telesat anticipates that it can increase its revenue without proportional increases in operating expenses  allowing for margin expansion 
the fixed cost nature of the business  combined with contracted revenue growth and other growth opportunities  is expected to produce growth in operating income and cash flow 
for  telesat continues to focus on the execution of its business plan to serve its customers and the market in which it participates  the sale of capacity on its existing satellites and the continuing efforts to achieve operating efficiencies 
telesat will also continue to pursue the expansion of its fleet with the on going construction of nimiq as well as the replacement of telstar telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
approximately of telesat s revenues received in canada for the year ended december   certain of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
however during that same time period  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
in connection with the introduction of its budget for  the government of canada is proposing to remove the existing restrictions on foreign ownership of canadian satellites 
telesat has indicated its support for the government s decision and believes that removing such restrictions could result in telesat being a more effective global competitor and being able to invest in new and advanced technologies for the benefit of all canadians 
legislation to implement the government s proposal has not yet been introduced  and  if introduced  there is no assurance as to exactly what changes will be proposed  whether in fact such legislation will be adopted and  if adopted  how current regulations governing the foreign ownership and control of satellites may be changed 

table of contents general we regularly explore and evaluate possible strategic transactions and alliances 
we also periodically engage in discussions with satellite service providers  satellite manufacturers and others regarding such matters  which may include joint ventures and strategic relationships as well as business combinations or the acquisition or disposition of assets 
in order to pursue certain of these opportunities  we will require additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will enter into additional strategic transactions or alliances  nor do we know if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for these transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
we are investing in the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite which is being constructed by ss l 
on december   we entered into an agreement to lease a portion of the canadian coverage portion of the satellite and provide gateway services to an internet broadband service provider for between cad million and cad million over the year life of the satellite 
loral expects to have invested approximately million  excluding customer prepayments of between cad million and cad million  by the time service is initiated 
approximately million has been invested through december   with the remaining million to be invested in and in connection with the telesat transaction  loral has agreed that  subject to certain exceptions described in telesat s shareholders agreement  for so long as loral has an interest in telesat  it will not compete in the business of leasing  selling or otherwise furnishing fixed satellite service  broadcast satellite service or audio and video broadcast direct to home service using transponder capacity in the c band  ku band and ka band including in each case extended band frequencies and the business of providing end to end data solutions on networks comprised of earth terminals  space segment  and  where appropriate  networking hubs 
consolidated operating results please refer to critical accounting matters set forth below in this section 
the following discussion of revenues and adjusted ebitda see note to the financial statements reflects the results of our business segments for  and the balance of the discussion relates to our consolidated results unless otherwise noted 
the common definition of ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in evaluating financial performance  we use revenues and operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation including stock based compensation from ss l phantom stock appreciation rights expected to be settled in loral common stock adjusted ebitda as the measure of a segment s profit or loss 
adjusted ebitda is equivalent to the common definition of ebitda before goodwill and other impairment charges  gain loss on foreign exchange contracts  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  impairment of available for sale securities  loss on extinguishment of debt  other income expense  and equity in net income losses of affiliates 
adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare our operating results with that of competitors exclusive of depreciation and amortization  interest and investment income  interest expense  goodwill and other impairment charges  gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts  gains or losses on litigation not related to our operations  impairments of available for sale securities  other income expense and equity in net income losses of affiliates 
financial results of competitors in our industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures  the amount of intangible assets recorded  the differences in assets lives  the timing and amount of investments  the effects of other income expense  which are typically for non recurring transactions not related to the on going business  and effects of investments not directly managed 
the use of adjusted ebitda allows us and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items 
competitors in our industry have significantly different capital structures 
the use of adjusted ebitda maintains comparability of performance by excluding interest expense 
we believe the use of adjusted ebitda along with us gaap financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and is useful to us and investors in comparing performance with competitors  estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions 
adjusted ebitda as used here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by competitors 
we also use adjusted ebitda to evaluate operating performance of our segments  to allocate resources and capital to such segments  to measure performance for incentive compensation programs and to evaluate future growth opportunities 
adjusted ebitda should be used in conjunction with us gaap financial measures and is not presented as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 

table of contents loral has two segments satellite manufacturing and satellite services 
our segment reporting data includes unconsolidated affiliates that meet the reportable segment criteria 
the satellite services segment includes of the results reported by telesat for the years ended december  and and for the period from october  to december  although we analyze telesat s revenue and expenses under the satellite services segment  we eliminate its results in our consolidated financial statements  where we report our share of telesat s results under the equity method of accounting

impairment of long lived and intangible assets consists primarily of an impairment charge in to reduce certain orbital slot assets to fair value 
other expense  net includes non cash foreign exchange gains of million and non cash losses on financial instruments of million in and non cash foreign exchange losses of million and million and non cash gains on financial instruments of million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
telesat s main currency exposures as of december   lie in its us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt financing 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
we estimated that  after considering the impact of hedges  a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
however during that same time period  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
the equity losses in xtar  llc xtar  our owned joint venture  represent our share of xtar losses incurred in connection with its operations 
other equity losses in affiliates for include million of cash distributions received from globalstar de mexico for which our investment balance has been written down to zero and a loss of million recognized in connection with an agreement to sell our globalstar investment partnership in brazil 
this sale was completed in the first quarter of backlog backlog as of december  and was as follows in millions satellite manufacturing satellite services total backlog before eliminations satellite manufacturing eliminations satellite services eliminations total backlog it is expected that approximately of satellite manufacturing backlog as of december  will be recognized as revenue during telesat backlog at december  was approximately billion  of which approximately will be recognized as revenue during as of december   telesat had received approximately million of customer prepayments  none of which is related to satellites under construction 
critical accounting matters the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the period 
actual results could differ from estimates 
revenue recognition most of our satellite manufacturing revenue is associated with long term fixed price contracts 
revenue and profit from satellite sales under these long term contracts are recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method  which requires significant estimates 
we use this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include forecasts of costs and schedules  estimating contract revenue related to contract performance including estimated amounts for penalties  performance incentives and orbital incentives that will be received as the satellite performs on orbit and the potential for component obsolescence in connection with long term procurements 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when estimates determine that a loss will be incurred on a contract at completion 
under firm fixed price contracts  work performed and products shipped are paid for at a fixed price without adjustment for actual costs incurred in connection with the contract  accordingly  favorable changes in estimates in a period will result in additional revenue and profit  and unfavorable changes in estimates will result in a reduction of revenue and profit or the recording of a loss that will be borne solely by us 

table of contents billed receivables and long term receivables we are required to estimate the collectibility of our billed receivables which are included in contracts in process on our consolidated balance sheet and our long term receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
charges for recoveries of bad debts recorded to the statements of operations on billed receivables for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   and  billed receivables were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  million and million  respectively 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are re evaluated periodically 
inventories inventories are reviewed for estimated obsolescence or unusable items and  if appropriate  are written down to the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the inventory 
charges for inventory obsolescence included in the consolidated statements of operations were million for the year ended december  and were insignificant for the years ending december  and fair value measurements us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants 
us gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to observable inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets at the measurement date 
level inputs represent a fair value that is derived from quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and pricing inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair values are therefore determined using model based techniques that include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models  and similar techniques 
these provisions are applicable to all of the company s assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december  level level level in thousands assets marketable securities derivatives  net non qualified pension plan assets the company does not have any non financial assets or non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  
table of contents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis we review the carrying values of our equity method investments when events and circumstances warrant and consider all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are other than temporary 
the fair values of our investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available  and may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
an impairment charge would be recorded when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its current fair value and is determined to be other than temporary 
we had no equity method investments measured at fair value at december  taxation loral is subject to us federal  state and local income taxation on its worldwide income and foreign taxes on certain income from sources outside the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to taxation in local jurisdictions 
telesat is subject to tax in canada and other jurisdictions and loral will provide in operating earnings any additional us current or deferred tax required on distributions received or deemed distributions from telesat 
we use the liability method in accounting for taxes whereby income taxes are recognized during the year in which transactions are recorded in the financial statements 
deferred taxes reflect the future tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying anticipated statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  based upon this analysis  record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria 
based upon this analysis  we concluded upon emergence from bankruptcy in that  due to insufficient positive evidence substantiating recoverability  we were required to maintain the valuation allowance previously established against our net deferred tax assets 
for  we continued to maintain the valuation allowance decreasing the balance from december  of million by million to million 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million  which when offset by our deferred tax liabilities of million and our valuation allowance of million  resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million on our consolidated balance sheet 
for periods prior to january  any reduction to the balance of the valuation allowance as of october  first reduced goodwill  then other intangible assets with any excess treated as an increase to paid in capital 
effective january   all reversals of the valuation allowance balance as of october  are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision 
we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its full or partial reversal 
the tax effects of an uncertain tax position utp taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize estimated accrued interest and penalties related to utps in income tax expense 
we recognize the benefit of a utp in the period when it is effectively settled 
previously recognized tax positions are derecognized in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
evaluating the technical merits of a tax position and determining the benefit to be recognized involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying such evaluation 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and if settled favorably  subsequent recognition will reduce our effective tax rate 
pension and other employee benefits we maintain a pension plan and a supplemental retirement plan 
these plans are defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to providing pension benefits  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees and dependents 
these pension and other employee benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  as well as our actual experience 

table of contents the discount rate is subject to change each year  based on a hypothetical yield curve developed from a portfolio of high quality  corporate  non callable bonds with maturities that match our projected benefit payment stream 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of the plan liability cash flows to the yield curve 
changes in applicable high quality long term corporate bond indices  such as the moody s aa corporate bond index  are also considered 
the discount rate determined on this basis was as of december   a decrease of basis points from december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the plan s projected benefit obligation  asset mix and the fact that its assets are actively managed to mitigate risk 
allowable investment types include equity investments and fixed income investments 
pension plan assets are managed by russell investment corp 
russell  which allocates the assets into specified russell designed funds as we direct 
each specified russell fund is then managed by investment managers chosen by russell 
we also engage non russell related investment mangers through russell  in its role as trustee  to invest pension plan assets 
the targeted long term allocation of our pension plan assets is in equity investments and in fixed income investments 
based on this target allocation  the twenty five year historical return of our asset mix has been 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets determined on this basis was for  for and for for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 
these pension and other employee postretirement benefit costs are expected to decrease to approximately million in from million in  primarily due to the increase in the expected return on plan assets and decreased amortization of actuarial losses 
lowering the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return each by would have increased these pension and other employee postretirement benefits costs by approximately million and million  respectively  in the benefit obligations for pensions and other employee benefits exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  we are required to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan on our balance sheet 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect future assets and liabilities of loral s pension and other employee benefits plans 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
in addition  share based payment transactions with nonemployees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument issued 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model and other models as applicable to estimate the fair value of these stock based awards 
these models require us to make significant judgments regarding the assumptions used within the models  the most significant of which are the stock price volatility assumption  the expected life of the option award  the risk free rate of return and dividends during the expected term 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of stock based compensation we recognize 
the company estimates expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed in each reporting period and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we emerged from bankruptcy on november   and as a result  we did not have sufficient stock price history upon which to base our volatility assumption for measuring our stock based awards 
in determining the volatility used in our models  we considered the volatility of the stock prices of selected companies in the satellite industry  the nature of those companies  our emergence from bankruptcy and other factors in determining our stock price volatility 
we based our estimate of the average life of a stock based award using the midpoint between the vesting and expiration dates 
our risk free rate of return assumption for awards was based on term matching  nominal  monthly us treasury constant maturity rates as of the date of grant 
we assumed no dividends during the expected term 
ss l phantom stock appreciation rights that are expected to be settled in cash or that contain an obligation to issue a variable number of shares based on the financial performance of ss l are classified as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represented the amount by which the company s reorganization equity value exceeded the fair value of its tangible assets and identified intangible assets less its liabilities  as of october   the date we adopted fresh start accounting 
our goodwill impairment test resulted in the recording of an impairment charge in for the entire goodwill balance of million 
the company s estimate of the fair value of ss l employed both a comparable public company analysis  which considered the valuation multiples of companies deemed comparable  in whole or in part  to the company and a discounted cash flow analysis that calculated a present value of the projected future cash flows of ss l 
the company considered both quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions used in the valuation process 
testing goodwill for impairment requires significant subjective judgments by management 

table of contents contingencies contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss  if any 
we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when  in management s opinion  such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
accounting standards issued and not yet implemented for discussion of accounting standards issued and not yet implemented  see note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as described above  the company s principal assets are of the capital stock of ss l and a economic interest in telesat 
in addition  the company has a economic interest in xtar and is also investing in the entire canadian capacity of the viasat satellite which is under construction 
ss l s operations as well as the canadian viasat operations insignificant other than capital expenditures until the satellite is launched are consolidated in the company s financial statements  while the operations of telesat and xtar are not consolidated but presented using the equity method of accounting 
the parent company has no debt  ss l has a million revolving credit facility under which only million of letter of credit capacity is utilized as of december  telesat has third party debt with financial institutions  and xtar has debt to its llc member  hisdesat  loral s joint venture partner in xtar 
the parent company has provided a guarantee of ss l s million credit facility but has not provided a guarantee for the telesat or xtar debt 
cash is maintained at the parent company  ss l  telesat and xtar to support the operating needs of each respective entity 
the ability of ss l and telesat to pay dividends and management fees in cash to the parent company is governed by applicable covenants relating to the debt at each of those entities and in the case of telesat and xtar by their respective shareholder agreements 
cash and available credit at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash and no debt outstanding 
this represents an improvement of million from our cash position  net of borrowings  at december  our improved cash position is primarily the result of improved operating results  increased customer advances  reduced inventory levels and tax refunds 
during the first three months of  ss l repaid the million of loans that were outstanding at december   and has not borrowed any new funds under its million revolving credit agreement 
at december   ss l had million of letters of credit outstanding 
the restricted cash balance at december  is substantially unchanged from december  the ss l credit agreement  which is guaranteed pursuant to a parent guarantee agreement  provides ss l with a million revolving credit facility  including a million letter of credit sub limit 
any borrowings under the ss l credit agreement mature on october  as of march   ss l has borrowing availability of approximately million under the facility after giving effect to approximately million of outstanding letters of credit 
ss l anticipates that over the next months it will be in compliance with all the covenants of the ss l credit agreement and have full availability of the facility 

table of contents cash management we have a cash management investment program that seeks a competitive return while maintaining a conservative risk profile 
our cash management investment policy establishes what we believe to be conservative guidelines relating to the investment of surplus cash 
the policy allows us to invest in commercial paper  money market funds and other similar short term investments but does not permit us to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit us to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the cash management investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all of our liquidity requirements and to provide a competitive rate of return 
the policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities on our behalf  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
we operate the cash management investment program under the guidelines of our investment policy and continuously monitor the investments to avoid risks 
we currently invest our cash in several liquid prime aaa money market funds 
the dispersion across funds reduces the exposure of a default at one fund 
during  the company moved its investments from treasury funds and government funds to increase yield given the partial recovery in the credit markets 
we do not currently hold any investments in auction rate securities or enhanced money market funds that had previously been subject to liquidity issues and price declines 
liquidity during  the parent company funded its portion of the construction  launch and insurance costs of the viasat satellite  paid attorneys fees associated with the shareholder derivative litigation  made a cash investment in xtar and funded parent company operating costs 
for and  the parent company will continue to fund its portion of the construction  launch and insurance costs of the viasat satellite as well as fund gateway and related costs to prepare for service so as to fulfill its obligations under the lease agreement for the canadian coverage portion of the viasat satellite entered into on december  total viasat related expenditures for the parent company for and are estimated to be approximately million  some of which will be offset by lessee prepayments of between cad million and cad million in the company is obligated to indemnify its directors and officers for expenses incurred by them in connection with their defense in the delaware shareholder derivative case relating to the company s sale in of million of preferred stock to certain funds affiliated with mhr 
the company has directors and officers liability insurance coverage that provides the company with coverage of up to million for amounts paid as a result of these indemnification obligations 
as of december   the insurers have advanced approximately million in defense costs  and the company is seeking to recover from its insurers million in fees and expenses previously paid to plaintiffs counsel in the litigation and million in defense costs and expenses that have been denied by the insurers 
in addition  the company is seeking to recover from its insurers any defense costs and expenses that may be determined by a special committee of the board to be properly payable to its directors who are affiliated with mhr who have requested indemnification for defense costs and expenses in the amount  as of november   of approximately million see note to the financial statements for a detailed discussion of these matters 
to the extent the company s indemnification obligations exceed the million limit of its insurance coverage  the company will have to pay this excess from its own cash on hand 
moreover  to the extent that the company does not prevail in its litigation with its insurers  the company will be obligated to pay all indemnification obligations not already paid from its own cash on hand 
at the parent company  we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund projected expenditures for the next months 
in addition  we believe that ss l  telesat and xtar have sufficient liquidity to fund their respective requirements for the next months and  as such  will not require funding from the parent company 
in addition to our cash on hand  we believe that given the substantial value of our unleveraged assets  which consist of our economic interest in telesat  our equity interest in xtar and the viasat canadian broadband lease  we have the ability  if appropriate  to access the financial markets for debt or equity at the parent company 
given the uncertain financial environment  however  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms 
during  ss l generated significant positive cash flow while also funding the continued increase in its orbital receivable asset  capital expenditures and repaying its outstanding debt 
for each of and  ss l s capital expenditures are projected to be to million 
this is above our normal level of annual capital expenditures of between million and million 
for and  we anticipate completing certain building modifications and purchasing additional test and satellite handling equipment required to meet our contractual obligations as a result of our increased backlog and size and complexity of the satellites under construction 
as demonstrated by ss l s actual capital expenditures falling below previously projected amounts in and  ss l maintains the flexibility to defer a portion of its ongoing capital expenditures as circumstances may require 
in addition  in ss l expects to fund the growth in its orbital receivable asset by more than million see discussion below 
finally  with the termination of the sirius credit agreement in december  there is no short term funding requirement associated with the construction of the fm satellite 
ss l believes that  absent unforeseen circumstances  with its cash on hand and cash flow from operations  it has sufficient liquidity to fulfill its obligations for the next months 
the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility enhances the liquidity position of ss l 

table of contents satellite construction contracts often include provisions for orbital incentives pursuant to which a portion of the contract value typically about is received over the life of the satellite typically years 
receipt of these orbital incentives is contingent upon performance of the satellite in accordance with contractual specifications 
as of december   ss l has orbital receivables of approximately million  net of fair value adjustments of million 
approximately million of the gross orbital receivables are related to satellites launched as of december   and million are related to satellites that are under construction as of december  this represents an increase in orbital receivables of approximately million from the december  level 
current economic conditions  though improved from december  could affect the ability of customers to make payments  including orbital incentive payments  under satellite construction contracts with ss l 
though most of ss l s customers are substantial corporations for which creditworthiness is generally high  ss l has certain customers which are either highly leveraged or are in the developmental stage and are not fully funded 
customers that are facing maturities on their existing debt also have elevated credit risk under current market conditions 
there can be no assurance that these customers will not delay contract payments to  or seek financial relief from  ss l 
if customers fall behind or are unable to meet their payment obligations  ss l s liquidity will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that ss l s customers will not default on their obligations to ss l in the future and that such defaults will not materially and adversely affect ss l and loral 
in the event of an uncured payment default by a customer during the pre launch construction phase of the satellite  ss l s construction contracts generally provide ss l with significant rights even if its customers or successors have paid significant amounts under the contract 
these rights typically include the right to stop work on the satellite and the right to terminate the contract for default 
in the latter case  ss l would generally have the right to retain  and sell to other customers  the satellite or satellite components that are under construction 
the exercise of such rights  however  could be impeded by the assertion by customers of defenses and counterclaims  including claims of breach of performance obligations on the part of ss l  and our recovery could be reduced by the lack of a ready resale market for the affected satellites or their components 
in either case  our liquidity could be adversely affected pending resolution of such customer disputes 
in the event of an uncured payment default by a customer after satellite delivery and launch when title has passed to the customer  ss l s remedies are more limited 
typically  amounts due post launch and delivery are final milestone payments and  in certain cases  orbital incentive payments 
to recover such amounts  ss l generally would have to commence litigation to enforce its rights 
we believe  however  that  as customers generally rely on ss l to provide orbital anomaly and troubleshooting support for the life of the satellite  which support is generally perceived to be critical to maximize the life and performance of the satellite  it is likely that customers or their successors will cure any payment defaults and fulfill their payment obligations or make other satisfactory arrangements to obtain ss l s support  and our liquidity would not be adversely affected 
as of december   ss l had renegotiated payment terms of certain past due receivables and future payment obligations from dbsd satellite services gp formerly known as ico satellite services gp and referred to herein as ico  a customer with an ss l built satellite in orbit 
ico  which filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in may  has agreed to  and the bankruptcy court has approved  ico s assumption of its contract with ss l 
ss l will receive substantially the same net present value from ico as ss l was entitled to receive under the original contract 
ico s plan of reorganization was confirmed by the bankruptcy court in october the effective date of the plan is subject to  among other things  regulatory approval of the fcc 
ss l s contracts contain detailed and complex technical specifications to which the satellite must be built 
ss l s contracts also impose a variety of other contractual obligations on ss l  including the requirement to deliver the satellite by an agreed upon date  subject to negotiated allowances 
if ss l is unable to meet its contract obligations  including significant deviations from technical specifications or delivering the satellite beyond the agreed upon date in a contract  the customer would have the right to terminate the contract for contractor default 
if a contract is terminated for contractor default  ss l would be required to refund the payments made to ss l to date  which could be significant 
in such circumstances  ss l would  however  keep the satellite under construction and be able to recoup some of its losses through the resale of the satellite or its components to another customer 
it has been ss l s experience that  because the satellite is generally critical to the execution of a customer s operations and business plan  customers will usually accept a satellite with minor deviations from specifications or renegotiate a revised delivery date with ss l as opposed to terminating the contract for contractor default and losing the satellite 
nonetheless  the obligation to return all funds paid to ss l in the later stages of a contract  due to termination for contractor default  would have a material adverse effect on ss l s liquidity 

table of contents ss l currently has a contract in process with an estimated delivery date later than the contractually specified date after which the customer may terminate the contract for default 
the customer is an established operator which will utilize the satellite in the operation of its existing business 
ss l and the customer are continuing to perform their obligations under the contract  and the customer continues to make milestone payments to ss l 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that the customer will take delivery of this satellite and will not seek to terminate the contract for default 
if the customer should terminate the contract for default  the customer would be entitled to a full refund of its payments and liquidated damages  which through december  totaled approximately million  plus re procurement costs and interest 
in the event of a termination for default  ss l would own the satellite and would attempt to recoup any losses through resale to another customer 
as of december   ss l had booked seven satellite awards for the year in addition to the seven satellites booked last year  resulting in backlog of billion 
if ss l s satellite awards fall below  on average  four to five awards per year  ss l would be required to phase in a reduction of costs to accommodate this lower level of activity 
the timing of any reduced demand for satellites  if it were to occur  is difficult to predict 
it is  therefore  difficult to anticipate the need to reduce costs to match any such slowdown in business  especially when ss l has significant backlog business to perform 
a delay in matching the timing of a reduction in business with a reduction in expenditures could adversely affect our liquidity 
we believe that ss l s current backlog  existing liquidity and availability under the ss l credit agreement are sufficient to finance ss l  even if we receive fewer than four to five awards over the next months 
if ss l were to experience a shortage of orders below the four to five awards per year for multiple years  ss l could require additional financing  the amount and timing of which would depend on the magnitude of the order shortfall coupled with the timing of a reduction in costs 
there can be no assurance that the ss l could obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
telesat cash and available credit as of december   telesat had cad million of cash and short term investments as well as approximately cad million of borrowing availability under its revolving facility 
telesat believes that cash and short term investments as of december   cash flow from operations  including amounts provided by operating activities  cash flow from customer prepayments and drawings on the available lines of credit under the credit facility as defined below will be adequate to meet its expected cash requirement for the next months for activities in the normal course of business  including interest and required principal payments on debt as well as planned capital expenditures 
telesat has adopted what it believes are conservative policies relating to and governing the investment of its surplus cash 
the investment policy does not permit telesat to engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it permit telesat to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the investment policy was designed to preserve capital and safeguard principal  to meet all liquidity requirements of telesat and to provide a competitive rate of return 
the investment policy addresses dealer qualifications  lists approved securities  establishes minimum acceptable credit ratings  sets concentration limits  defines a maturity structure  requires all firms to safe keep securities  requires certain mandatory reporting activity and discusses review of the portfolio 
telesat operates its investment program under the guidelines of its investment policy 
liquidity a large portion of telesat s annual cash receipts are reasonably predictable because they are primarily derived from an existing backlog of long term customer contracts and high contract renewal rates 
telesat believes its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to provide for its capital requirements and to fund its interest and debt payment obligations for the next months 
cash required for the construction of the telstar r and nimiq satellites will be funded from some or all of the following cash and short term investments  cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  cash flow from customer prepayments or through borrowings on available lines of credit under the credit facility 
telesat maintains a target of approximately cad million in cash and cash equivalents within its subsidiary operating entities for the management of its liquidity 
telesat s intention is to maintain at least this level of cash and cash equivalents to assist with the day to day management of its cash flows 

table of contents debt telesat has entered into agreements with a syndicate of banks to provide telesat with a series of term loan facilities denominated in canadian dollars and us dollars  and a revolving facility collectively  the senior secured credit facilities as outlined below 
in addition  telesat has issued two tranches of notes 
december  december  maturity currency in cad millions senior secured credit facilities revolving facility october  cad or usd equivalent canadian term loan facility october  cad us term loan facility october  usd   us term loan ii facility october  usd senior notes november  usd senior subordinated notes november  usd cad   current portion cad long term portion cad   the outstanding debt balances above  with the exception of the revolving credit facility and the canadian term loan  are presented net of related debt issuance costs 
the debt issuance costs in the amount of cad million related to the revolving credit facility and the canadian term loan are included in other assets and are amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis 
all other debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method 
the senior secured credit facilities are secured by substantially all of telesat s assets 
each tranche of the senior secured credit facilities is subject to mandatory principal repayment requirements 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a base interest rate plus margins of basis points

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency loral we  in the normal course of business  are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to limit this foreign exchange rate exposure  the company seeks to denominate its contracts in us dollars 
if we are unable to enter into a contract in us dollars  we review our foreign exchange exposure and  where appropriate derivatives are used to minimize the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to operating results and cash flows 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   ss l had the following amounts denominated in japanese yen and euros which have been translated into us dollars based on the december  exchange rates that were unhedged foreign currency us in millions future revenues japanese yen future expenditures japanese yen contracts in process  unbilled receivables japanese yen future revenues euros future expenditures euros derivatives on july   ss l was awarded a satellite contract denominated in euros and entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities through to hedge the associated foreign currency exchange risk 
these foreign exchange forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of future euro denominated receivables 
the maturity of foreign currency exchange contracts held as of december  is consistent with the contractual or expected timing of the transactions being hedged  principally receipt of customer payments under long term contracts 
these foreign exchange contracts mature as follows to sell at at euro contract market amount rate rate maturity in millions 
table of contents as a result of the use of derivative instruments  the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counterparty credit risk  the company has a policy of entering into contracts only with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments was a net asset position of million as of december  this amount represents the maximum exposure to loss at december  as a result of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted 
telesat telesat s operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate variations to the extent that transactions are made in currencies other than canadian dollars 
approximately of telesat s revenues for the year ended december   certain of its expenses and a substantial portion of its indebtedness and capital expenditures were denominated in us dollars 
the most significant impact of variations in the exchange rate is on the us dollar denominated debt financing 
a five percent change in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar at december  would have increased or decreased telesat s net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
during the period from october  to december   telesat s us term loan facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes have increased by approximately million due to the stronger us dollar 
however during that same time period  the liability created by the fair value of the currency basis swap  which synthetically converts billion of the us term loan facility debt into cad billion of debt  decreased by approximately million 
interest the company had no borrowings outstanding under the ss l credit agreement at december  borrowings under this facility are limited to eurodollar loans for periods ending in one  two  three or six months or abr loans which rate is adjusted daily based upon changes in the prime rate or federal funds rate 
because of the nature of the borrowing under a revolving credit facility  the borrowing rate adjusts to changes in interest rates over time 
for a million credit facility  if it were fully borrowed  a one percent change in interest rates would effect the company s interest expense by million for the year 
the company had no other long term debt or other exposure to changes in interest rates with respect thereto 
as of december   the company held  shares of globalstar inc common stock and million of non qualified pension plan assets that were mainly invested in equity and bond funds 
during the year  our excess cash was invested in money market securities  we did not hold any other marketable securities
