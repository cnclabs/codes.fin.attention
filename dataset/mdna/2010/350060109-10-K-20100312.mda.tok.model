developments in  we discovered that some of the prestressed concrete railroad ties manufactured between and by our cxt rail operation in grand island  ne had failed in track 
we believe the cause was related to equipment fatigue on one production line at our grand island  ne facility before it was retrofitted with new equipment in the fall of we recorded a charge of million within cost of goods sold for our estimate of cracked concrete ties related to this issue 
while we believe this is a reasonable estimate of this potential warranty claim  this estimate could change due to new information and future events 
there can be no assurance at this point that future costs pertaining to this issue will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
also during the second quarter of  the uprr notified us that they would not accept certain prestressed concrete railroad ties produced at our grand island  ne facility due to questionable quality of certain raw materials 
we believe this issue is isolated to below specification raw material used in the production process received from one supplier 
we brought these concrete ties back into inventory and wrote them down to our expected net realizable value 
the impact of these rejected prestressed concrete railroad ties was a net unfavorable charge to gross profit of approximately million

the joint venture will manufacture  market and sell various products  including couplings and micropile  for the energy  utility and construction markets 
the joint venture commenced operations during critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb statement no 
this statement modifies the generally accepted accounting principles gaap hierarchy by establishing only two levels of gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative accounting literature 
effective july  the fasb accounting standards codification asc is considered the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  except for additional authoritative rules and interpretive releases issued by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the codification was developed to organize gaap pronouncements by topic so that users can more easily access authoritative accounting guidance 
this statement applies beginning in the third quarter 
all accounting references have been updated and  therefore  sfas references have been replaced with asc references 

table of contents asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies the guidance in fasb asc  and related guidance  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this guidance indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate relate d to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period and because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
there were no asset impairments recorded during the three years ended december  allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that cust omer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product liability accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product liability claims 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respe ctively 
for additional information regarding the company s product liability  refer to part ii  item  footnote commitments and contingent liabilities 
slow moving inventory the company maintains reserves for slow moving inventory 
these reserves  which are reviewed and adjusted routinely  take into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used in calculating the reserve can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
at december  and  the reserve for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual direct labor costs to estimated total direct labor costs 

table of contents as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with applicable guidance  generally fasb asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  applicable guidance requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was for and deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by fasb asc  income taxes  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this guidance requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
 the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation applies to all open tax positions and as been codified by the fasb in asc this guidance is intended to result in increased relevance and comparability in financial reporting of income taxes and to provide more information about the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
refer to part ii  item  footnote  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense and net income 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fsp fas r  employers disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets  which was codified as fasb asc and amended fasb statement r to require more detailed disclosures about employers pension plan assets 
new disclosures include more information on investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
this new standard required new disclosures only  and had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these new disclosures are included in note  retirement plans 
the company adopted changes issued by the fasb to accounting for business combinations beginning on january  fasb asc topic  business combinations  retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
topic was effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  the company adopted changes issued by the fasb to accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued on june  in june  the fasb issued changes to the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity vie 
fasb asc topic  consolidation  amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterp rise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
previously  fin r required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
qualifying special purpose entities  which were previously exempt from the application of this standard  will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective 
fasb asc also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
topic is effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin after november  in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to fasb asc  fair value measurements  that requires entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the disclosures related to level and level fair value measurements are effective for the company beginning in and the disclosures related to level fair value measureme nts are effective for the company in the update requires only new disclosures and will have no impact on the company s financial statements

the prior year period included a negative impact caused by increased product prices 
the declining inventory prices have partially offset the favorable impact from lifo by causing million of unfavorable inventory cost adjustments over the prior year period 
additionally  due to falling demand caused by the recession which lowered production levels  our gross profit margin was adversely impacted by million in increased manufacturing variances 
the fourth quarter decrease in selling and administrative expenses resulted from reduced incentive compensation expense  bad debt expense and travel and entertainment expenses 
decreased borrowings and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates led to reduced interest expense 
lower interest rates also contributed to reduced interest income earned on our various cash and cash equivalent instruments during the fourth quarter of income taxes in the current quarter were recorded at approximately  compared to the prior year period rate of due to a reduced manufacturing deduction and state return to provision adjustments

due to the general declining price environment and reduced volumes caused by the recession in  our gross profit was negatively impacted by market related inventory adjustments and increased unfavorable manufacturing variances 
these negative impacts were entirely mitigated by reduced lifo reserve requirements for the full year  while the prior year period included increased reserve requirements  and led to flat gross profit margins year over year 
the primary reasons for reduced selling and administrative costs were reduced incentive compensation  travel and entertainment expenses and bad debt expense 
as we operate in the current recessionary economic environment  we continue to control our selling  administrative and manufacturing costs through various cost reduction measures 
interest expense decreased from the prior year period due primarily to reduced borrowings and secondarily lower interest rates

two leading causes of our reduced gross profit relate to the following two specific issues at our concrete tie division 
the first is the cumulative impact during of approximately million in warranty charges related to in track failures of our prestressed concrete railroad ties 
the second is the million of gross profit charges associated with the rejection by the uprr of concrete railroad ties which contained below specification raw materials 
the remainder of the divisions experienced margin contraction during associated  generally  with demand and pricing declines with the exception of our allegheny rail products arp division 
the demand declines have resulted in de creased production volumes causing increased unabsorbed plant expenses and increased charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
notable unfavorable slow moving and obsolete inventory charges were million recorded by our rail distribution business and million by our concrete tie businesses 
the pricing declines have contributed to unfavorable inventory adjustments 
due to our expectations that class railroad capital spending will continue to be depressed  we anticipate continued weakness in our rail products segment sales and gross profit 
we anticipate the industrial market will remain weak in further hampering our sales of various rail products 
partially offsetting these weaknesses is our transit products division 
the strong popularity of mass transit systems coupled with stimulus legislation funding has led to a dramatic increase in this division s backlog 
the year compared to the year rail segment sales decreased primarily from the loss of our main track panel customer in the beginning of which ultimately led to the closure of our track panel plant in pueblo  co 
additionally  the reductions in the volume of orders for concrete ties negatively impacted our facilities in grand island  ne and tucson  az 
unfavorable market conditions have lowered our transit products sales while reducing our concrete turnout tie sales  produced in spokane  wa  compared to the prior year period 
partially offsetting these sales losses were stronger sales from our spokane  wa concrete tie facility where an increase in orders for cross ties led to the addition of a second production line in the fourth quarter of finally  increased orders from class railroads as well as an increa se in steel prices benefited our arp division 

table of contents a combination of the positive effects of changes in product mix offset by the negative effects of drastically decreasing scrap steel prices in the second half of led to an increase in gross profit margins within our rail distribution division 
increased billing margins and reduced obsolescence and plant inefficiencies coupled with volume increases drove the margin expansion within our arp division 
the reduction of inefficiencies our tucson  az concrete tie plant experienced during due to labor force turnover  concrete mix design and operational issues led to margin improvement 
partially offsetting this growth was the negative impact of sales volume reductions in track panels and concrete turnout ties

dollars in thousands net sales construction products gross profit construction products gross profit percentage the year compared to the year improved sales performance from both our fabricated products and concrete buildings divisions was entirely offset by significant sales declines by our piling division 
reduced demand caused by the nationwide softening in our heavy civil and public works construction markets led to reductions in sales volumes and pricing across most of our piling product offerings 
strong bridge activity drove the sales increases within our fabricated products division while increased new orders and sales provided growth within our concrete buildings division 
the impact of volume declines within our piling division and a declining price environment also contributed to the reduction of our construction products gross profit margin 
exclusive of the negative gross profit margin impacts from our piling division  the margins of the other divisions within this segment remained comparatively flat over the prior year period 
our heavy civil and public works construction markets remain soft nationwide 
however  we have seen opportunities generated from the stimulus bill 
however  we do not expect this activity to compensate for the shortfalls created by the economic downturn 
in addition to the current economic recession  a number of other factors are likely to impact our construction products segment sales and gross profit 
negative factors impacting these results include approximately states currently facing  or are projecting to have  fiscal year budget deficits  federal legislation  safetea lu  authorizing transportation construction funding which expired in september and has been temporarily extended through march and the heavy civil and public works construction market that we participate in remains soft nationwide leading to increased competition 
the year compared to the year all divisions within our construction products segment completed with improved sales over the prior year period led predominately by our piling division 
this improvement is attributable to both rising structural steel prices and the successful expansion throughout the north american market of engineered solutions for open cells  of which our flat sheet piling is a main component 
these increases more than offset decreases in sales of our h beam piling  due to reduced supplier production  and in pipe piling 
an increase in new orders and the completion of more unit installations during improved sales in our concrete buildings division 
lastly  an increased sales force in our fabricated products division fueled sales growth during the current period 

table of contents the increase in gross profit margin was led by volume related increases within our piling division for open cell systems  reduced less profitable h beam sales and an overall rising steel price environment during construction products also benefited from improved plant efficiencies within our concrete buildings division

dollars in thousands net sales tubular products gross profit tubular products gross profit percentage the year compared to the year significant weakness in the energy markets served by our tubular products segment has resulted in reductions in both our sales volumes as well as our profitability 
we currently anticipate the energy markets we serve will continue to be extremely weak into reductions in pipe pricing and unfavorable manufacturing variances have had significant  adverse affects to the gross profit margins in our threaded products division 
although our threaded products facility reported a temporary increase in volumes from our strategy involved with exiting the micropile market  due to falling prices and reduced demand  we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately million 
also  due to the slow down in market conditions  we recorded a charge of approximately million in this division related to slow moving inventory 
the year compared to the year our birmingham  al coated pipe facility had reduced sales compared to the record year experienced in partially mitigating this decrease were improved sales by our threaded products division in the micropile market and its ability to successfully pass raw material cost increases onto its customers 
the return to more normal volumes at our coated pipe facility resulted in reduced absorption of plant expenses and led to reduced gross profit compared to the prior year period

table of contents for more information regarding the sale of our investment in the dm e  please see our management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations in form k for the year ended december  outlook our businesses and results of operations have been impacted by the downturn in the global economy 
we believe that the recession  continued credit concerns and expected reductions in federal and state government tax receipts will present challenges to many of the end markets to which we sell 
as a result of anticipated reduced demand for certain of our products as well as heightened competition  we expect to battle margin compression for at least the next six months and we implemented certain additional cost reduction measures in september in anticipation of these concerns 
as activity levels have remained constrained  we reduced our salaried workforce and implemented additional plant personnel reductions 
we expect to be challenged into by reduced sales volumes  reduced productio n volumes and heightened competition caused by the recessionary economic environment 
however  we also expect to be profitable and to generate positive cash flow 
we believe that when conditions do improve  and we do not know when that might be  the markets we participate in will be poised to benefit
