item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those under the caption forward looking information in item overview in the second quarter  we made a strategic decision to rationalize our product lines and exit the specialty print and direct mail market  choosing to focus our resources on our growing custom folding carton line 
as a result of the rationalization  we expect to realize significant improvement in operating performance as we had not realized the results that we had anticipated in the specialty print and direct mail market over the last four years 
in addition  we expect that we can be more effective in sales and marketing in the custom folding carton market with a more focused approach 
our custom folding carton customers are generally in the healthcare  confectionary  food and food service  and automotive industries  including private label manufacturers 
our expertise in this market is our ability to run on demand the specific quantities required by our customers as opposed to doing long runs and creating inventory and obsolescence challenges either for our customers or ourselves 
as a result  we do not require minimum print orders and are more flexible than most printers in addressing our customers needs 
this capability has served extremely well for our private label customers who may have several of the same carton requirements with varying print requirements for their customers 
we also plan to continue developing our stock packaging and personalized print product lines 
our stock packaging line serves primarily private confectionaries and  therefore is seasonal in nature and driven by the economy 
during this current state of the economy  sales in stock packages have declined measurably 
our personalized print product line is focused on its store  catalog and web sales 
because we provide products such as personalized dinner and cocktail napkins  small boxes for sundries at events  and other celebration type items both for the retail and corporate markets  this product line is also heavily impacted by economic downturns 
nonetheless  we believe that in the stock packaging market  we are a leader with over  customers that we serve around the world 
also  in personalized print where we compete with much larger companies  we have developed a strong brand as krepe kraft among event planners and wedding coordinators 
our website  www 
partybasics 
com  has had some success  and we also provide our products to third party web stores as well

we had access to an million committed line of credit with a commercial bank throughout most of as the fourth quarter of ended  it was determined that we would have violated our financial covenants at year end
