item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial conditions and results of operations 
the information in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto  which appear in item of this form k 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding first savings bank as provided in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  the financial information presented in this section reflects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of first financial northwest and its subsidiaries 
overview first savings bank is a community based savings bank primarily serving king and to a lesser extent  pierce  kitsap and snohomish counties  washington through our full service banking office located in renton  washington 
we are in the business of attracting deposits from the public through our office and utilizing those deposits to originate loans 
our current business strategy includes an emphasis on one to four family residential mortgage  multifamily and commercial real estate lending 
until recently  we had also included construction land development lending in our business strategy 
we have deemphasized this type of lending over the past two years as a result of market conditions although these types of loans represented approximately of our loan portfolio at december  first savings bank s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing these funds to originate one to four family  multifamily  construction land development  commercial real estate  business and consumer loans 
continuing adverse conditions in the national and local economics have resulted in a challenging operating environment for financial institutions  particularly in the pacific northwest 
during  the national residential lending market has experienced worsening conditions as loan delinquencies and foreclosure rates have risen to unprecedented volumes 
the national delinquency rate for one to four family residential loans days or more delinquent was and the percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started based on annualized third quarter of data was  according to the national delinquency survey published by the mortgage bankers association 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income 
since first savings bank is liability sensitive  meaning its liabilities reprice at a faster rate than its interest earning assets  the lower interest rate environment that we are currently experiencing has contributed to an improvement in our net interest rate spread 
during our provision for loan losses totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase in the provision was attributable to the increase in nonperforming loans  the continued depressed real estate values  the uncertain economic environment in our market area  the anticipated increase in fdic liquidations in the pacific northwest and the effect it will have on our market area  the level of charge offs during and the increase in the number of requests for loan modifications 
we will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our allowance for loan losses as we deem necessary 
our operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  marketing  postage and supplies  professional services and deposit insurance premiums 
compensation and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of building and equipment  consist primarily of real estate taxes  depreciation charges  maintenance and costs of utilities 
our noninterest expenses increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we conducted a review of the carrying value of our goodwill resulting from the acquisition of executive house  a mortgage banking business  which we acquired in december this review concluded that it was appropriate to record an impairment loss for this entire asset as a result of the continued decline in the economic environment 
business strategy we are a community oriented savings bank whose focus for the past several years has been primarily to gather deposits to fund a diversified mix of residential mortgage loans  commercial and multifamily real estate loans and construction land development loans 
our business strategy is to operate and grow first savings bank as a well capitalized and profitable community bank  offering primarily one to four family mortgage loans  commercial and multifamily real estate loans and to a lesser extent construction land development loans along with a diversified array of deposits and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas 
we intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise  capital strength and mortgage production capability by capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers  delivering a consistent and high quality level of professional service  offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to expand our core deposits  diversifying the deposit mix by growing lower cost deposits  attracting new customers and expanding first financial northwest s footprint in the geographical area it serves  managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentrations and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio  managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss to first savings bank  and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin  and improving our overall efficiency and profitability 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for analyzing the allowance for loan losses consists of two components formula and specific allowances 
the formula allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans 
management considers factors such as charge off history  the prevailing economy  borrower s ability to repay  the regulatory environment  competition  geographic and loan type concentrations  policy and underwriting standards  nature and volume of the loan portfolio  management s experience level  our loan review and grading system  the value of underlying collateral  the level of problem loans  business conditions and credit concentrations in assessing the allowance for loan losses 
the specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectibility of a specific loan  such as a construction land development  multifamily  business or commercial real estate loan  has been impaired and a loss is probable 
the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any and costs to sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
our board of directors approves the provision for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period earnings and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional information see the section titled our provision for loan losses has increased substantially and we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations  within the section titled item a 
risk factors in this form k 
valuation of oreo and foreclosed assets 
real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors  including third party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale 
accordingly  the valuation of oreo is subject to significant external and internal judgment 
any differences between management s assessment of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and the carrying value of the loan at the date a particular property is transferred into oreo are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically reviews oreo values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value  net of estimated costs to sell 
any further decreases in the value of oreo are considered valuation adjustments and trigger a corresponding charge to noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
expenses from the maintenance and operations of oreo are included in noninterest expense 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a expenses  such as our charitable contribution to the first financial northwest foundation  that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c writedowns in the value of assets for book purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount which can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards 
the level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management s assessment of our historic and future profitability profile 
at each balance sheet date  existing assessments are reviewed and  if necessary  revised to reflect changed circumstances 
in a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred  the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity 
see item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note federal taxes on income 
other than temporary impairments in the market value of investments 
declines in the fair value of any available for sale or held to maturity investment below their cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment to that of fair value 
a charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made 
unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition in income 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates  there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer 
an unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to current market conditions and not deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or an equity security is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position  actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security  the financial condition  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisors or market analysts 
therefore continued deterioration of market conditions could result in additional impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
at december   total assets increased million to billion from december  this increase in total assets was primarily the result of increases in cash and interest bearing deposits  offset by decreases in investments available for sale and the write off of goodwill 
total liabilities increased million to billion at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of increases in our deposits 
stockholders equity decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of a net loss for the year 
assets

loan originations for the year ended december  totaled million and included million in one to four family mortgages  million each for commercial real estate and multifamily loans  and million in consumer loans 
included in the one to four family residential loan originations were million of permanent loans where the builders have financed homes that are or will be rented by third parties 
we also originated million in construction related loans to our merchant builders so they could continue to complete their projects and utilize their existing land inventory and  in business loans 
our investments available for sale decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   we sold million of investments 
gross proceeds from the sales were million with net gains of million 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge during reducing the investment portfolio by  for the year ended december   we purchased million of principally fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage backed securities to utilize our excess liquidity 
our nonperforming loans increased to million at december  from million at december  as a percentage of our total loan portfolio  net of undisbursed funds  the amount of nonperforming loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets december  amount of percent of change change dollars in thousands one to four family residential commercial real estate construction land development consumer total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets the majority of these loans are related to our merchant builders rental properties 
the undisbursed funds related to our nonperforming loans totaled million 
the foregone interest during the year ended december  relating to all nonperforming loans  totaled million 
during the latter part of  we shifted our strategy  related to nonperforming loans  from promoting builder partnering solutions to a bank directed solutions approach 
these solutions included foreclosures  short sales and accepting deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
this approach has resulted in first savings bank foreclosing on million of real estate during we anticipate continued foreclosure activity in while we work with our nonperforming loan customers to minimize our loss exposure 
management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled 
the analysis usually occurs when a loan has been negatively classified or placed on nonaccrual status 
if the current value  collateral value less costs to sell  of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  impairment is recognized by establishing a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the loan or by adjusting an existing allocation 
deposits 
during the year ended december   deposits increased million to million at december  the increase in deposits was the result of customers saving more due to the current economic conditions combined with our practice of competitively pricing our deposit products 
we experienced increases in all deposit categories 
the amount of these deposit increases are as follows certificates of deposit million  savings accounts million  money market accounts million  now accounts million and noninterest bearing accounts  we did not have any brokered deposits at december  and advances 
we use advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle as an alternative funding source to deposits to manage funding costs  reduce interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet 
the net effect was to fund increases in total interest earning assets  thereby incrementally increasing our net interest income 
total advances at december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from december  the decrease in advances was related to the excess liquidity generated from investment sales being utilized to repay some of our advances to manage our funding costs 
stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily a result of the net loss of million  the repurchase of million shares of stock for million and the payment of cash dividends to shareholders of million during the year ended december  comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general

the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any  and sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans outstanding  net of undisbursed funds at december  as compared to million or of total loans outstanding  net of undisbursed funds at december  a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  the comparable provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled million

the construction land development loans are to homebuilders whose sales have been affected by the challenging economic conditions 
the majority of the one to four family residential loans are related to our merchant builder rental properties 
the increase in the loss provision during was the result of the increase in our nonperforming loans  the continued depressed real estate values  the uncertain economic environment in our market area  the anticipated increases in fdic liquidations in the pacific northwest and the effect it will have on our market area  the level of charge offs during and the increase in the number of requests for loan modifications 
although we believe that we used the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions  the level of problem loans  business conditions  credit concentrations  increased loan balances  or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio 
in addition  the determination of the amount of first savings bank s allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination

our analysis of the million in nonperforming construction land development loans resulted in a specific allocation of the allowance 
based on our analysis of these loans  which included the review of either existing or updated appraisals as well as adjustments to those appraisals for deteriorating market conditions  we established an million specific allowance for these loans 
we did not have any real estate owned at december  or deposits

net interest income 
our net interest income increased million for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the million increase in our average loans receivable partially offset by a basis point decrease in our average yield on our loan portfolio

the average balance of advances from the federal home loan bank decreased million at december  compared to december  the average cost of advances and the related interest expense decreased basis points and million  respectively 
our average balance in advances from the federal home loan bank decreased primarily because our loan volume for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  deposit interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the average balance of money market accounts decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the average balance of certificates of deposit increased million at december  to million from million at december  the average cost of certificates of deposit decreased basis points reflecting the lower interest rate environment during the year 
the majority of the decrease in money market accounts was transfers to certificate of deposit accounts within first savings bank because our certificate of deposit products were priced higher than our money market products 
the remaining growth in our certificates of deposit was the result of higher interest rates offered relative to other investment products in the current interest rate environment 
provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans outstanding  net of undisbursed funds at december  as compared to million or of total loans outstanding  net of undisbursed funds at december  a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  the comparable provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled million

the construction land development loans are to homebuilders whose sales have been affected by the current credit tightening 
the builder that was identified in the fourth quarter of who was experiencing financial difficulties continues to make progress in advancing on his projects as well as making some housing sales 
the outstanding loan balance net of undisbursed funds for this relationship totaled million at december  although we believe that we used the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments to the allowance for loan losses and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstance differ substantially from the assumptions used in determining the allowance 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions  the level of problem loans  business conditions  credit concentrations  increased loan balances  or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio 
in addition  the determination of the amount of first savings bank s allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination

the majority of the increase in compensation and benefits was attributable to the establishment of first financial northwest s equity compensation plans  a general increase in salaries  and the continued improvement in the depth and quality of our staff and our overall infrastructure and the hiring of an additional full time employees 
the equity compensation plans include first financial northwest s employee stock ownership plan and the equity incentive plan 
in july  stock options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were issued to our directors and employees at a weighted average price of per share 
in addition  under our stock based incentive plan we awarded approximately  shares of restricted stock to eligible participants  which will be expensed as the awards vest over five years 
see note benefit plans included in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item professional fees increased  for the year ended december  from the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of our incurring expenses related to the additional reporting requirements and internal control compliance required by us as a publicly owned company 
since was the first complete year of being a publicly owned company  we incurred expenses for the filing of all three quarterly filings on form qs along with this filing on form k 
in addition we incurred professional expense for stockholder related matters such as press releases  a stockholders meeting  etc 
also during we incurred costs to implement and comply with the sarbanes oxley act regarding internal controls 
a portion of the expenses related to the sarbanes oxley implementation were one time charges totaling approximately  a one time contribution totaling million for the first financial northwest foundation was made as part of our conversion to a stock owned company in  no such contribution was made in federal income tax expense 
federal income tax expense increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to a tax benefit of million for the comparable period in the increase was mainly due to the million deferred tax valuation allowance related to the charitable contribution and the capital loss on the mutual fund

our board of directors has established an asset liability management policy to guide management in maximizing net interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity  capital adequacy  interest rate sensitivity  credit risk and profitability 
the policy includes the use of an asset liability management committee whose members include certain members of senior management 
the committee s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and manage our asset liability positions consistent with our business plan and board approved policies  as well as to price savings and lending products  and to develop new products 
the asset liability management committee meets monthly to review various areas including economic conditions  interest rate outlook  asset liability mix  interest rate risk sensitivity  current market opportunities to promote specific products  historical financial results  projected financial results  and capital position 
the committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs  although not necessarily on a monthly basis 
as part of its procedures  the asset liability management committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the board of directors 
our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
we have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have structured our borrowings with relatively short terms to maturity to match fund our construction land development loan portfolio  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits which typically fund our long term assets  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally three to five years 
how we measure the risk of interest rate changes 
we monitor first savings bank s interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis to measure the change in net interest income as a percentage of net income in varying rate environments 
management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates 
although management believes these assumptions are reasonable  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from these assumptions 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates 
non uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure 
the assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  prepayments  deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
we use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans  investments and borrowings  and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits 
time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities 
we also assume that non maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates  based upon our historical deposit decay rates which are substantially lower than market decay rates 
we have demonstrated in the past that the tiering structure of our deposit accounts during changing rate environments results in relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes in our interest expense for deposits 
we tier our deposit accounts by balance and rate  whereby higher balances within an account earn higher rates of interest 
therefore  deposits that are not very rate sensitive generally  lower balance tiers are separated from deposits that are rate sensitive generally  higher balance tiers 
when interest rates rise  we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits 
these assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base  competitive factors and historical experience 
the following table illustrates the change in the net portfolio value at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest movement 
net portfolio as of basis point net portfolio value portfolio value of assets market value change in rates amount change change npv ratio change of assets dollars in thousands the current federal funds rate is  making a and basis point drop unlikely 
the net portfolio value is calculated based upon the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
the difference between the present value of assets and liabilities is the net portfolio value and represents the market value of equity for the given interest rate scenario 
net portfolio value is useful for determining  on a market value basis  how much equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios 
large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams 
represents the increase decrease in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated change in interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates 
calculated as the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets net portfolio value ratio 
calculated as the increase decrease in the net portfolio value ratio assuming the indicated change in interest rates over the estimated portfolio value of assets assuming no change in interest rates 
calculated based on the present value of the discounted cash flows from assets 
the market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes 
when interest rates decline by basis points  our net interest income gradually increases because our earning assets are primarily long term fixed rate loans and the rate we earn decreases at a slower pace than the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
interest income would decrease on our interest earning assets primarily because of increased prepayment risks that would emerge 
we expect that our interest expense would decrease because of the sensitivity of our money market liabilities which are tied to the day u 
s 
treasury bill rate 
furthermore  the rate we pay on the majority of our deposits and on some borrowed funds cannot decline basis points in the event of an immediate change in market interest rates  since some of our interest bearing liabilities have interest rate floors 
when interest rates rise by  or basis points  our net interest income and the net portfolio value decreases because the rate we earn on our interest earning assets does not increase as rapidly as the rates we would pay on our interest bearing liabilities which in some cases are subject to interest rate floors 
our interest earning assets primarily consist of intermediate term and longer term loans that do not reprice quickly and investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
our interest bearing liabilities generally consist of short term deposits savings  money market  and certificates of deposit and short to intermediate term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle that would reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
the net interest income and net portfolio value tables presented above are predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in asset or liability mix 
in addition  the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows 
the effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and  for purposes of simplifying the analysis  assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
delinquency rates may change when interest rates change  as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix  underwriting conditions  loan terms  or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio 
the model we use does not change the delinquency rate for the various interest rate scenarios 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as set forth above 
also  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above 
liquidity we are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation 
we maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
on a daily basis  we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
our primary sources of funds are from customer deposits  loan repayments  maturing investment securities and advances from the federal home loan bank of seattle 
these funds  together with equity  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets  and fund continuing operations 
while maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we believe that our current liquidity position  and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as overnight deposits or mortgage backed securities 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under business of first savings bank lending activities 
at december   the total approved loan origination commitments outstanding amounted to million 
at the same date  the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process totaled million and unused lines of credit were million 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals  to fund loan commitments and to maintain our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million 
management s policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions 
based on historical experience  we believe that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with first savings bank 
in addition  we had the ability at december  to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of seattle as a funding source to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes 
in addition  first savings bank maintained credit facilities with the federal reserve bank of san francisco totaling million and one line of credit totaling million with another financial institution 
there were no outstanding balances for these lines of credit at december  and we measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due 
liquidity and funding risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices  or in a reasonable time frame  to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations 
we regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage effectively our liquidity and funding requirements 
our primary source of funds is our deposits 
when deposits are not available to provide the funds for our assets  we use alternative funding sources 
these sources include  but are not limited to cash management from the federal home loan bank of seattle  wholesale funding  brokered deposits  federal funds purchased and dealer repurchase agreements  as well as other short term alternatives 
alternatively  we may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the coming three month  six month  and one year time periods 
also  we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits 
this information is used by our asset liability management committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities 
capital our total stockholders equity was million at december  consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain a well capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards 
as of december  first savings bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
regulatory capital ratios for first savings bank were as follows as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets was  tier i capital to risk weighted assets was  and tier i capital to average assets was 
the regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized are   and  respectively 
see item  business how we are regulated regulation and supervision of first savings bank capital requirements 
we have completed construction of the adjacent building to our headquarters and as of mid february  our lending operations have been relocated to this building 
for the year ended december   we have accrued million and anticipate capitalizing on additional million in related to this project 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and the unused portions of lines of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
commitments to extend credit and lines of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised 
at december  and  we had no commitments to originate loans for sale 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
the amount and type of collateral required varies  but may include real estate and income producing commercial properties 
the following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans  to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding lines of credit and to disburse funds related to our construction loans at december  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed through one year after one through three years after three through five years after five years in thousands commitments to originate loans unused portion of lines of credit undisbursed portion of construction loans total commitments first financial northwest and its subsidiaries from time to time are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there are currently no matters that in the opinion of management  would have a material adverse effect on first financial northwest s consolidated financial position  results of operation  or liquidity 
among our contingent liabilities are exposures to limited recourse arrangements with respect to sales of whole loans and participation interests 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of noninterest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
our management is unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation
