item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements 
the results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
certain statements in this discussion and analysis  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance  and revenue sources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  including those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies investment valuations our loans receivable  net of participations and any unearned discount are considered investment securities under the act and are recorded at fair value 
as part of fair value methodology  loans are valued at cost adjusted for any unrealized appreciation depreciation 
since no ready market exists for these loans  the fair value is determined in good faith by management  and approved by the board of directors 
in determining the fair value  we and our board of directors consider factors such as the financial condition of borrower  the adequacy of the collateral  individual credit risks  historical loss experience  and the relationships between current and projected market rates and portfolio rates of interest and maturities 
foreclosed properties  which represent collateral received from defaulted borrowers  are valued based on appraisals prepared by third parties and market analysis 
loans are  generally  considered non performing once they become days past due as to principal or interest 
the value of past due loans are periodically determined in good faith by management  and if  in the judgment of management  the amount is not collectible and the fair value of the collateral is less than the amount due  the value of the loan will be reduced to fair value 
equity investments preferred stock  common stock  llc interests  lp interest  and stock warrants  including controlled subsidiary portfolio investments and investment securities are recorded at fair value  represented as cost  plus or minus unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such quoted amounts 
if no public market exists  the fair value of investments that have no ready market are determined in good faith by management  and approved by the board of directors  based upon assets and revenues of the underlying investee companies as well as general market trends for businesses in the same industry 
we record the investment in life insurance policies at fair value  represented as cost  plus or minus unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
the fair value of the investment in life settlement contracts have no ready market and are determined in good faith by management  and approved by the board of directors  based on actuarial life expectancy  including health evaluations 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations  our estimates of the values of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed  and the differences could be material 
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans assets acquired in satisfaction of loans are carried at the lower of the net value of the related foreclosed loan or the estimated fair value less cost of disposal 
losses incurred at the time of foreclosure are charged to the unrealized depreciation on loans receivable 
subsequent reductions in estimated net realizable value are charged to operations as losses on assets acquired in satisfaction of loans 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the fair value of our investments 
income recognition interest income  including interest on loans in default  is recorded on an accrual basis and in accordance with loan terms to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
we recognize interest income on loans classified as non performing only to the extent that the fair market value of the related collateral exceeds the specific loan principal balance 
loans that are not fully collateralized and in the process of collection are placed on nonaccrual status when  in the judgment of management  the collectability of interest and principal is doubtful 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings in the course of our daily operations from enforcement of our rights in disputes pursuant to the terms of various contractual arrangements 
we may assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters as well as a potential range of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserve required  if any  for these contingencies may be made after analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income our investment income for the year ended june   decreased  or to  as compared with the prior year s investment income of  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest income of  the decrease in interest income is primarily due to the reduction of income producing assets under management as a result of the sale of medallion loans as compared to the year ended june   and a reduction in interest rates received on variable rate loans 
commercial loans outstanding decreased by  or  to  as compared with the prior year s amount of  of this decrease  approximately million relates to repayments and  is due to a sale of a foreclosed asset

operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  decreased  or to  when compared to  for the year ended june  interest expense decreased due primarily to declines in interest rates for our variable rate borrowings  as well as the payoff of our credit lines in october  following the sale of our medallion loans 
at june   overall bank borrowings were unchanged at  at june  and june  salaries and employee benefits decreased  or to  in fiscal as compared with  for the prior fiscal year

net unrealized depreciation on investments during the year ended june   our investments had a net unrealized depreciation of approximately  compared with  in the prior fiscal year 
the net unrealized depreciation for the year ended june  is primarily due to decreases in the fair value of certain investments in our portfolio 
an unrealized write down of  in our corporate loan portfolio was the largest component of unrealized depreciation 
other significant factors were a write down of the fair value of a commercial loan receivable of  to reflect our estimate of the recoverable value in the related collateral  a  decrease in the fair value of our life settlement portfolio to reflect the estimated recovery value based on current market conditions 
partially offsetting these items was approximately  of investment value that was reclassified as realized losses and an increase in value of our equity investments of approximately  almost all of which was attributable to appreciation of a real estate investment of approximately  net increase decrease in net assets from operations net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  of balance sheet total assets increased by million to million as of june  when compared to total assets of million as of june  this increase was primarily due to an increase in cash of approximately million and an increase in other assets of approximately  as partially offset by a decrease in investments of approximately million 
the increase in assets was partially offset by an increase in liabilities of approximately million  from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  this increase in liabilities is primarily attributable to an increase in debentures payable to the sba of approximately million  an increase in notes payable  other of million and an increase in accrued expenses and other payables aggregating approximately  including approximately  accrued for the dividend on our preferred stock 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income our investment income for the year ended june   decreased  or to  as compared with the prior year ended june  the decrease is primarily due to decreases in interest income of  the decrease in interest income is primarily due to the reduction of income producing assets under management  as a result of the sale of medallion loans as compared to the year ended june   and a reduction in interest rates received on variable rate loans

operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  decreased  or to  when compared to the year ended june  interest expense decreased due to a net decrease in average bank borrowings over the course of the year ended june  at june   overall bank borrowings had a net decrease of  as compared to the prior year ended june  due to the use of proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the medallion loan portfolio to pay down existing bank debt 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or to  when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the costs associated with a onetime payment to an officer during the year ended june  pursuant to the restructuring of his employment agreement as well as increases due under various other employment agreements 
occupancy costs increased  or  to  when compared with the year ended june  due to rent increases on our new york city office  as well as increased general overhead expense 
professional fees increased approximately  or  to approximately million  when compared with the prior year amount of approximately  this increase was due to increases of recent fees of approximately  for an out sourced controller  consulting fees related to compliance with sarbanes oxley of  audit and audit related fees of  non related party legal fees of  largely due to the write off of certain prepaid offering expense  and prepaid fee expense totaling 
additional legal fees were incurred in fiscal in connection with life settlement related matters of approximately  these increases were partially offset by decreases in related party legal fees of approximately  and decrease in legal fees related to chicago medallion loans of approximately  other administrative expenses decreased approximately  or to approximately  when compared with the prior year 
this net decrease in other administrative expense was due to the following reductions service fees of  outside help of  recruiting fees of  application fees of  custodial fees of  association dues of  and other miscellaneous decreases aggregating  these decreases were partially offset by increases in market data fees of  website and computer fees of  nasdaq fees of  advertising and promotion expense of  and miscellaneous increases totaling  advisory fees in fiscal were  in december  the company entered into an advisory agreement with velocity to provide investment advice with respect to our corporate loan portfolio 
net realized loss on investments the components of realized gains and losses were as follows a loss of approximately  related to the sale of our interest in a sanitaryware distributor  a loss of approximately  associated with the sale of our taxicab medallion portfolio  the loss of approximately  associated with the foreclosure and sale of a commercial loan  the loss of approximately  associated with the foreclosure and sale of the collateral associated with a commercial loan  and other miscellaneous losses of approximately  offsetting these amounts was approximately  associated with the reversal of certain reserves for assets acquired which were subsequently sold 
net unrealized depreciation on investments during the year ended june   our investments had a net unrealized depreciation of approximately  the net unrealized depreciation for the year ended june  is primarily due to decreases in the fair value of certain investments in our portfolio 
an unrealized write down of  in our life settlement portfolio was the largest component of unrealized depreciation 
other significant factors were a write down of the fair value of a loan receivable of  to reflect our estimate of its recoverable value in the collateral underlying the loan  a  decrease in the fair value of a loan to reflect the actual recovery achieved on that loan following the resale of the property subsequent to june  also contributing to unrealized depreciation was a  reduction in the value of our llc interest in a condominium construction project  a  net reduction in the fair value of the various real estate limited partnership investments 
offsetting these items was approximately  of investment value that was reclassified as realized losses 
net increase decrease in net assets from operations net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  was  as compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended june  of asset liability management interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent our interest earning assets rise or fall at a different rate over time in comparison to our interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of our credit facilities with banks and subordinated sba debentures  which currently have fixed rates of interest 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from ameritrans interest rate sensitivity gap  ie the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
our interest rate sensitive assets were  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at june   which were subsequently paid in full in august having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on the average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest ra te sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  ameritrans anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
ameritrans believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
interest rate swap agreements ameritrans manages the exposure of its portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures 
on october   elk entered into two interest rate swap transactions for  each  with expiration dates of october  and october   respectively 
as a portion of our loan portfolio is at fixed rates  elk entered into these swap transactions to hedge against an upward movement in interest rates relating to outstanding bank debt 
the swaps expired on october  and october   respectively 
the swap transaction that expired october   provided for a fixed rate of 
as of june  and  we were not a party to any interest rate swaps 
investment considerations in the fiscal year ended june   our investment income was negatively affected by historically low libor due to the federal reserve s decrease in interest rates and the general dislocation of credit markets 
this low interest rate had a direct result on the actual rate of interest we received on our outstanding corporate loans  and to a lesser extent  certain commercial loans 
the dollar amount of our adjustable rate loans receivable at june  was approximately million with the remainder of million being fixed rate loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the differences between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we lend funds 
while many of the loans in our portfolio bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we may  in the future  finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates 
as short term interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
however  a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business over time 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners who have limited resources and who are generally unable to obtain financing from banks or other primary sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions  or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations through private and public placements of our securities  bank financing  the issuance to the sba of our subordinated debentures and internally generated funds 
we entered into a loan purchase agreement dated july  with medallion financial corp 
and medallion bank pursuant to which we sold substantially all of our taxicab medallion loans 
we used the proceeds of sale to pay down our bank lines 
because our banks notified us that our then existing loan agreements permit business loans secured by real estate or equipment  but not investments in corporate loans  we are seeking other sources of financing for our corporate loan strategy 
at june   we had working capital of approximately million  of which approximately million is restricted pursuant to sba regulations 
at june   or  of our indebtedness was attributable to the debentures issued to the sba wit h fixed rates of interest plus user fees which results in rates ranging from to  or million of our indebtedness was represented by notes sold in a private placement with a fixed rate of interest of and or  of our indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to our banks with interest rates of approximately 
elk currently may borrow additional amounts from banks subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba and the availability of future bank credit lines 
contractual obligations expire or mature at various dates through march  the following table shows all contractual obligations at june payments due by period less than year years years years years more than years total floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings operating lease obligations including overhead total our sources of liquidity are credit lines with banks  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  private sources of debt and equity capital and loan amortization and prepayment 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
like elk  ameritrans will distribute at least of its investment company taxable income and  accordingly  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management and the board of directors to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms 
at june   we had cash on hand and cash equivalents aggregating approximately million and working capital of approximately million  of which approximately million is restricted pursuant to sba regulations 
we will require additional sources of capital and new bank lines of credit and cash flow from operations to fund our business plan 
as a result  we continue to explore additional options  including cost reductions and obtaining additional financing  which may increase available funds for our growth and expansion of this strategy 
such financing may not be available or available on attractive terms and thus may adversely affect our plans and strategies 
nevertheless  we believe that we have sufficient resources currently available to sustain our business for  at least  the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our businesses 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
we value our portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors in accordance with our valuation policy 
we must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
we record unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when we believe that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of our portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
we adjust the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect our board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each component of the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
also  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation might be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan and invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
as interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general increases in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted by applying such theorietical increase to both our million variable rate loans receivable portfolio and our  bank debt in an additional net increase in net assets from operations of  at june  this is comprised of an increase of interest on loans receivable of  as partially offset by a  increase in interest on our bank debt
