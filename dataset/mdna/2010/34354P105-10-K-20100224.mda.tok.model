our intent is to be a market leader in the application of advanced technology to improve product performance and return on investment for our customers 
competition despite the consolidation trend in recent years  the markets for our products remain fragmented and highly competitive  with primary competitive drivers being price  reputation  timeliness of delivery and technical expertise  as well as contractual terms and previous installation history 
in the pursuit of large capital projects  competitive drivers and competition vary depending on the industry and products involved 
industries experiencing slow growth generally tend to have a competitive environment more heavily influenced by price due to supply outweighing demand  and price competition tends to be more significant for original equipment orders than aftermarket services 
considering the domestic and global economic environments in and current forecasts for  pricing was and may continue to be a particularly influential competitive factor 
the unique competitive environments in each of our three business segments are discussed in more detail under the business segments heading below 
in the aftermarket portion of our business  we compete against large and well established national and global competitors and  in some markets  against regional and local companies who produce low cost replications of spare parts 
in the oil and gas industry  the primary competitors for aftermarket services tend to be customers own in house capabilities 
in the nuclear power generation industry  we possess certain competitive advantages due to our n stamp certification  which is a prerequisite to serve customers in that industry  and our considerable base of proprietary knowledge 
in other industries  the competitors for aftermarket services tend to be local independent repair shops and low cost replicators 
aftermarket competition for standardized products is aggressive due to the existence of common standards allowing for easier replacement or repair of the installed products 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from our large installed base of pumps  valves and seals  which continually require maintenance  repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate 
timeliness of delivery  quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services 
in geographic 
table of contents regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response  customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized products 
generally  our customers attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase  thereby reducing the size and diversity of their inventory 
although vendor reduction programs could adversely affect our business  we have been successful in establishing long term supply purchasing agreements with a number of customers 
while the majority of these agreements do not provide us with exclusive rights  they can provide us a preferred status with our customers and thereby increase opportunities to win future business 
we also utilize our lifecycle advantage program to establish fee based contracts to manage customers aftermarket requirements 
these programs provide an opportunity to manage the customer s installed base and expand the business relationship with the customer 
our ability to use our portfolio of products  solutions and services to meet customer needs is a competitive strength 
our market approach is to create value for our customers throughout the lifecycle of their investments in flow management 
we continue to explore and develop potential new offerings in conjunction with our customers 
in the early phases of project design  we endeavor to create value in optimizing the selection of equipment for the customer s specific application  as we are capable of providing technical expertise on product and system capabilities even outside the scope of our specific products  solutions and services 
after the equipment is constructed and delivered to the customer s site  we continue to create value through our aftermarket capabilities by optimizing the performance of the equipment over its operational life 
our skilled service personnel can provide these aftermarket services for our products  as well as many competitors products  within the installed base 
this value is further enhanced by the global reach of our qrcs and  when combined with our other solutions for our customers flow management needs  allows us to create value for our customers during all phases of the capital expenditure cycle 
new product development we spent million  million and million during  and  respectively  on research and development initiatives 
our research and development group consists of engineers involved in new product development and improvement of existing products 
additionally  we sponsor consortium programs for research with various universities and jointly conduct limited development work with certain vendors  licensees and customers 
we believe current expenditures are adequate to sustain our ongoing and necessary future research and development activities 
in addition  we work closely with our customers on customer sponsored research activities to help execute their research and development initiatives in connection with our products and services 
new product development in each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the business segments heading below 
customers we sell to a wide variety of customers globally in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water management  and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries 
no individual customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues 
customer information relating to each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the business segments heading below 
we are not normally required to carry unusually high amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements  although higher shipment levels and longer lead times usually require higher amounts of inventory 
we have been working to increase our overall inventory efficiency to improve our operational effectiveness and reduce working capital needs 
while we do provide cancellation policies through our contractual relationships  we generally do not provide rights of product return for our customers 
selling and distribution we primarily distribute our products through direct sales by employees assigned to specific regions  industries or products 
in addition  we use distributors and sales representatives to supplement our direct sales force in countries where it is more appropriate due to business practices or customs  or whenever the use of direct sales staff 
table of contents is not economically efficient 
we generate a majority of our sales leads through existing relationships with vendors  customers and prospects or through referrals 
intellectual property we own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products 
we consider our trademarks and patents to be an important aspect of our business 
in addition  our pool of proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets related to the design  manufacture and operation of our products  is considered particularly valuable 
accordingly  we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information 
we generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are unencumbered by licensing or franchise agreements 
our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use  whereas our existing patents generally expire years from the dates they were filed  which has occurred at various times in the past

risk factors any of the events discussed as risk factors below may occur 
if they do  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
because of these risk factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
our business depends on the levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers  which in turn are affected by numerous factors  including the state of domestic and global economies  global energy demand  the cyclical nature of their markets  their liquidity and the condition of global credit and capital markets 
demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures by our customers depends  in turn  on general economic conditions  availability of credit  economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior 
additionally  volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 
the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industry  such as the condition of global credit and capital markets 
the businesses of many of our customers  particularly oil and gas companies  chemical companies and general industrial companies  are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns 
our customers in these industries  particularly those whose demand for our products and services is primarily profit driven  historically have tended to delay large capital projects  including expensive maintenance and upgrades  during economic downturns 
for example  our chemical customers generally tend to reduce their spending on capital investments and operate their facilities at lower levels in a soft economic environment  which reduces demand for our products and services 
additionally  while oil and gas prices have recently recovered somewhat from their lows  fluctuating energy demand forecasts and lingering uncertainty concerning commodity pricing can cause our customers to be more conservative in their capital planning  which may reduce demand for our products and services 
reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity  which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in our industry 
any of these results could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  some of our customers may delay capital investment and maintenance even during favorable conditions in their markets 
disruptions in global financial markets and banking systems experienced in continue to create difficulties in accessing credit and capital markets  and the costs of newly raised debt have generally increased 
continued difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects  including necessary maintenance and upgrades  even during favorable market conditions 
in addition  the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full and or on a timely basis 
any of these factors  whether individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our customers and  in turn  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
continuing volatility in commodity prices  prolonged credit and capital market disruptions and a sluggish global economic recovery could prompt customers to delay or cancel existing orders  which could adversely affect the viability of our backlog and could impede our ability to realize revenues on our backlog 
the increased levels of disruption experienced by credit and capital markets around the globe in the latter half of and continuing through has included  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  reduced levels of liquidity and credit availability and declining and uncertain valuations 
these disruptions  when combined with the volatility in commodity prices that has also been experienced  have contributed to a significant 
table of contents decrease in the rate of general economic growth 
while global economic conditions stabilized generally in the latter half of  a sluggish global economic recovery or extended slowing of global economic activity could adversely affect the businesses of our customers  which could potentially result in delays or cancellations of orders for our products 
our backlog represents the value of uncompleted customer orders 
while we cannot be certain that reported backlog will be indicative of future results  our ability to accurately value our backlog can be adversely affected by numerous factors  including economic uncertainty 
while we attempt to mitigate the financial consequences of order delays and cancellations through contractual provisions and other means  if we were to experience a significant increase in order delays or cancellations that can result from the aforementioned economic conditions  it could impede or delay our ability to realize anticipated revenues on our backlog 
such a loss of anticipated revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to deliver our sizeable backlog on time  which could affect our revenues  future sales and profitability and our relationships with customers 
at december   backlog was billion 
in  our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for backlog is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  sufficient manufacturing plant capacity  adequate supply channel access to the raw materials and other inventory required for production  an adequately trained and capable workforce  project engineering expertise for certain large projects and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources 
many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times and contain penalty clauses related to on time delivery 
failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to financial penalties  may result in damage to existing customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we sell our products in highly competitive markets  which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 
the markets for our products and services are fragmented and highly competitive 
we compete against large and well established national and global companies  as well as regional and local companies  low cost replicators of spare parts and in house maintenance departments of our end user customers 
we compete based on price  technical expertise  timeliness of delivery  contractual terms  previous installation history and reputation for quality and reliability 
while competitive environments in slow growth industries and for original equipment orders are inherently more influenced by pricing  domestic and global economic conditions during and current economic forecasts suggest that the competitive influence of pricing has broadened 
additionally  some of our customers have been attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventory 
to remain competitive  we must invest in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
no assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
if we are not able to execute and realize the expected financial benefits from our strategic realignment and other cost saving initiatives  our business could be adversely affected 
at the outset of  we announced a strategic realignment initiative intended to reduce and optimize certain non strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure 
this initiative was expanded in the latter half of to include additional realignment activities in the remainder of and continuing to a lesser extent into  and involves structural changes in our global manufacturing footprint through additional migration to low cost regions  additional consolidation of product manufacturing and further sg a reductions 
we also announced as part of our larger realignment strategy and to better serve our customers that  effective january   we consolidated the flowserve pump division and flow solutions division into the new flow solutions group 

table of contents while we anticipate significant financial benefits from our strategic realignment  anticipated cost savings are by their nature estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily inexact 
further  our integration of the flowserve pump and flow solutions divisions and our additional realignment activities will place substantial demands on our management  which could divert attention from other business priorities 
if we are unable to integrate our businesses successfully or execute these realignment activities effectively  then we may fail to realize the anticipated synergies  customer service improvements and cost savings of this strategic initiative 
this failure could  in turn  materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
economic  political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our operations is conducted and located outside the us we have manufacturing  sales or service facilities in more than countries and sell to customers in over countries  in addition to the us moreover  we primarily outsource certain of our manufacturing and engineering functions to  and source our raw materials and components from  china  eastern europe  india  latin america and mexico 
accordingly  our business and results of operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  including instability in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets and the middle east  trade protection measures  such as tariff increases  and import and export licensing and control requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or tax examinations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems  differing and  in some cases  more stringent labor regulations  partial or total expropriation  differing protection of intellectual property  inability to repatriate income or capital  and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies  which may be different than the customary business practices of local cultures 
for example  political unrest or work stoppages could negatively impact the demand for our products from customers in affected countries and other customers  such as us oil refineries  that could be affected by the resulting disruption in the supply of crude oil 
similarly  military conflicts in the middle east could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services 
we are also investigating or have investigated certain allegations regarding foreign management engaging in unethical practices prohibited by our code of business conduct  which could have inappropriately benefited them at our expense 
in order to manage our day to day operations  we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices 
in addition  we are required to create compensation programs  employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries 
we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network 
our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
any of these factors could  however  materially adversely affect our international operations and  consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our international operations and foreign subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 
due to the international scope of our operations  the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes  without limitation  the us foreign corrupt practices act and regulations issued by the us customs and border protection  the us department of commerce s bureau of industry and security  the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control and various foreign governmental agencies  including applicable export controls  customs  currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations and various programs administered by the united nations  as applicable 
no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with  or be able to detect violations of  any such laws or regulations 
in addition  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
we are also subject to risks associated with certain of our foreign subsidiaries autonomously making sales and providing related services  under their own local authority  to customers in countries that have been designated by the us state department as state sponsors of terrorism  including iran  syria and sudan 
due to the growing political uncertainties associated with these countries  in  our foreign subsidiaries began a voluntary withdrawal  on a phased basis  from conducting new business in these countries 
the aggregate amount of all business done by our foreign subsidiaries for customers in iran  syria and sudan accounted for less than of our consolidated global revenue in while substantially all new business with these countries has been voluntarily phased out  our foreign subsidiaries may independently continue to honor certain existing contracts  commitments and warranty obligations in compliance with us and other applicable laws and regulations 
our international operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our revenue  and certain of our costs  assets and liabilities  are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the euro  british pound  mexican peso  argentina peso  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  russian ruble  indian rupee  singapore dollar  swedish krona and venezuelan bolivar 
certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure  such as the argentinean peso and the venezuelan bolivar  have undergone significant devaluation in the past  which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets  reduce the us dollar value of our local cash flow  generate local currency losses that may impact our ability to pay future dividends from our subsidiary to the parent company and potentially reduce the us dollar value of future local net income 
although we enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies  no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
noncompliance with us export control laws could materially adversely affect our business 
in march  we initiated a voluntary process to determine our compliance posture with respect to us export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations 
upon initial investigation  it appeared that some product transactions and technology transfers were not handled in full compliance with us export control laws and regulations 
as a result  in conjunction with outside counsel  we conducted a voluntary systematic process to further review  validate and voluntarily disclose export violations discovered as part of this review process 
we completed our comprehensive disclosures to the appropriate us government regulatory authorities at the end of  and we continue to work with those authorities to supplement and clarify specific aspects of those disclosures 
based on our review of the data collected  during the self disclosure period of october  through october   a number of process pumps  valves  mechanical seals and parts related thereto were exported  in limited circumstances  without required export or reexport licenses or without full compliance with all applicable rules and regulations to a number of different countries throughout the world  including certain us sanctioned countries 
the foregoing information is subject to revision as we further review this submittal with applicable us regulatory authorities 
any self reported violations of us export control laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal penalties  including fines and or other penalties 
we are currently engaged in discussions with us regulators about 
table of contents such penalties as part of our effort to resolve this matter  however  while we currently do not believe any such penalties will have a material adverse impact on our company  we are currently unable to definitively determine the full extent or nature or total amount of penalties to which we might be subject as a result of any such self reported violations of the us export control laws and regulations 
terrorist acts  conflicts and wars may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and may adversely affect the market for our common stock 
as a major multi national company with a large international footprint  we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers due to terrorist acts  conflicts and wars  wherever located around the world 
the potential for future attacks  the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other actual or potential conflicts or wars  including the israeli hamas conflict and ongoing military operations in the middle east at large  have created many economic and political uncertainties 
in addition  as a major multi national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the us  actions against or by the us may impact our business or employees 
although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events  they could result in a decrease in demand for our products  make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers  create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and pose risks to our employees  resulting in the need to impose travel restrictions  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are currently subject to a conditional securities class action litigation settlement  which if not finalized  could lead to continued litigation  the unfavorable outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a number of putative class action lawsuits were filed against us  certain of our former officers  our independent auditors and the lead underwriters of our most recent public stock offerings  alleging securities laws violations 
by orders dated november  and january   the trial court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification and also granted summary judgment in favor of us and all other defendants on all of the plaintiffs claims 
the plaintiffs appealed both rulings to the federal fifth circuit court of appeals  and on june   the fifth circuit issued an opinion vacating the trial court s denial of class certification  reversing in part and vacating in part the trial court s entry of summary judgment 
as a result  the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion and further consideration of certain issues  including whether the plaintiffs can demonstrate that the case should be certified as a class action 
following the issuance of the court of appeals opinion  we engaged in discussions among the parties in furtherance of an amicable resolution of the case  which resulted in a stipulation of settlement being executed and filed with the trial court 
the settlement is subject to various customary conditions  including preliminary approval by the trial court  notice to class members  class member opt out thresholds  a final hearing and final approval by the trial court 
these conditions may not occur  and we must therefore be prepared to continue the case if they do not occur 
if the litigation proceeds  we continue to strongly believe that we have valid defenses to the claims asserted  and we will continue to vigorously defend this case 
in addition to the significant expense and burden we could then incur in further defending this litigation and any damages that we could suffer  our management s attention and resources could be further diverted from ordinary business operations in order to address these claims 
if the final resolution of this litigation is then unfavorable to us and our existing insurance coverage is either unavailable or inadequate to resolve the matter  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations and properties are subject to regulation under environmental laws  which can impose substantial sanctions for violations 
we must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all countries in which we operate 

table of contents we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations 
most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes  and some may require clean up of historical contamination 
we are currently conducting investigation and or remediation activities at a number of locations where we have known environmental concerns 
in addition  we have been identified as one of many prps at three superfund sites 
the projected cost of remediation at these sites  as well as our alleged fair share allocation  while not anticipated to be material  has been reserved 
however  until all studies have been completed and the parties have either negotiated an amicable resolution or the matter has been judicially resolved  some degree of uncertainty remains 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing requirements  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities 
moreover  environmental and sustainability initiatives  practices  rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non governmental bodies  which can cause rapid change in operational practices  standards and expectations and  in turn  increase our compliance costs 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are party to asbestos containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are a defendant in a large number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products formerly manufactured and or distributed by us 
such products were used as components of process equipment  and we do not believe that there was any significant emission of asbestos containing fibers during the use of this equipment 
although we are defending these allegations vigorously and believe that a high percentage of these lawsuits are covered by insurance or indemnities from other companies  there can be no assurance that we will prevail or that payments made by insurance or such other companies would be adequate 
unfavorable rulings  judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  of which approximately  were located in the us approximately of our us employees are represented by unions 
we also have unionized employees or employee work councils in argentina  australia  austria  belgium  brazil  canada  finland  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  the netherlands  spain  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
no unionized facility produces more than of our revenues 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are strong and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages recently  no assurances can be made that we will not in the future experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions  works councils  other groups representing employees or our employees generally  or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 
inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our competitive position 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee  however  that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement on our rights or misappropriation of our technology 
for example  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the foreign countries in which we operate 
in addition  while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know how related to the design  manufacture or operation of our products 
if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  any proceedings could be burdensome and costly  and we may not prevail 
further  adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual 
table of contents property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices  our operating margins and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we purchase substantially all electric power and other raw materials we use in the manufacturing of our products from outside sources 
the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control 
in recent years  the prices for energy  metal alloys  nickel and certain other of our raw materials have been volatile 
while we strive to offset our increased costs through supply chain management  contractual provisions and our cip initiative  where gains are achieved in operational efficiencies  our operating margins and results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved 
significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions changes may have a material effect on the valuation of our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans  the funded status of these plans and our pension expense 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans that are required to be funded in the us  india  japan  mexico  the netherlands and the united kingdom  and defined benefit plans that are not required to be funded in austria  france  germany and sweden 
our pension liability is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and  in the case of the plans that are required to be funded  the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a change in the discount rate can result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations  affecting the reported status of our pension plans and our pension expense 
significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets 
changes in the expected return on plan assets assumption can result in significant changes in our pension expense and future funding requirements 
we continually review our funding policy related to our us pension plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the performance of global financial markets in  and to a lesser extent in  has reduced the value of investments held in trust to support pension plans 
additionally  us regulations are continually increasing the minimum level of funding for u 
s pension plans 
the combined impact of these changes required significant contributions to our pension plans in  which will continue  albeit to a lesser extent  in contributions to our pension plans reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes 
we may incur material costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of one of our products results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected 
while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims  we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future  and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims 
in addition  product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time  regardless of the ultimate outcome 
an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products  claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company 
warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance  and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed 

table of contents the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future could affect our operating results 
we currently have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carry forwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on our assessment of our deferred tax assets  we determined  based on projected future income and certain available tax planning strategies  that approximately million of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future  and no valuation allowance is currently required for this portion of our deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized  we will be required to record an additional valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and our operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made 
our outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness limit our operating and financial flexibility 
we are required to make scheduled repayments and  under certain events of default  mandatory repayments on our outstanding indebtedness  which may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  such as dividend payments and share repurchases  and could generally limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
in addition  the agreements governing our bank credit facilities impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us and somewhat limit management s discretion in operating our businesses 
these agreements limit or restrict our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt  change fiscal year  pay dividends and make other distributions  prepay subordinated debt  make investments and other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
our bank credit facilities also contain covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders certificates of compliance with leverage and interest coverage financial covenants and our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to continue to expand our market presence through acquisitions  and any future acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs 
since  we have expanded through a number of acquisitions  and we may pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses in the future 
our ability to implement this growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates  covenants in our credit agreement and other debt agreements and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
in addition  acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt financing  resulting in higher leverage and an increase in interest expense  and could result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities 
should we acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may create operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the more common challenges associated with acquisitions that we may experience include loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company  conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls  including accounting systems and controls  with our operations  which could cause deficiencies related to our internal control over financial reporting  coordinating operations that are increased in scope  geographic diversity and complexity  retooling and reprogramming of equipment  
table of contents hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day operations 
further  no guarantees can be made that we would realize the cost savings  synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition  or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect 
if we are not able to timely address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses  or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be adversely affected

the worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue  where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes 
over the past several years  we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings  as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods 
the aftermarket business  which is served by more than of our qrcs located around the globe  provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts  service solutions  product life cycle solutions and other value added services  and is generally a higher margin business and a key component of our profitable growth 
through december   our operations were conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a flowserve pump division fpd engineered and industrial pumps  pump systems  submersible motors and related services  flow control division fcd engineered and industrial valves  control valves  actuators  controls and related services  and flow solutions division fsd mechanical seals  auxiliary systems and parts and related services 
our product portfolio is built on more than well respected brand names such as worthington  idp  valtek  limitorque and durametallic  which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry 
the products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than  companies  including some of the world s leading engineering and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users 
we continue to build on our geographic breadth through our qrc network with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business 
along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell  install and service our equipment in remote regions  it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations 
we continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
significant efforts are underway to improve the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while managing warranty costs as a percentage of 
table of contents sales across our global operations  through the assistance of a focused cip initiative 
the goal of the cip initiative  which includes lean manufacturing  six sigma business management strategy and value engineering  is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on time delivery  reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
we experienced reduced demand for original equipment in as compared with this was a result of the impact from the global financial crisis and economic recession 
many of our oil and gas customers postponed major capital decisions from their original initiation dates in order to reevaluate the viability of the project  take advantage of the cost reduction in commodities  such as steel  or to better align the start up of operations with revised demand growth forecasts 
in the chemical market  capital spending was reduced due to the adverse effects this industry experienced from the significant drop in consumer demand and the gross domestic product gdp decline of many economic regions 
both the power generation and water management markets showed resiliency in their capital spending due to government stimulus investments  management of existing operations and the necessity to build infrastructure for developing markets 
capital spending directed at improving and optimizing existing operations provided growth opportunities across all of these industries in  and the developing regions of the world continued capital investments despite the challenging global economy 
in  we experienced stable conditions in our global aftermarket business 
the demand growth in past years provided us the opportunity to increase our installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket sales 
over the past several years  we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings  as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods 
in  we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture these aftermarket opportunities 
we believe that with our customer relationships  our global presence and our highly regarded technical capabilities  we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries  however  we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence  such as economic  political  currency and other risks 
our markets the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the outlook for section included in this md a 
our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water management  and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of new capital investment depends  in turn  on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas  power and water  as well as general economic conditions 
these drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior 
the levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment  planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process 
our customers include engineering contractors  original equipment manufacturers  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering contractors and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications  as are certain sales to distributors 
project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as book and ship  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
these orders are typically for more standardized  general purpose products  parts or services 
each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from a large installed base of our pumps  valves and seals  which require maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
we use our manufacturing platform and global 
table of contents network of qrcs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services  such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response  we believe customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  the aftermarket for standard products is competitive  as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products 
as proximity of service centers  timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services  we continue to expand our global qrc network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business 
oil and gas the oil and gas industry  which represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively  experienced a measurable decline in new orders placed in many of our clients postponed major projects due to the global financial crisis and the recession that followed 
the delay of these projects was driven by the desire to take advantage of lower commodity costs  such as steel  the need to reevaluate the return on investment for a project or simply to better align the planned increased capacity with the revised timing of forecasted demand growth 
global demand forecasts were revised downward in the later part of and through the first half of mid year forecasts turned more positive with recovery being supported by economic investment in developing regions such as china  india and the middle east 
these regions  along with latin america  africa and other parts of asia  continue to plan for investments to grow their operating capacity  driven by the intent to become self sufficient or to move into the more profitable products derived from refined oil 
the natural gas market experienced some reduction in spending on the upstream production side of the industry 
this slowdown was influenced primarily by a drop in overall demand 
investments did continue in the liquefied natural gas expansion  as the need to prepare new gas field production for shipment to the consumer markets supported the need to complete the projects 
the outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies 
we believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations 
a projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending  which could decrease demand for our products and services 
however  we believe the long term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply  projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long term demand growth 
chemical the chemical industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
this industry experienced adverse effects from the global financial crisis and recession  as consumer spending fell significantly and the gdp of many countries experienced declines for the first time in several years 
many of the major chemical companies were faced with restructuring their operations to align with current market conditions 
in  the industry experienced the closure or shut in of a large number of facilities around the globe  particularly in the mature markets 
in developing regions  investments continued at a moderated pace compared to previous years 
new plant investments are forecasted for developing regions as they build out capacity to meet their indigenous demand growth 
companies in the industry have generally increased their forecasts for maintenance and upgrades of continuing operations to ensure global competitiveness 
the outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions 
as consumer spending and industrial manufacturing gain momentum  the chemical industry should recover as well 
a stabilizing of the price of oil feedstock has the opportunity to promote investment  as companies can more effectively project potential financial return 
we believe the chemical industry in the near term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand 
we believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry 

table of contents power generation the power generation industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
this industry continued to see capital investment growth due to the increased demands for electricity in developing countries  such as china and india  and capacity increases in mature markets  including the united states us 
due to the need for increased power generating capacity and concerns about the environment  this industry did see a significant increase in the area of renewable power 
plans for nuclear power generation expanded measurably through the year  with countries such as china and india raising their planned capacity over the next decade 
expansion in solar power created opportunities in concentrated solar power applications where our products proved their ability to tolerate high temperatures and abrasive flow mediums 
the drive for a cleaner environment also increased investments in the development of carbon capture and storage methodologies where our products and services are applicable 
we believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable  however  a protracted economic recovery period could delay the demand for additional power  which may affect the timing of major capital project spending 
current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country 
it is important to note that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services 
we believe the long term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth  advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets 
we also believe that our long standing reputation in the power generation industry  our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods  our advancements in serving the renewables market and carbon capture methodologies along with our global service and support structure position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry 
water management the water management industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  particularly pumps 
we believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments even in the current economic environment 
industry forecasts do indicate some potential funding challenges for municipal and government projects due to reduced tax revenues  however  several government stimulus programs are targeted at the maintenance and development of fresh water resources 
these stimulus projects should generate demand and provide opportunities for pumps  valves  seals and actuation products 
the water management industry is facing a future supply demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization 
due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe  there continues to be an increased investment in desalination 
this investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next couple of decades 
we believe we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is already an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean region and the middle east 
we expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe  which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps  valves  actuation products and energy recovery devices 
general industries general industries comprises a variety of different businesses  including mining and ore processing  pharmaceuticals  pulp and paper  food and beverage and other smaller applications  none of which individually represented more than of total bookings in and general industries also include sales to distributors  whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve 
general industries represented  in the aggregate  approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
in  we saw a general decline in all of these businesses 
pulp and paper along with mining and ore processing are two areas that experienced measured declines in business activity and investment due to a drop in demand for their products 
this drop in demand was directly related to the significant decrease in the rate of general 
table of contents global economic growth 
other industries in this segment also experienced tougher market conditions when compared to previous years 
the outlook for this group of industries is dependent upon the rate of economic recovery 
we believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide business opportunities in these industries today and as the global economy recovers 
the reporting of trends by product type  customer type and business type is based upon analytical review of individual operational results and knowledge of their respective businesses  as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories 
these trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system 
our results of operations throughout this discussion of our results of operations  we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods
