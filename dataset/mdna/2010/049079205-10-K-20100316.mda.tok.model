for information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and long lived assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we are dependent on commnet and gt t for a majority of our revenues and profits 
for the year ended december   approximately of our consolidated revenue and substantially all of our consolidated operating income were generated by these two operating subsidiaries 
however  over the last several years  we have added substantially to the diversity of our business and reduced our historical dependence on our guyana operations for our financial results 
this reduction of gt t s contribution is due mainly to the acquisition and growth of our us wireless as well as the expansion of our us wireline business and the increase in our ownership interest in our bermuda operations and related acquisitions 
in addition to our pending alltel acquisition  we expect to continue this trend of diversification and are actively evaluating additional investment and acquisition opportunities that meet our return on investment and other acquisition criteria 
the pending acquisition of the alltel wireless assets  if completed  will further substantially reduce both commnet and gt t s portion of our consolidated revenue 
for information regarding the pending alltel acquisition see pending acquisitions alltel assets below 
during  commnet was the single largest contributor to our revenue and operating income 
the revenues and profits of this us wholesale wireless business are primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations we operate  the amount of voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates  and the rate we get paid from our carrier customers on that traffic 
the growth of these revenues has historically been driven mainly by the rate at which we expand the number of base stations we operate 
commnet competes with wireless service providers that operate networks in its markets and offer wholesale roaming services as well 
in addition  our carrier customers may also elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure including networks that we built out pursuant to certain roaming agreements in a market in which they operate  reducing or eliminating their need for our services in that market 
for example  the recent acquisition by verizon wireless of alltel corporation assets  and pending acquisition of alltel assets by at t  will result in our wholesale customers having 
table of contents their own infrastructure in certain markets where they are currently served by us 
this is expected to result in a significant loss of wireless wholesale revenue and operating income in future periods  which  if not offset by growth in other revenues generated or other sources could materially reduce our overall operating profits 
for more information regarding this segment  see the discussion of rural wireless in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the largest single component of our revenues and profits in the guyana market has been from international long distance business  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue during the year ended december  while the majority of this international long distance revenue is generated by calls originated by  or terminating with  our wireline and wireless customers  we are currently the exclusive provider of international voice and data in guyana and therefore generate revenue and profit from calls and data originating on our competitor s wireless network pursuant to an interconnection agreement 
digicel notified us that it terminated the agreement effective january for more information about digicel s termination of its interconnection agreement with us  please see recent proceedings under item legal proceedings 
the primary drivers of this long distance business are the population of guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to guyana and the rate foreign carriers pay gt t for handling incoming international calls and the number of people in guyana with a wireless handset or fixed telephone line 
however  in recent years  we believe various methods of illegal bypass and alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging  may have had a negative impact on both voice traffic and international long distance revenues 
beginning in  we believe there was a substantial increase in illegal bypass activities 
we have taken a number of measures to counter illegal bypass  including taking action against unlicensed operators in guyana  introducing special outbound call center rates  and we are examining automated technical solutions as well 
more recently  we also believe the current economic recession has reduced the volume of calls into and out of guyana and negatively impacted our revenues 
in addition to our planned capital expenditures to expand and upgrade our gt t network  we will be investing over the next six months approximately million to million in a new submarine fiber optic cable in guyana 
we have invested approximately million in this cable through december  the construction of this new international cable connecting guyana to trinidad will have the potential to provide for continued growth in the provision of high speed data and internet services into guyana  and give us a cost effective method of increased redundancy 
we believe this is particularly important in the current operating environment of a worldwide shift from voice driven applications to data driven applications and the growth in broadband demand 
we expect this cable to be operational mid year as previously disclosed in our public reports  the government of guyana has repeatedly stated its intention to introduce additional competition into guyana s telecommunications sector and held formal discussions with us in early regarding potential modifications or termination of gt t s exclusivity rights 
in october  gt t was informally notified that the government had retained the services of a us based law firm and a consultant to develop the legislative and regulatory reforms necessary to introduce telecommunication competition in guyana 
based on informal discussions with these parties  we currently expect draft legislation to be available in the first half of our exclusive license has a stated initial term that expires in december and is according to its terms  renewable for an additional year term at our sole option 
in november  we notified the government of guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional years 
at this time  atn and gt t do not know whether or how any draft legislation will address gt t s exclusive license  and if so  whether it would be pursuant to an agreement between gt t and the government 
other than entering into such an agreement on terms acceptable to us  we would seek to enforce gt t s rights by law and contract to be the exclusive provider of international voice and 
table of contents data services in guyana 
although we believe that we would be entitled to damages for any involuntary termination of that license  we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in any court or arbitration proceeding 
see business regulation regulation of our gt t subsidiary regulatory developments and risk factors our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk 
on may   at the annual general meeting of gt t  the representative of the government of guyana indicated to representatives of atn in attendance at the meeting that the government of guyana is interested in selling its interest in gt t 
in a letter dated may   the government of guyana formally offered to sell its interest in gt t to atn  which currently owns of gt t  and reserved the right to offer to sell such interest to other potential purchasers if atn decides not to purchase the government s stake 
the board of directors of atn considered the government s offer and  in a letter dated june   indicated that it was not prepared to make a definitive offer for that interest at this time 
the principal terms of our investment in gt t are set forth in the agreement between the government of the co operative republic of guyana and atn  dated june  the guyana agreement  which is included as exhibit to our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended march   as filed with the sec on may  the guyana agreement does not provide for any specific procedures in connection with the potential sale by the government of guyana of its interest in gt t and the government has not indicated a timeframe in which it would seek to complete any proposed sale 
on may   digicel filed a lawsuit in guyana challenging the legality of gt t s exclusive license under guyana s constitution 
digicel initially filed this lawsuit against the attorney general of guyana in the high court 
on may   gt t petitioned to intervene in the suit in order to oppose digicel s claims and that petition was granted on may  gt t filed its answer to the charge on june  and the case is pending 
we believe that any legal challenge to gt t s exclusive license granted in is without merit and we will vigorously defend against such a legal challenge 
pending acquisition alltel assets on june   the company entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with cellco partnership d b a verizon wireless verizon to acquire wireless assets previously acquired by verizon in its acquisition of alltel corporation alltel in certain  primarily rural  markets in georgia  north carolina  south carolina  illinois  ohio and idaho 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  verizon will cause certain licenses  network assets  tower and other leases and other assets and certain related liabilities to be contributed to a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary limited liability company  whose membership interests will be acquired by the company for a purchase price of approximately million the alltel acquisition 
verizon is required to divest these and other assets under consent decrees it entered into with the department of justice related to its purchase of alltel in january on may   at t announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with verizon to acquire the majority of the wireless assets required to be divested the at t acquisition 
atn has contracted to acquire from verizon the remainder of the assets required to be divested 
the parties have agreed to a variety of customary covenants and agreements  including with respect to confidentiality  cooperation including with respect to regulatory matters  the conduct of the business to be acquired in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and other restrictions on the operation of such business prior to the consummation of the alltel acquisition  public announcements and similar matters 
consummation of the alltel acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including  among others  i the receipt of the united states 
table of contents department of justice s approval of the alltel acquisition  ii the receipt of all required consents of the federal communications commission to the transfer  assignment or change in control of certain licenses pursuant to the alltel acquisition  iii the receipt of required consents from state public utility commissions  if any  and iv the absence of any injunction or final judgment prohibiting the consummation of the alltel acquisition 
consummation of the alltel acquisition is not subject to any financing condition 
in conjunction with the alltel acquisition  on january   the company amended and restated its existing credit facility to restate its existing million term loan term loan a and previously undrawn million revolving credit facility the revolver facility and provide for a new million term loan term loan b and together with the term loan a and revolver facility  the new credit facility 
upon the closing of the new credit facility  million was outstanding under the term loan a  an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the company s previous term loan under the company s prior credit facility 
no amount is currently outstanding under term loan b or the revolver facility 
the company plans to use cash on hand  the proceeds from term loan b and a portion of the proceeds available under the revolver facility towards the acquisition purchase price and related acquisition expenses and working capital adjustments 
we may use the proceeds of the term loan b solely in connection with the alltel acquisition 
borrowings under the term loan b are available to the company until the earlier of i completion of the alltel acquisition or ii march  the term loan b commitment expiration date 
we intend to request an extension to the term loan b commitment expiration date during the first quarter of for more information about the new credit facility  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
stimulus grants on august   commnet and ion filed applications for stimulus funds made available by the us government under provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of intended to stimulate the deployment of broadband infrastructure and services to rural  unserved and underserved areas 
in december  ion was named to receive a million federal stimulus grant to fund its ion upstate new york rural broadband initiative  which involves building ten new segments of fiber optic  middle mile broadband infrastructure  serving more than rural communities in upstate new york and parts of pennsylvania and vermont 
the new project will be undertaken through a public private partnership between ion and the development authority of the north country danc  a new york state public benefit corporation that owns and operates miles of fiber optic network and provides wholesale telecommunications transport services to voice  video  data and wireless service providers 
the million grant  awarded to ion by the national telecommunications and information administration of the us department of commerce ntia  under its broadband technology opportunities program  will be paid over the course of the project period as expenses are incurred  which is expected to be three years 
an additional million will be invested in the project by ion and danc 
the funding of the new ion project is not scheduled to occur until the second quarter of accordingly  the company did not recognize any of the granted funds during the results of ion are included in the company s integrated telephony domestic segment as reported in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
commnet and the navajo tribal utility authority submitted a combined request for million of stimulus funds to extend wireless fixed and mobile broadband service in portions of arizona  new mexico and utah  and are awaiting the decision of the us government

stockholders wireless revenue 
wireless revenue includes wholesale voice and data roaming revenue from our rural us operations  retail wireless revenues generated in guyana  and our retail wireless revenues generated by our island wireless segment in bermuda and the islands 
wireless revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
our rural us business increased its revenues by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents the increase in wireless revenue from our us wireless business was due primarily to continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations and the expansion of our data capabilities  which generated growth in minutes of use and increased data and international roaming revenue  as well as the december acquisition of the wireless network assets of cc communications  a telecommunications company based in fallon  nevada 
as of december  a total of base stations were deployed as compared to base stations as of december  our rural wireless revenue also increased as a result of growth in voice and data traffic measured in minutes and megabytes  respectively at existing sites and growth in data roaming revenue and international roaming revenue 
verizon s acquisition of alltel and the at t acquisition of certain assets of alltel  if approved by federal and regulatory authorities  will cause some loss of wireless revenue for us because certain network assets acquired by each of verizon and at t overlap geographically with our us network  of which they were our customers  in a substantial number of areas 
in addition  the at t acquisition  if approved by the regulatory authorities  would result in a significant additional loss in revenue when at t completes its previously announced gsm network build in those areas 
at t has publicly stated its expectation that it will complete such an overlay within a year from closing the purchase 
this loss in revenue could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and operating income if it is not offset or replaced by increased revenue in other areas of our us rural wireless business or from other sources including increased revenue in connection with our pending alltel acquisition  if completed 
while we expect to see a continued increase in wireless revenues from our rural us wireless business in geographical areas not impacted by verizon or at t s acquisition of alltel wireless networks  the pace of that increase in non alltel overlap markets may be slowed as compared to the growth in previous periods due to scheduled reductions in revenue rates 
wireless revenue in guyana increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended while gt t continues to respond to increased competition as well as a decrease in rates  wireless subscribers in guyana increased  from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately  subscribers as of december  while we have seen an increase in wireless subscribers  our competitor  digicel  a large regional wireless provider  could continue to take market share with aggressive marketing campaigns and spending  including handset subsidies 
in addition  the overall number of our wireless subscribers in guyana could be reduced as a result of recent regulations imposed on guyana telecommunications carriers  including our gt t subsidiary  to collect proof of address and photographic identification for all new and existing customers 
these requirements mandate that the telecommunications carriers must obtain this information or discontinue services to any undocumented subscribers 
these regulations  which recently became effective  are part of broader legislation enacted by the government requiring telecommunication carriers to implement procedures and network changes intended to assist law enforcement activities 
in the case of wireless customers  this data collection requirement must be complied with by december  gt t has communicated to the government the logistical difficulty of complying with its records requirement and the possibility for disruptions in service and the government has indicated that while it may not immediately enforce the disconnection  it will urge all carriers to use all possible avenues to collect this data 
our island wireless business increased wireless revenue by million  to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues is due to full year consolidation of revenues in following the increase in our equity position in  and consolidation of bdc  which occurred as of may  wireless subscribers in bermuda remained consistent at  for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents we expect wireless revenue from our island wireless business to grow as we complete the expansion and upgrading of our network in our early stage business in turks and caicos and launch new services in bermuda 
local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue is generated by our wireline operations in guyana  our integrated voice and data operations in new england and new york state  and our data services in the us virgin islands 
this revenue includes basic service fees  measured service revenue  and internet access fees  as well as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  long distance or toll charges excluding international long distance charges in guyana  maintenance and equipment sales 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is predominantly attributable to sovernet  which increased revenues by million  mainly as a result of the addition of ion  which sovernet acquired on august  sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services  however  its overall revenue increase is partially offset by the decline in its residential data business  particularly its dial up internet services 
local telephone and data revenue in guyana increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gt t s access lines in guyana grew from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of 
revenue from the growth in access lines has been partially offset by a decrease in usage that is likely due to wireless service alternatives 
data revenue at our us virgin islands subsidiary increased million  or  to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in future periods  we anticipate that local telephone and data revenue will increase modestly as a result of network expansion  subscriber and access line growth  and capacity sales in new york  new england and guyana 
while ion expects to expand its network and receive a portion of the million grant during  we do not expect the network buildout to significantly impact revenue during since the buildout will not be complete 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana and does not include international long distance revenue generated by our other operations 
inbound traffic  which made up of all international long distance traffic and of international long distance revenue for the year ended december   is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  we believe this decrease is a result of continued and considerable illegal bypass activities resulting in lost revenue opportunities  as well as an overall reduction in call volume into guyana attributable to the current difficult global economic environment 
international voice traffic may also be declining as a result of the growth of alternative and cheaper media for communications  such as e mail and text messaging 
that shift to alternatives may grow faster in the future as we expand our data offerings in the market 
although the other modes of communication may cause a decline in both voice traffic and in international long distance revenues in future periods  we may see a slight increase in traffic and revenues if we are effective in combating illegal bypass 
we have taken a number of measures to counter illegal bypass  but have had limited success to date 
these measures include taking action against unlicensed operators in guyana  introducing special outbound call center rates and we are examining automated technical solutions as well 
the outcome of negotiations with the government of guyana regarding the exclusivity terms of gt t s license is also likely to negatively impact this revenue in the future 
in january  we launched a promotion significantly lowering international calling rates to certain destinations 
we 
table of contents expect this to stimulate traffic volumes but expect it still may result in a further revenue decline given the size of the rate reduction 
this promotion will expire on march  but we have applied with the government of guyana for a three month extension 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands  which decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on may  the company terminated its digital television services to focus solely on providing wireless broadband data and dialup internet services 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay for voice and data transport circuits in particular  the circuits between our rural wireless sites and our switches  internet capacity and other access fees we pay to terminate our calls 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased traffic at commnet  the consolidation of a full year of operating results for bdc in and an increase in expenses at sovernet due to a full year of operating results of ion 
termination and access fees are expected to increase in future periods  but remain fairly consistent as compared to their related revenues  as our rural wireless and clec operations in vermont expand 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses include internet connectivity charges and digital television programming 
internet and programming expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december this decrease was a result of a decrease in expenses from the us virgin islands  as we terminated our digital television service on may  engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks  including the salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the expansion of our wireless networks in the united states and the consolidation of bdc s results for all of we expect that engineering and operations expenses will continue to increase as our networks expand and require additional support 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits we pay to sales personnel  customer service expenses  sales commissions and the costs associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the majority of this increase is the result of the consolidation of a full year of operating results of bdc for we expect that sales and marketing expenses will remain fairly consistent as a percentage of related revenues in the near future 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million is the result of our consolidation of a full year of operating results of bdc in the remaining increase is due to increased overhead to support our growth and internal costs associated with the pending acquisition of alltel assets 
while internal costs specific to the pending acquisition of alltel assets are expected to decrease after the acquisition is completed  we expect overall general and administrative expenses to increase in order to support our growth but remain consistent as compared to our consolidated revenues 
acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges include the external costs  such as legal and consulting  directly associated with acquisition related activities  which are expensed as incurred 
acquisition related charges do not include internal costs  such as employee salary and travel related expenses  which we incurred during in connection with the pending acquisition of the alltel assets 
for the year ended december  acquisition related charges were million  an increase from million for the year ended december  of the costs  million were associated with the pending acquisition of alltel assets 
we anticipate that our acquisition of the alltel assets will be completed during the first half of until then  we expect acquisition related charges will continue at the current pace 
after the acquisition of the alltel assets is completed  we expect that acquisition related expenses to continue to be incurred  however  at a much reduced level  as the company continues to explore additional acquisition opportunities that meet its investment objectives 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment and on our intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the addition of fixed assets from our network expansion in our rural us wireless business  the consolidation of a full year of operating results of bdc in  and the acquisitions of ion and islandcom  which occurred in the third quarter of we expect depreciation and amortization expenses to continue to increase as a result of a future network expansion 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding credit facilities 
interest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due to the increase in our term loan borrowings 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit during the years ended december  or on september   the company repaid the then outstanding million term loan with the proceeds from a new million variable rate term loan 
at the same time  the company s variable rate revolving line of credit facility expanded from million to million 
also during september  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  to effectively lock the company s interest rate on million of these facilities at  which is further detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement on january  the amended credit facility is expected to increase the company s interest expense in the future pending the company s completion of the acquisition of the alltel assets 

table of contents interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investments 
interest income decreased to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of a decrease in the interest rates and subsequent amount earned on our cash and investments 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ending december  income tax expense includes income taxes at the statutory us federal and state income tax rates as well as the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates 
since we operate in jurisdictions that have a wide range of statutory tax rates  our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of income generated in those jurisdictions as well as the receipt of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries 
the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate was a result of losses in our island wireless segment for which we receive no tax benefit 
net income attributable to non controlling interests 
net income attributable to non controlling interests consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a non controlling shareholder s interest in sovernet  other non controlling shareholders interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet  and non controlling shareholders equity interest in bdc as well as non controlling shareholders interests in consolidated subsidiaries of sovernet and bdc 
net income attributable to non controlling interests decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the allocation of non controlling shareholders share of losses in our two early stage businesses ion and islandcom following the adoption the fasb s authoritative guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements in net income attributable to atlantic tele network  inc stockholders 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  on a per share basis  net income increased from per basic and per diluted share to per basic and per diluted share for the years ended december  to  respectively 
segment results 
we have five material operating segments  which we manage and evaluate separately rural wireless  integrated telephony international  island wireless  integrated telephony domestic  and wireless data 
island wireless became an operating segment upon completion of bdc s share repurchase and the resulting increase in our equity interest in bdc  effective may  segment results are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

table of contents wireless revenue 
wireless revenue includes wholesale voice and data roaming revenue from our rural us operations and retail wireless revenues generated in guyana 
for  wireless revenue also includes retail wireless revenues generated by our island wireless segment 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
notwithstanding the sale of base stations during the fourth quarter of  our rural us business increased its revenues by million  or  to million for from million for the increase in revenue from our us wireless business was due primarily to growth in voice and data traffic at existing sites  as well as the continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations that generated additional minutes of use and increased data revenue 
also included in this increase was million of switching fees earned on the sold base stations 
as of december   a total of base stations were deployed as compared to base stations as of december  we put into service new base stations  acquired base stations  and decommissioned older tdma analog base stations 
the consolidation of our bdc operating results  which began as of may   contributed million of the increase in wireless revenue 
this increase in wireless revenue from our rural us operations and bdc was partially offset by a decline in wireless revenue in guyana 
digicel entered the guyana market in early with aggressive marketing campaigns and handset subsidies 
this decline in revenue in reflects the continued impact of that competition  a decrease in rates and the introduction of per second billing in march for all wireless calls 
this additional competition in guyana caused our wireless subscribers to decrease by  or  from  subscribers as of december  to  subscribers as of december   respectively 
we also believe there may have been a decline in the total wireless subscribers in the market as the level of handset subsidies and giveaways fell from these factors resulted in a million decrease in gt t s wireless revenue from million during to million during local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily attributable to growth in gt t s access lines in guyana from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of  increased interconnect fees  growth in broadband data customers in guyana and continued strong growth in wireless broadband customers in the us virgin islands 
sovernet increased revenues by million  due mainly to the addition of ion on august  sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services at a strong rate and improve profitability  however  its overall revenue increase is partially offset by the decline in its residential data business  particularly its dial up internet services 
international long distance revenue 
inbound traffic  which made up of all international long distance traffic and more than of international long distance revenue for the year ended december   is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue declined by million  or  from million for to million for this decline was partly a result of certain significant events during  such as the run up to guyana s hosting of cricket world cup matches and the rio group summit  which we believe increased traffic volumes during that period 
we are also subject to illegal bypass via internet calling  which we believe increased considerably from the second to the fourth quarter of other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands  which decreased to million for from million for on may  the company terminated its digital television services to focus solely on providing wireless broadband data and dial up internet services

table of contents capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the telecommunications industry  our financial performance  the state of the capital markets and our compliance with securities and exchange commission sec requirements for the offering of securities 
in june  the company s universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec expired by its own terms 
the company currently anticipates that it will file with the sec a new universal shelf registration in the first half of  subject to closing of the alltel acquisition and completion of the required audited financial statements in connection therewith 
if declared effective by the sec  such filing will register potential future offerings by the company  of the company s securities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the periods presented in the report 
critical accounting estimates we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular transaction  we apply the criteria established by the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria 
as a result of the cutoff times of our billing cycles  we are often required to estimate the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and historical evidence with each customer or carrier 
adjustments affecting revenue can and occasionally do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue  however historically these adjustments have not been material 
a small portion of our revenue is attributable to activation or reactivation fees  installation fees and equipment sales 
we evaluate these and  where the amounts charged for such services or the equipment does not represent a separate unit of accounting  these amounts are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period 
we apply judgment when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable  the credit quality of customer and  where necessary  other macro economic factors 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for impairments or disposals of long lived assets and the authoritative guidance for the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived 
table of contents assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain assets of choice communications became impaired  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge in its statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the impairment charge 
our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we assess the recoverability of the value of our fcc licenses using a market approach 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the related technology used is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as an adverse change in the subsidiary s operating market  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a license by license basis 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books as we do not believe that an adverse outcome is probable 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
gt t s functional currency is the us dollar because a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar  however the guyanese exchange rate has remained at approximately guyana dollars to us dollar since so we have not recorded any foreign exchange gains or losses since that date 
all of our other foreign subsidiaries operate in jurisdictions where the us dollar is the recognized currency 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited and relates primarily to our variable interest rate long term debt 
as of december   million of our long term debt has a fixed rate by way of an interest rate swap that effectively hedges our interest rate risk 
the remaining million of long term debt as of december   is subject to interest rate risk 
as a result of our hedging policy we believe our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is not material
