overview we believe we are the leading national distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products in the united states and canada 
we carry more than  high quality natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products  consisting of national brands  regional brands  private label and master distribution products  in six product categories grocery and general merchandise  produce  perishables and frozen foods  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition  bulk and food service products and personal care items 
we serve more than  customer locations primarily located across the united states and canada  the majority of which can be classified into one of the following categories independently owned natural products retailers  which include buying clubs  supernatural chains  which consist solely of whole foods market  conventional supermarkets  which include mass market chains  and other which includes foodservice and international 
our operations are comprised of three principal operating divisions 
these operating divisions are our wholesale division  which includes our broadline natural and organic distribution business  unfi specialty  which is our specialty distribution business  albert s  which is a leading distributor of organically grown produce and perishable items  and select nutrition  which distributes vitamins  minerals and supplements  our retail division  consisting of the natural retail group  which operates our natural products retail stores within the united states  and 
table of contents our manufacturing division  consisting of woodstock farms manufacturing  which specializes in the importation  roasting  packaging and distribution of nuts  dried fruit  seeds  trail mixes  granola  natural and organic snack items  and confections  and our blue marble brands product lines 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share through our high quality service and a broader product selection  including specialty products  and the acquisition of  or merger with  natural and specialty products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers  the construction of new distribution centers  and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
we have been the primary distributor to whole foods market  for more than years 
effective june   we amended our distribution agreement with whole foods market to extend the term of the agreement for an additional seven years 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we will continue to serve as the primary wholesale natural grocery distributor to whole foods market in its united states regions where we were serving as the primary distributor at the time of the amendment 
the amendment extended the expiration date of the agreement from september  to september  on july   we announced that we had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which we have agreed to acquire certain distribution and related assets of whole foods market distribution  inc previously used in their self distribution of non perishables in their rocky mountain and southwest regions  and have undertaken to become the primary distributor in these regions 
consummation of the transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions  and is expected to occur in late september in the case of the southwest region and early october in the case of the rocky mountain region 
following the closing of this transaction  we will serve as the primary distributor to whole foods market in all of its regions in the united states 
in  our relationship with whole foods market was expanded to cover the former wild oats markets stores retained by whole foods market following whole foods market s merger with wild oats markets 
we had served as the primary distributor of natural and organic foods and non food products to wild oats market prior to the merger 
whole foods market accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years ended july  and august   respectively 
on june   we acquired the sdg assets of sunopta through our wholly owned subsidiary  unfi canada for cash consideration of million 
with the acquisition  we became the largest distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods  including kosher foods  in canada 
this was a strategic acquisition as unfi canada provides us with an immediate platform for growth in the canadian market 
on november   we acquired dhi for total cash consideration of million  consisting of the million purchase price and million of related transaction fees  subject to certain adjustments set forth in the merger agreement 
unfi specialty operates distribution centers located in massachusetts and arkansas  with customers throughout the united states 
through unfi specialty s two distribution centers  which provide approximately million square feet of warehouse space  as well as our broadline distribution centers where we have integrated specialty products  we distribute specialty food items including ethnic  kosher  gourmet  organic and natural foods  health and beauty care items and other non food items 
we believe that the acquisition of dhi accomplished certain of our strategic objectives  including accelerating our expansion into a number of high growth business segments and establishing immediate market share in the fast growing specialty foods market 
due to our expansion into specialty foods  we gained new business with a number of conventional supermarkets during fiscal we believe that unfi specialty s customer base enhances our 
table of contents conventional supermarket business channel and that our complementary product lines continue to present opportunities for cross selling 
in order to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we seek to continually expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expand our national purchasing opportunities  offer a broader product selection  offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on time deliveries  centralize general and administrative functions to reduce expenses  consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions  increase our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrate administrative and accounting functions  and reduce the geographic overlap between regions 
our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities to achieve increasing operating efficiencies 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the opening and expansion of our facilities 
we have increased our distribution capacity to approximately million square feet 
we opened our sarasota  florida warehouse in the first quarter of fiscal in order to reduce the geographic area served by our atlanta  georgia facility 
our  square foot distribution center in ridgefield  washington commenced operations in december and serves as a regional distribution hub for customers in portland  oregon and other northwest markets 
our  square foot distribution center in moreno valley  california commenced operations in september and serves our customers in southern california  arizona  southern nevada  southern utah  and hawaii 
our newly leased   square foot distribution center in york  pennsylvania  commenced operations in january  and replaces our new oxford  pennsylvania facility serving customers in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland  ohio  virginia  and west virginia 
in april  we successfully relocated our unfi specialty distribution facility in east brunswick  new jersey to the york  pennsylvania distribution center  creating our first fully integrated facility offering a full assortment of natural  organic  and specialty foods 
finally  in july  we commenced operations at a new facility in lancaster  texas  which began shipping to customers throughout the southwestern united states  including texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana in late september our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural  organic and specialty products to retailers  adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts charged by us to customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us at our manufacturing subsidiary  woodstock farms manufacturing  for inbound transportation costs and depreciation for manufacturing equipment  offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  
table of contents insurance  administrative  share based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
in fiscal  other expense income includes a gain of million recorded by the company in the fourth quarter upon settlement of the forward contract entered into by the company to swap us dollars for canadian dollars in connection with the purchase of the sdg assets in connection with the purchase of the sdg assets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies are i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and august   respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and august   respectively 
insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for workers compensation and automobile liabilities totaled million and million as of july  and august   respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
based on future expected cash flows  we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are at or one level below the operating segment level 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first 
table of contents step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
if required  the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
approximately of our goodwill is within our wholesale reporting unit 
for the wholesale reporting unit  the fair value was more than in excess of its carrying value and none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing step one of the impairment test 
total goodwill as of july  and august  was million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired 
impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
as of our most recent annual impairment test  the fair value of each of our indefinite lived intangible assets was in excess of its carrying value 
our most significant indefinite lived intangible asset represents approximately of our total indefinite lived intangible assets and its fair value was approximately in excess of its carrying value 
one of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which represents approximately of our total indefinite lived intangible assets  had a fair value of less than in excess of its respective carrying value 
the projections used in the impairment assessments for this asset assume sales growth of approximately per year  gross margin improvements of approximately over the five year projection and operating expenses which represent a slight improvement over current levels as a percentage of sales 
total indefinite lived intangible assets as of july  and august  were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset s useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our finite lived intangibles are not recoverable during total finite lived intangible assets as of july  and august  were million and million  respectively 

table of contents the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  august  august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses impairment on assets held for sale total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense interest income other  net total other expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income total reflects rounding note our fiscal year included weeks of operations while our and fiscal years included weeks of operations 
fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended august  net sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  or million  to a record billion from billion for the year ended august  this increase was primarily due to organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions in our wholesale division of million 
our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and value added services  and the opening of new  and expansion of existing  distribution centers  which allow us to carry a broader selection of products 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of million in sales from our acquisition of unfi canada during the fourth quarter of fiscal our improvement in net sales also reflected year over year improvement in sales of our specialty products  which had been negatively affected by the difficult economic environment present throughout our fiscal year 
in addition  we believe that the integration of our specialty business in certain of our markets has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 

table of contents our net sales by customer type for the years ended july  and august  were as follows in millions customer type net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other total net sales to whole foods market for the year ended july  increased by approximately million or and accounted for approximately and of our total net sales for the years ended july  and august   respectively 
whole foods market is our only supernatural chain customer following its acquisition of wild oats markets in august we continue to sell to the henry s and sun harvest locations that were divested by whole foods market when it acquired wild oats markets  and these sales are classified in the conventional supermarket channel 
the increase in sales to whole foods market is primarily due to increases in same store sales 
net sales to conventional supermarkets for the year ended july  increased by approximately million  or from fiscal and represented approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in net sales to conventional supermarkets is primarily due to several large new customers that we began servicing during the year based on our consolidated market strategy of natural  organic and specialty from one supplier  as well as million of net sales to conventional supermarkets by unfi canada 
net sales to our independent retailer channel increased by million  or during the year ended july  compared to the year ended august  while net sales in this channel have increased  they have grown at a slower rate than net sales in our supernatural and conventional supermarket channels  and therefore represent a lower percentage of our total net sales 
other net sales  which include sales to foodservice and international  decreased by approximately million  or during the year ended july  and accounted for approximately of total net sales compared to of total net sales for the year ended august  during the second half of fiscal we began to see steady improvement in our net sales and a reduction in the volatility of net sales  as compared to what we experienced throughout our fiscal year 
as we continue to aggressively pursue new customers and as economic conditions continue to stabilize  we expect net sales for fiscal to improve over fiscal in both our organic line and our specialty line 
we believe that this projected sales growth will come from both sales to new customers and an increase in the number of products that we sell to existing customers 
we expect that most of this growth will occur in our lower gross margin supernatural and conventional supermarket channels  including the impact of becoming whole foods market s primary distributor in its southwest and rocky mountain regions 
although sales to these customers typically generate lower gross margins than sales to customers within our independent retailer channel  they also carry a lower average cost to serve than sales to our independent customers 
we believe that the integration of our specialty business in certain of our markets has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
we also believe that our further integration of the specialty business in our markets will continue to allow us to pursue a broader array of customers 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended august  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended july  and for the year ended august  the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the change in the mix of net sales by channel during compared to in addition  gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended august  was positively impacted by fuel surcharge revenues and sales of our branded product lines 
our gross profits are generally higher on net sales to independently owned retailers and lower on net sales in the conventional supermarket and the supernatural channels 
for the year ended july  approximately million of our total net sales growth was from increased net sales in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels  while net sales growth from the independent and other channels was approximately million 
as a result  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal were to the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels compared to approximately in fiscal this change in sales mix from to resulted in lower gross profits as a percentage of sales during we anticipate net sales growth in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels will continue to outpace growth in the independent and other channels 
we expect that our expansion with whole foods market  both as a result of organic growth and as a result of becoming their primary distributor in their rocky mountain and southwest regions  and our opportunities in the conventional supermarket channel will continue to generate lower gross profit percentages than our historical rates 
we will seek to fully offset these reductions in gross profit percentages by reducing our operating expenses as a percent of net sales primarily through improved efficiencies in our supply chain and improvements to our it infrastructure 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended august  the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended july  was primarily due to higher sales volume along with ramp up costs for on boarding of certain new customers 
our operating expenses in fiscal also include approximately million in operating expenses for unfi canada since the date of acquisition as well as approximately million in transaction expenses directly related to the acquisition of the sdg assets from sunopta 
in addition  operating expenses for the year ended july  include severance charges of million related to the departure of two former senior officers  expenses of million related to the closing of an underperforming retail location  an adjustment of million to workers compensation expense related to a prior year s acquisition  higher share based compensation expenses  increases to health insurance expense and million in labor and other start up expenses related to our new distribution facility in lancaster  texas which should become fully operational in fiscal these increases were partially offset by on going cost control measures and lower bad debt expenses in the current year of million compared to million for the prior year 
unallocated corporate expenses have increased million during the year ended july  compared to the year ended august   primarily due to the continued development of a national platform across many functional areas 
total operating expenses for fiscal include share based compensation expense of million  compared to million in fiscal share based compensation expense for the year ended july  includes approximately million in expense related to the vesting of a performance share based award granted to our chief executive officer in november of related to certain financial goals for the period ended july  see note stock option plans to our consolidated financial 
table of contents statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended july   from approximately for the year ended august  the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the growth in the supernatural and conventional supermarket channels which in general have lower operating expenses  as well as expense control programs across all of our divisions 
we were able to manage our fuel costs despite rising prices by locking in the price of a portion of our expected fuel usage  updating and revising existing routes to reduce miles traveled  reducing idle times and other similar measures 
our expansion into lancaster  texas  where our new leased facility commenced operations in july and began servicing customers in late september  will further reduce our fuel costs as a percentage of net sales as we will be able to further reduce the number of miles traveled to serve our customers in texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana who were primarily served from our facility in denver  colorado 
we also expect that we will be able to continue to reduce our operating expenses as we continue the roll out of our supply chain initiatives including a national warehouse management and procurement system which was launched in the new lancaster  texas facility and is expected to be rolled out in all of our distribution centers by the end of during the year ended august   we incurred million in labor  lease termination  and start up expenses related to our then new distribution facilities in moreno valley  california and york  pennsylvania and the closing of our east brunswick  new jersey facility 
operating income operating income increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended august  as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended august  the increase in operating income is attributable to the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during compared to  offset by the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales over the same period 
other expense income other expense income decreased million to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended august  interest expense for the year ended july  decreased to million from million in the year ended august  the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average debt levels during the year as we managed our inventory balances  as well as the decrease in interest rates in compared to while average debt levels were lower in fiscal when compared to fiscal  our debt level increased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we financed our purchase of the sdg assets from sunopta with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with the expected purchase of the sdg assets  we entered into a forward contract to swap us dollars for canadian dollars 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended july   we recognized a gain of million  which is recorded in other income  upon settlement of the contract 
interest income for the year ended july  decreased to million from million in the year ended august  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and august   respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year ended july  is primarily due to tax credits associated with the installation of hydrogen powered lift trucks in our sarasota  florida facility 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended august  was primarily due to increases in state taxes 
our effective income tax rate in both fiscal years was 
table of contents also affected by share based compensation for incentive stock options and the timing of disqualifying dispositions of certain share based compensation awards 
certain incentive stock option expenses are not deductible for tax purposes unless a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option and within two years of original grant 
we receive a tax benefit in the period that the disqualifying disposition occurs 
our effective income tax rate will continue to be effected by the tax impact related to incentive stock options and the timing of tax benefits related to disqualifying dispositions 
in fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to 
net income reflecting the factors described in more detail above  net income increased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended august  fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to a record billion for the year ended august   from billion for the year ended august   which included an extra week 
this increase was primarily due to organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions in our wholesale distribution division of million 
our organic growth is due to the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and added value services  and the opening of new  and expansion of existing  distribution centers  which allow us to carry a broader selection of products 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of product sales from the three branded product lines we acquired during fiscal we acquired dhi on november   and therefore our results for the year ended august  include amounts attributable to this business for only approximately nine months 
our net sales by customer type for the years ended august  and august  were as follows in millions customer type net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other total whole foods market accounted for approximately and of our net sales for the years ended august  and august   respectively 
whole foods market is our only supernatural chain following its acquisition of wild oats markets in august we continue to sell to the henry s and sun harvest locations that were divested by whole foods market when it acquired wild oats markets  and these sales are classified in the conventional supermarket channel 
net sales to conventional supermarkets for the year ended august  decreased by approximately million  or from fiscal and represented approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in sales to the conventional supermarket channel is the result of customer losses within unfi specialty that were in process before our acquisition of dhi 

table of contents net sales to our independent retailer channel increased by million  or during the year ended august  compared to the year ended august  while net sales in this channel have increased  they have grown at a slower rate than net sales in our supernatural and conventional supermarket channels

we continue to expect unfi specialty s full service supermarket model to generate a higher gross margin over the long term in our core distribution business  however  we also expect to incur higher operating expenses in providing those services 
under this model  we provide services typically performed by supermarket employees to our customers  such as stocking shelves  placing sales orders and rotating out damaged and expired products 
we expect this benefit will be offset in part by other conventional supermarket and supernatural business which does not require this full service model  and therefore provides a lower gross margin percentage 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended august  the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended august  was primarily due to increases of million in information technology expenses  a million increase in health insurance expenses  a million increase in fixed asset depreciation and a million increase in amortization expense related to certain of our intangibles resulting from the purchase of dhi  partially offset by expense control programs across all of the company s divisions 
we were able to partially offset the effect of rising fuel prices by increasing delivery sizes  improving route design and by opening new facilities which reduce the total distance traveled to customers

interest income for the year ended august  decreased to million from million in the year ended august  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended august  and august   respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended august  was primarily due to increases in state taxes 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended august  was lower than our historical effective rate primarily due to tax credits associated with the solar panel installation projects at our rocklin  california and dayville  connecticut distribution facilities 
this decrease was offset by an increase in our effective income tax rate due to the acquisition of dhi

in addition  from time to time  we may issue equity and debt securities to finance our operations and acquisitions 
we feel that our cash on hand and available credit through our current revolving credit facility as discussed below is sufficient for our operations and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we expect to generate an average of million to million in cash flow from operations per year for the and fiscal years 
we intend to continue to utilize this cash generated from operations to pay down our debt levels  and fund working capital and capital

our borrowing base is determined as the lesser of million or the fixed percentages of our previous fiscal month end eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
as of july   our borrowing base  which was calculated based on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million 
as of july   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  million in letter of credit commitments and million in reserves which generally reduces our available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
when our borrowing base as calculated above is equal to million  reserves do not reduce available borrowing capacity 
our resulting remaining availability was million as of july  in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released from the lien under our revolving credit facility in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to that facility

future investments and acquisitions will be financed through either equity or long term debt negotiated at the time of the potential acquisition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july   a decrease of million from the million provided by operations for the year ended august  the primary reasons for the decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended july  were an increase in inventories of million due to our sales growth during the year and the inventory build up for our new facility in lancaster  texas

we may from time to time enter into commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with our anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
these commodity swap agreements hedge a portion of our expected fuel usage for the periods set forth in the agreements 
we monitor the commodity nymex heating oil used in our swap agreements to determine that the correlation between the commodity and diesel fuel is deemed to be highly effective
