item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook the macro economic conditions experienced during fiscal continued to present challenges that have hindered a recovery for the homebuilding industry 
consumers enjoyed record low interest rates for home mortgages and housing affordability along with federal and local government incentives that have attempted to support the housing industry 
these factors provided significant support to the industry during our second and third fiscal quarters as we experienced significant increases in new home orders 
however  this elevated volume of home purchases was not sustained upon the expiration of the government incentives 
continued high unemployment levels have caused high levels of uncertainty among employers and consumers concerning the health of the overall economy 
this uncertainty led to a decline in home orders during our fourth fiscal quarter that has continued into the first quarter of fiscal the current homebuilding environment is also challenged by increased numbers of foreclosed homes offered at substantially reduced prices 
these combined pressures in the marketplace have resulted in the continued use of sales incentives and price reductions by us and many of our competitors in an effort to generate sales and reduce inventory levels 
as a result  we continued to experience inventory valuation adjustments throughout fiscal despite these challenges  we were able to produce improvements in new home orders  home closings  gross margins and profitability in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  we continued to improve our capitalization while maintaining our three primary goals generate and maintain liquidity  reduce debt and increase shareholder net worth 
we raised million of common equity capital  million of equity linked capital mandatory convertible subordinated notes and tangible equity units and million senior notes while repaying million of our senior notes 
in fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit from total operations of million primarily resulting from the worker  homeownership and business act of which allowed us to carry back a portion of our fiscal federal tax loss 
this carry back claim allowed us to claim a refund of taxes paid in prior years and to monetize a deferred tax asset that had previously had a valuation allowance recorded against it 
the total amount of income tax refunds we received in fiscal was million 
throughout the homebuilding recession we have remained disciplined in our approach to the business 
we have continued to reduce direct construction costs  overhead expenses and controlled our land acquisition and development spending 
we remain committed to controlling our supply of unsold homes under construction and ensuring that our inventory supply aligns with our current demand expectations 
this approach resulted in the closure of several divisional operations during the past several years and resulted in our decision to exit the jacksonville  florida and albuquerque  new mexico markets during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect to continue this disciplined approach to managing our business during these uncertain times as we strive toward returning to profitability 
we will continue to focus on maintaining a significant liquidity position as we selectively invest in the growth of the business 
we may also  from time to time  continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity or other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete any of these transactions in the future on favorable terms or at all 
while our visibility into the economic conditions for fiscal is limited at this time  we believe that we will continue to benefit from increases in housing starts and improvements in employment 
therefore  we believe the environment will improve  perhaps slowly  and we have taken and will continue to take steps necessary to position ourselves to participate in the housing recovery 
we operated beazer mortgage corporation bmc from through february to offer mortgage financing to the buyers of our homes 
bmc entered into various agreements with mortgage investors for the origination of mortgage loans 
underwriting decisions were not made by bmc but by the investors or third party service providers 
to date  we have received requests to repurchase fewer than mortgage loans from various investors 
while we have not been required to repurchase any mortgage loans  we have established an immaterial amount as a reserve for the repurchase of mortgage loans originated by bmc 
we cannot rule out the potential for additional mortgage loan repurchase claims in the future  although  at this time  we do not believe that the exposure related to any such additional claims would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operation 
as of september   no liability has been recorded for any such additional claims as such exposure is not both probable and reasonably estimable 
critical accounting policies some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
inventory valuation held for development our homebuilding inventories that are accounted for as held for development include land and home construction assets grouped together as communities 
homebuilding inventories held for development are stated at cost including direct construction costs  capitalized indirect costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes 
table of contents unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we assess these assets no less than quarterly for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc 
generally  upon the commencement of land development activities  it may take three to five years depending on  among other things  the size of the community and its sales pace to fully develop  sell  construct and close all the homes in a typical community 
however  the impact of the recent downturn in our business has significantly lengthened the estimated life of many communities 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated are expected to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
we conduct a review of the recoverability of our homebuilding inventories held for development at the community level as factors indicate that an impairment may exist 
events and circumstances that might indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  adverse trends in new orders  higher than anticipated cancellations  declining margins  which might result from the need to offer incentives to new homebuyers to drive sales or price reductions to respond to actions taken by our competitors  economic factors specific to the markets in which we operate  including fluctuations in employment levels  population growth  or levels of new and resale homes for sale in the marketplace and a decline in the availability of credit across all industries 
as a result  we evaluate  among other things  the following information for each community actual net contribution margin defined as homebuilding revenues less homebuilding costs and direct selling expenses for homes closed in the current fiscal quarter  fiscal year to date and prior two fiscal quarters 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
direct selling expenses include commissions  closing costs and amortization related to model home furnishings and improvements  projected net contribution margin for homes in backlog  actual and trending new orders and cancellation rates  actual and trending base home sales prices and sales incentives for home sales that occurred in the prior two fiscal quarters that remain in backlog at the end of the fiscal quarter and expected future homes sales prices and sales incentives and absorption over the expected remaining life of the community  a comparison of our community to our competition to include  among other things  an analysis of various product offerings including  the size and style of the homes currently offered for sale  community amenity levels  availability of lots in our community and our competition s  desirability and uniqueness of our community and other market factors  and other events that may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of a community that we have evaluated as requiring a test for impairment  significant quantitative and qualitative assumptions are made relative to the future home sales prices  sales incentives  direct and indirect costs of home construction and land development and the pace of new home orders 
in addition  these assumptions are dependent upon the specific market conditions and competitive factors for each specific community and may differ greatly between communities within the same market and communities in different markets 
our estimates are made using information available at the date of the recoverability test  however  as facts and circumstances may change in future reporting periods  our estimates of recoverability are subject to change 
for assets in communities for which the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the carrying value of that community is written down to its then estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
the carrying value of assets in communities that were previously impaired and continue to be classified as held for development is not written up for future estimates of increases in fair value in future reporting periods 
market deterioration that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges on previously impaired 
table of contents homebuilding assets in addition to homebuilding assets not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if the market continues to deteriorate 
the fair value of the homebuilding inventory held for development is estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying community assets 
the discount rate used may be different for each community 
the factors considered when determining an appropriate discount rate for a community include  among others community specific factors such as the number of lots in the community  the status of land development in the community  the competitive factors influencing the sales performance of the community and overall market factors such as employment levels  consumer confidence and the existing supply of new and used homes for sale 
the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow models are specific to each community tested for impairment 
historically  these assumptions did not include market improvements except in limited circumstances in the latter years of long lived communities 
our assumptions assume limited market improvements in some communities beginning in fiscal and continuing improvement in these communities in subsequent years 
we assumed the remaining communities would have market improvements beginning in fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   we used discount rates of to in our estimated discounted cash flow impairment calculations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairments of our inventory of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for land under development and homes under construction for our continuing operations 
impairments of inventory previously held for development related to our discontinued operations were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to projected home sales prices and absorption rates  the timing and amount of the estimated future cash flows and discount rates  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and absorption rates require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of inventory held for development that were evaluated for impairment based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management relative to future results 
because our projected cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ materially from our estimates and result in additional impairments 
asset valuation land held for future development for those communities for which construction and development activities are expected to occur in the future or have been idled land held for future development  all applicable interest and real estate taxes are expensed as incurred and the inventory is stated at cost unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the future enactment of a development plan or the occurrence of events and circumstances may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the potential development plans of each community in land held for future development if changes in facts and circumstances occur which would give rise to a more detailed analysis for a change in the status of a community to active status or held for development 
asset valuation land held for sale we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
the following criteria are used to determine if land is held for sale management has the authority and commits to a plan to sell the land  the land is available for immediate sale in its present condition  there is an active program to locate a buyer and the plan to sell the property has been initiated  the sale of the land is probable within one year  
table of contents the property is being actively marketed at a reasonable sale price relative to its current fair value  and it is unlikely that the plan to sell will be withdrawn or that significant changes to the plan will be made 
additionally  in certain circumstances  management will re evaluate the best use of an asset that is currently being accounted for as held for development 
in such instances  management will review  among other things  the current and projected competitive circumstances of the community  including the level of supply of new and used inventory  the level of sales absorptions by us and our competition  the level of sales incentives required and the number of owned lots remaining in the community 
based on this review  if the foregoing criteria have been met at the end of the applicable reporting period and we believe that the best use of the asset is the sale of all or a portion of the asset in its current condition  then all or portions of the community are accounted for as held for sale 
in determining the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  we considered factors including current sales prices for comparable assets in the area  recent market analysis studies  appraisals  any recent legitimate offers  and listing prices of similar properties 
if the estimated fair value less cost to sell of an asset is less than its current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
during fiscal  and  we recorded inventory impairments on land held for sale by our continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively 
land held for sale inventory impairments related to our discontinued operations totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about land sales prices require significant judgment because the current market is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of land held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results and may result in additional impairments if market conditions continue to deteriorate 
homebuilding revenues and costs revenue from the sale of a home is generally recognized when the closing has occurred and the risk of ownership is transferred to the buyer 
as appropriate  revenue for condominiums under construction is recognized based on the percentage of completion method in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate asc  when certain criteria are met 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
sales commissions are included in selling  general and administrative expense when the closing has occurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves we currently provide a limited warranty ranging from one to two years covering workmanship and materials per our defined performance quality standards 
in addition  we provide a limited warranty generally ranging from a minimum of five years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose covering only certain defined construction defects 
we also provide a defined structural warranty with single family homes and townhomes in certain states 
since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors whose contracts generally include an indemnity obligation and a requirement that certain minimum insurance requirements be met  including providing us with a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work  claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of our subcontractors 
warranty reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record reserves covering our anticipated warranty expense for each home closed 
management reviews the adequacy of warranty reserves each reporting period  based on historical experience and management s estimate of the costs to remediate the claims  and adjusts these provisions accordingly 
our review includes a quarterly analysis of the historical data 
table of contents and trends in warranty expense by operating segment 
an analysis by operating segment allows us to consider market specific factors such as our warranty experience  the number of home closings  the prices of homes  product mix and other data in estimating our warranty reserves 
in addition  our analysis also contemplates the existence of any non recurring or community specific warranty related matters that might not be contemplated in our historical data and trends 
as a result of our analyses  we adjust our estimated warranty liabilities 
based on historical results  we believe that our existing estimation process is accurate and do not anticipate the process to materially change in the future 
our estimation process for such accruals is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that our warranty reserves at september  are adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs or that future developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we periodically enter into joint ventures with unrelated developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
we have determined that our interest in these joint ventures should be accounted for under the equity method 
we recognize our share of profits and losses from the sale of lots to other buyers 
our share of profits from lots purchased by beazer homes from the joint ventures are deferred and treated as a reduction of the cost of the land purchased from the joint venture 
such profits are subsequently recognized at the time the home closes and title passes to the homebuyer 
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period 
a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary 
the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
our assumption of the joint venture s estimated fair value is dependent on market conditions 
inventory in the joint venture is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities 
if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity  our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities 
the operating results of the unconsolidated joint ventures are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry  which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates  credit availability  unemployment levels and consumer sentiment 
changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities 
because of these changes in economic conditions  actual results could differ materially from management s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future 
during fiscal  and  we wrote down our investment in certain of our joint ventures reflecting million  million and million  respectively  of impairments of inventory held within those ventures 
these charges are included in equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying statement of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in addition  for fiscal  and  respectively  there were million  million and million of joint venture impairments related to certain homebuilding operations in our discontinued operations and  as a result  have been included in loss from discontinued operations  net in the accompanying statement of operations 
while we believe that no additional impairment of our unconsolidated joint venture investments existed as of september   market deterioration or changes in estimated future cash flows that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges 
as of september   our remaining investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaled million 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our 
table of contents assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  the section limitation on our ability to carryforward pre ownership change net operating losses and recognized built in losses or deductions  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for the valuation of deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
during fiscal  we determined that it was not more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized and  therefore  we established a valuation allowance of million for substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
we have not changed our assessment regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax assets as of september  and consequently  we determined that a valuation allowance was still warranted 
as of september   our deferred tax valuation allowance was million 
management reassesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets each reporting period 
to the extent that our results of operations improve and deferred tax assets become realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced and result in a non cash tax benefit 
we experienced an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code as of january  section contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforward and certain built in losses or deductions recognized during the five year period after the ownership change 
therefore  our ability to utilize our pre ownership change net operating loss nol carryforwards and certain recognized built in losses or deductions is limited by section to an estimated maximum annual amount of approximately million million tax effected 
there can be no assurance that another ownership change  as defined in the tax law  will not occur 
if another ownership change occurs  a new annual limitation on the utilization of net operating losses would be determined as of that date 
seasonal and quarterly variability our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
however  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  we continued to experience challenging conditions in most of our markets which contributed to decreased revenues and closings as compared to prior periods including prior quarters  thereby reducing typical seasonal variations 
in addition  the expiration of the  first time homebuyer tax credit on june   appears to have incentivized certain homebuyers to purchase homes during the first half of fiscal this resulted in a change to our typical seasonal variations as we experienced increased closings in our third quarter as opposed to our fourth quarter of fiscal the following chart presents certain quarterly operating data for our continuing operations for our last twelve fiscal quarters

in addition  during fiscal  we exited or discontinued our title services operations and our new mexico and jacksonville  florida markets and have reclassified the operating results of these operations for all period presented to discontinued operations 
we have also reclassified the operating results of our raleigh market from the east to the southeast segment in alignment with the basis that is used by management for evaluating segment performance and resource allocations 
inventory impairments and abandonments 
the improvement in gross margin over the past two fiscal years was directly related to a reduction in non cash pre tax inventory impairments and option contract abandonments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the projected cash flows used to evaluate the fair value of inventory are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions including decreased sales prices  the change in sales prices and changes in absorption estimates 
the impairments 
table of contents recorded on our held for development inventory for the fiscal years ended september  and  primarily resulted from the continued decline in the homebuilding environment across our submarkets 
during fiscal  although certain markets showed improvement from the prior years  for certain communities we determined it was prudent to reduce sales prices or further increase sales incentives in response to factors including competitive market conditions 
in future periods  we may again determine that it is prudent to reduce sales prices  further increase sales incentives or reduce absorption rates which may lead to additional impairments  which could be material 
our impairments on land held for sale listed below are as a result of challenging market conditions and our review of recent comparable transactions since land held for sale is recorded at net realizable value  less estimated costs to sell 
in addition  over the past few years  we have determined the proper course of action with respect to a number of communities within each homebuilding segment was to abandon the remaining lots under option and to write off the deposits securing the option takedowns  as well as pre acquisition costs 
the abandonment charges below relate to our decision to abandon certain option contracts that no longer fit in our long term strategic plan and related to our prior year decision to exit certain markets 
the following tables set forth  by reportable homebuilding segment  the inventory impairments and lot option abandonment charges recorded for the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands fiscal year ended september  development projects and homes in process held for development west east southeast unallocated subtotal land held for sale west east southeast subtotal lot option abandonments west east southeast subtotal continuing operations

fiscal included approximately million of expense for obligations related to the government investigations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in sg a expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to continued cost reductions realized as a result of our comprehensive review of sg a costs and the absence of the previously mentioned million fiscal expense offset by increased selling expenses related to the increase in home closings 
the decrease in sg a expense between fiscal and presented is primarily related to cost reductions realized as a result of our comprehensive review and realignment of our overhead structure in light of our reduced volume expectations and lower sales commissions related to decreased revenues  and decreased investigation related costs and severance costs offset partially by approximately million of expense for obligations related to the government investigations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   we had reduced our overall number of employees by or as compared to september   or a cumulative reduction of since september  fiscal and sg a expense included million and million in severance costs related to employees who had been severed as of september of the respective year

as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses were in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs  in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs and in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs 
the change in sg a costs as a percentage of total revenue is primarily related to the aforementioned investigative and severance costs and the impact of fixed overhead expenses on reduced increased revenues  as applicable 
goodwill impairment charges 
the company experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization during first quarter of fiscal as of december   we considered current and expected future market conditions and recorded a pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal related to our reporting units in maryland  houston  texas and nashville  tennessee 
as a result of this impairment charge  we have no goodwill remaining as of september  or in fiscal  in light of continuing market weakness  significantly reduced new orders  additional pricing pressures and additional incentives provided to homebuyers  our reforecasting of expected future results of operations and increasing inventory charges  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our reporting units in arizona  new jersey  southern california and virginia 
the goodwill impairment charges were based on estimates of the fair value of the underlying assets of the reporting units 
joint venture impairment charges 
as a result of the further deterioration of economic conditions in certain of our markets and the settlement of guarantees under debt obligations of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we recorded impairments in certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements where further discussed 
if these adverse market conditions continue or worsen  we may have to take 
table of contents further impairments of our investments in these joint ventures that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal  we completed a number of financial transactions including the repurchase of an aggregate of million of our outstanding senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
we also completed an exchange of million of our outstanding junior unsecured notes 
these transactions resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of million  net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs related to these notes 
during the second half of fiscal  we voluntarily repurchased in open market transactions million principal amount of our senior notes 
the aggregate purchase price was million  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date  which resulted in a million pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt  net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs related to these notes 
during fiscal  we also negotiated a reduced payoff for one of our other secured notes payable totaling million and recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of million related to the repayment of this note 
discontinued operations 
we have classified the results of operations of our mortgage origination services  title services and our exit markets as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
all statement of operations information in the table above and the management discussion and analysis that follow exclude the results of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations were not segregated in the consolidated statements of cash flows or the consolidated balance sheets

fiscal versus new orders  net of cancellations  for fiscal increased slightly compared to fiscal in many of our markets driven by increased demand due to federal and state housing credits which expired in june and decreased cancellation rates 
the decrease in net new orders in our west segment was primarily due to continued challenging market conditions which were particularly pronounced in our california markets 
historically low interest rates  increased affordability and federal and state housing tax credits appear to have enticed more prospective buyers to purchase a new home  however  foreclosures are having a damaging impact on the market 
in most of our markets  appraisals continue to be negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put additional pricing pressures on all home sales and limit financing availability 
the decrease in our cancellation rates reflects the market improvement and relative price stabilization as compared to the prior years 
it also reflects the impact of historically low interest rates and increased affordability and the impact of federal and state housing tax credits that enticed certain prospective buyers to purchase a new home during fiscal the decrease in total units in backlog and the aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog for our continuing operations at september  compared to the prior year  related partially to the acceleration of closings into our third fiscal quarter driven by the federal and state housing credits which expired in june as the availability of mortgage loans further stabilizes  the inventory of new and used homes decreases  and consumer confidence in the economic recovery increases  backlog should increase  however  continued reduced levels of backlog will produce less revenue in the future which could also result in additional asset impairment charges and lower levels of liquidity 
fiscal versus new orders  net for fiscal decreased as compared to the same period fiscal driven by weaker market conditions  including the tightening of mortgage credit availability  an increase in home foreclosures and other economic factors that have impacted homebuyers 
for fiscal  we experienced cancellation rates of compared to for fiscal these cancellation rates in both fiscal and reflect the continued challenging market environment which includes the inability of many potential homebuyers to sell their existing homes and obtain affordable financing 
in addition  on july   we completed the sale of two large condominium projects in virginia  which resulted in the cancellation of orders for fiscal  and the significant increase in the cancellation rate for our east segment 
excluding these transactions  our cancellation rates in the east segment and total continuing operations were and  respectively  for fiscal the decrease in cancellation rates across all markets reflects competitive pricing and a trend in the current environment that buyers are only willing to contract on a new home once their current home sells 
the aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog for our continuing operations at september  decreased from the prior year  related to a decrease in the number of homes in backlog 
the decrease in the number of homes in backlog across our west and southeast markets is driven primarily by the aforementioned market weakness and lower new orders 

table of contents backlog declined in many of our homebuilding markets from fiscal to due primarily to lower new orders caused by a competitive environment  increased foreclosures  the reduction in the availability of mortgage credit for our potential homebuyers and our decision to sell certain large projects 
foreclosures had by far the most damaging impact on the market during this period 
particularly in our southeast and nevada markets  appraisals were negatively impacted by foreclosure comparables which put additional pricing pressure on all home sales and limit financing availability 
homebuilding revenues and average selling price 
the table below summarizes homebuilding revenues  the average selling prices of our homes and closings by reportable segment in thousands homebuilding revenues average selling price v v v v west east southeast total closings v v west east southeast total fiscal versus homebuilding revenues increased slightly for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the comparable period of the prior year due to an increase in closings 
this year over year increase in closings was offset partially by a decrease in average selling prices asp 
the reduction in asp was primarily attributable to a substantial geographic shift in closings to those markets with the lowest asp and a higher concentration of entry level homebuyers 
in addition  foreclosures continue to pose problems in many of our markets manifesting in lower appraisals which put additional pricing pressure on all homes for sale 
as a result  we reduced sales prices in many of our markets during fiscal in order to respond to these market conditions 
historically low interest rates  increased affordability and federal and state housing tax credits incented more prospective buyers to purchase a new home and contributed to the significant increase in our closings for the fiscal year ended september  homebuilding revenues in our west segment decreased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the same period of fiscal driven by a decrease in homes closed and a decrease in asp 
the decrease in asp in our west segment for fiscal resulted primarily from a significant increase in the sale of entry level homes to first time homebuyers in all of our markets  a reduction in the amount of options and upgrades ordered along with select price declines in markets where conditions  such as a high levels of foreclosures and unemployment necessitated slightly lower home prices

our southeast segment continued to be challenged by excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets and the high number of foreclosures  driving decreases in asp of for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the homes closed during the fiscal year in many of our markets were more heavily weighted toward the entry level buyer than in the prior year 
fiscal versus homebuilding revenues decreased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal due to decreased closings in the majority of our markets  related to reduced demand  excess capacity in both new and resale

in addition  credit tightening in the mortgage markets  increased unemployment and a decline in consumer confidence in the majority of our markets further compounded the market pressures during the fiscal year specifically  homebuilding revenues in the west segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to reduced asp and reduced demand in the majority of the markets in this segment resulting from deteriorating market conditions and excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets 
in addition  credit tightening in the mortgage markets and a decline in consumer confidence in all of our markets further compounded the market deterioration in our nevada  california  texas and arizona markets in our west segment in fiscal for the fiscal year ended september   our east segment homebuilding revenues decreased by driven by a decline in closings and a decline in average sales prices which was particularly pronounced in our maryland  new jersey  tennessee and virginia markets 
these declines reflect the impact of excess capacity in the resale markets  the impact of credit tightening in the mortgage markets  competitive pricing pressures and a decline in consumer confidence 
our southeast segment continued to be challenged by significant declines in demand and excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets and high foreclosures  especially in our georgia and florida markets  driving decreases in homebuilding revenues of for fiscal as compared to fiscal home closings in the southeast segment decreased by from the prior year due to deteriorating market conditions and competitive pressures

homebuilding gross profit loss 
homebuilding gross profit loss is defined as homebuilding revenues less home cost of sales which includes land and land development costs  home construction costs  capitalized interest  indirect costs of construction  estimated warranty costs  closing costs and inventory impairment and lot option abandonment charges 
corporate and unallocated costs include the amortization of capitalized interest and indirect construction costs 
the following table sets forth our homebuilding gross profit loss and gross margin by reportable segment and total homebuilding gross profit loss and gross margin  and such amounts excluding inventory impairments and abandonments for the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands 
total homebuilding gross profit loss and gross margin excluding inventory impairments and abandonments are not gaap financial measures 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to homebuilding gross profit loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance 
the magnitude and volatility of non cash inventory impairment and abandonment charges for the company  and for other home builders  have been significant in recent periods and  as such  have made financial analysis of our industry more difficult 
homebuilding metrics excluding these charges  and other similar presentations by analysts and other companies  is frequently used to assist investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of home building activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies respective level of impairments 
management believes these non gaap measures enable holders of our securities to better understand the cash implications of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt obligations as they currently exist and as additional indebtedness is incurred in the future 
these measures are also useful internally  helping management compare operating results and as a measure of the level of cash which may be available for discretionary spending

our segments realized a nominal increase in gross margins excluding impairments as prices have begun to stabilize in certain of our markets and we benefitted from cost reductions 
a few of our markets experienced a decrease in gross margins excluding inventory impairments for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior year due to our decision to reduce prices in certain of our communities in order to compete with similar product for sale in the locale and to increase the frequency of new home orders 
fiscal versus the increase in homebuilding gross margins across all segments is primarily due to decreases in corporate costs and inventory impairments and lot option abandonment charges impairments and abandonments 
excluding impairments and abandonments  homebuilding gross margins increased slightly in our west segment due to continued focus on cost reduction initiatives  whereas they decreased in our east and southeast segments which continued to be challenged by the further deterioration of market conditions and an increased use of incentives 
the decrease in corporate and unallocated costs relates primarily to a reduction of approximately million in investigation related costs given the resolution of the previously disclosed investigations despite million of expense related to our obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements  a reduction of million in the amortization of capitalized interest costs due to a lower capitalizable inventory base and an increase in disallowed interest for capitalization which is recorded as other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and a reduction of million in expenses related to the impairment of capitalized interest and indirect costs in connection with the reduced level of inventory impairments in fiscal compared to fiscal land sales and other revenues

our fiscal land sales and other revenue and gross profit in our southeast segment also include net fees received for general contractor services we performed on behalf of a third party 
fiscal versus the decrease in land sales revenue and gross profit in our east segment from fiscal is primarily related to the sale of two condominium projects in virginia 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we enter into derivative agreements to manage interest costs and hedge against risks associated with fluctuating interest rates 
as of september   we were not a party to any such derivative agreements 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
liquidity and capital resources 
our sources of liquidity include  but are not limited to  cash from operations  proceeds from senior notes and other bank borrowings  the issuance of equity and equity linked securities and other external sources of funds 
our short term and long term liquidity depend primarily upon our level of net income  working capital management cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other liabilities and available credit facilities 
during the fiscal year ended september   we generated million in cash primarily from our operations 
our liquidity position consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents plus million of restricted cash as of september  we expect to maintain a significant liquidity position during fiscal  subject to changes in market conditions that would alter our expectations for land and land development expenditures or capital market conditions which could increase or decrease our cash balance on a quarterly basis 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million primarily due to reductions in inventory due to increased closings and timing of strategic land purchases 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september  our use of cash was primarily related to investments in our property  plant and equipment and joint ventures  million of which was used by one joint venture to repay outstanding debt  offset by a net reduction in our restricted cash of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we completed a million mandatory convertible subordinated notes offering  two common stock offerings totaling  total shares  a million senior unsecured debt offering and an offering of million tangible equity units 
the net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay our outstanding senior notes  senior notes and our convertible senior notes 
as a result of our and senior notes and convertible senior notes repayments  our next scheduled debt payment is not until november in addition  on january   we completed a partial exchange of million of our outstanding junior subordinated notes 
we recorded a net gain of approximately 
table of contents million during fiscal year ended september  primarily related to the exchange of our junior subordinated notes see note to the consolidated financial statements where further discussed 
during our fiscal  we received upgrades from s p in our corporate credit rating to b 
also during the fiscal year  moody s raised its corporate credit rating of the company to caa and fitch raised its corporate credit rating of the company to b 
these ratings and our current credit condition affect  among other things  our ability to access new capital 
negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt 
our credit ratings could be lowered or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in particular  a weakening of our financial condition  including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows  could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds  result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook  or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing 
we fulfill our short term cash requirements with cash generated from our operations 
there were no amounts outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility at september   however  million is currently used for letters of credit 
we have entered into a number of stand alone  cash secured letter of credit agreements with banks 
these facilities will continue to provide for future working capital and letter of credit needs collateralized by either cash or assets of the company at our option  based on certain conditions and covenant compliance 
as of september   we have secured our letters of credit under these facilities using cash collateral which is maintained in restricted accounts totaling million 
in addition  we have elected to pledge approximately million of inventory assets to our revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents at september  of million  cash generated from our operations and the availability of new debt and equity financing  if any  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
in fiscal  we raised million of common equity capital  million of equity linked capital mandatory convertible subordinated notes and tangible equity units and million senior notes while repaying million of our senior notes 
in addition  we restructured million of our subordinated indebtedness due in addition  we received federal income tax refunds totaling million 
we may also determine in the future that we need to issue additional new common or preferred equity 
any new issuance may take the form of public or private offerings for cash  equity issued to consummate acquisitions of assets or equity issued in exchange for a portion of our outstanding debt 
we may also from time to time seek to continue to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity or other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in addition  any material variance from our projected operating results or land investments  or investments in or acquisitions of businesses  or amounts paid to fulfill obligations with governmental entities  could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
any such equity transactions or debt financing may be on terms less favorable or at higher costs than our current financing sources  depending on future market conditions and other factors including any possible downgrades in our credit ratings or adverse commentaries issued by rating agencies in the future 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions in the future on favorable terms or at all 
stock repurchases and dividends paid the company did not repurchase any shares in the open market during fiscal  or any future stock repurchases as allowed by our debt covenants must be approved by the company s board of directors or its finance committee 
on november   our board of directors suspended payment of quarterly dividends 
the board concluded that suspending dividends  which will allow us to conserve approximately million of cash annually  was a prudent effort in light of the continued deterioration of the housing market 
in addition  the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on the payment of dividends 
at september   under the most restrictive covenants of each indenture  none of our retained earnings was available for cash dividends 
hence  there were no dividends paid in fiscal  or 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual commitments 
at september   we controlled  lots a year supply based on fiscal closings 
we owned  or  lots  and  lots   were under option contracts which generally require the payment of cash or the posting of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a certain price 
we historically have attempted to control a portion of our land supply through options 
as a result of the flexibility that these options provide us  upon a change in market conditions we may renegotiate the terms of the options prior to exercise or terminate the agreement 
under option contracts  purchase of the properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers and our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the non refundable deposits  letters of credit and other non refundable amounts incurred  which aggregated approximately million at september  this amount includes non refundable letters of credit of approximately million 
the total remaining purchase price  net of cash deposits  committed under all options was million as of september  when market conditions improve  we may expand our use of option agreements to supplement our owned inventory supply 
we expect to exercise  subject to market conditions  most of our option contracts 
various factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as market conditions  weather conditions and the timing of the completion of development activities  will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether land options will be exercised 
we have historically funded the exercise of land options through a combination of operating cash flows 
we expect these sources to continue to be adequate to fund anticipated future option exercises 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the exercise of our land options will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we participate in a number of land development joint ventures in which we have less than a controlling interest 
we enter into joint ventures in order to acquire attractive land positions  to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base 
our joint ventures are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in these joint ventures under the equity method 
our consolidated balance sheets include investments in joint ventures totaling million and million at september  and  respectively 
our joint ventures typically obtain secured acquisition and development financing 
at september   our unconsolidated joint ventures had borrowings outstanding totaling million  of which million related to one joint venture in which we are a partner 
generally  we and our joint venture partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
at september   we had repayment guarantees of million 
one of our unconsolidated joint ventures  in which we have a interest  is in default under its debt agreement at september  to the extent that we are unable to reach satisfactory resolutions  we may be called upon to perform under our applicable guarantees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that our exposure in this area is material to cash flows or earnings 
as of september   we had no variable rate debt outstanding 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at september  was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion 
in addition  the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rates would increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from billion to billion at september
