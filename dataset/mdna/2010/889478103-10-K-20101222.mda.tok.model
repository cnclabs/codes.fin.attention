item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless otherwise stated  net contracts signed represents a number or value equal to the gross number or value of contracts signed during the relevant period  less the number or value of contracts cancelled during the relevant period  which includes contracts that were signed during the relevant period and in prior periods 
overview this housing downturn is the longest and most severe since the great depression 
however  we believe that the medium and long term futures for our company and industry are bright 
a recent harvard university study projects that under both low and high growth scenarios housing demand should exceed that of the previous three decades 
with very low housing production over the past few years  we believe that pent up demand exists and it will be released once the employment and economic picture improves and as people regain confidence in a home as a dependable investment 
in many markets  the pipeline of approved and improved home sites has dwindled as builders and developers have lacked both the capital and the rationale for bringing sites through approvals 
therefore  when demand picks up  builders and developers with approved land in well located markets will be poised to benefit 
we believe that this will be particularly true for us 
our land portfolio is heavily weighted to the metro dc to metro boston corridor where land is scarce  approvals are more difficult to obtain and overbuilding has been relatively less prevalent than in the southeast and western regions 
the us housing market continues to struggle from a significant slowdown that began in the fourth quarter of our fiscal the value of our net contracts signed in fiscal was lower than the value of our net contracts signed in fiscal  higher than the value of our net contracts signed in fiscal and and lower than the value of our net contracts signed in fiscal and  respectively 
the slowdown  which we believe started with a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale  has been exacerbated by  among other things  a decline in the overall economy  increased unemployment  the increased number of vacant homes  fear of job loss  a decline in home prices and the resulting reduction in home equity  the large number of homes that are vacant and homes that are or will be available due to foreclosures  the inability of some of our home buyers or some prospective buyers of their homes to sell their current home  the deterioration in the credit markets  and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we believe many of our markets and housing in general have reached bottom  however  we expect that there may be more periods of volatility in the future 
we do not expect the housing market to recover in the near term 
we believe that  once the unemployment rate declines and confidence improves  pent up demand will be released and  gradually  more buyers will enter the market 
we believe that the key to a full recovery in our business depends on these factors as well as a sustained stabilization of financial markets and home prices 
in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and recorded a net loss of million 
in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and recorded a net loss of million and in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and recorded a net loss of million 
the losses recognized in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were due to the recognition of inventory impairment charges and write offs  joint venture impairment charges  the negative impact on profit margins of higher sales incentives given on the homes delivered during each of the fiscal years and the reduced level of construction activity 
fiscal results of operations benefited from the reversal of million of prior year valuation allowances through the carryback of losses recognized for income tax purposes in the current year that were recognized in prior years for financial reporting  offset  in part  by million of new valuation allowances recognized in fiscal the fiscal loss was also significantly impacted by million of valuation allowances recognized against our deferred tax assets 
we continue to seek a balance between our short term goal of selling homes in a tough market and our long term goal of maximizing the value of our communities 
we continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve 
we believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future and that this value should not necessarily be sacrificed in the current soft market 

table of contents we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions  many of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in the industry 
we believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long term value in creating relationships with high quality  affluent customers such as our home buyers  and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing 
we believe that our home buyers generally are  and should continue to be  better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan to value ratios and attractive credit profiles as compared to the average home buyer 
nevertheless  in recent years  tightened credit standards have shrunk the pool of potential home buyers and the availability of certain loan products previously available to our home buyers 
our home buyers continue to face stricter mortgage underwriting guidelines  higher down payment requirements and narrower appraisal guidelines than in the past 
however  recently we have seen some loosening of guidelines as they pertain to private mortgage insurance 
while the range of mortgage product available to a potential home buyer is not what it was in  it has improved in the past several months 
some of our home buyers continue to find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as their prospective buyers of such homes may face difficulties obtaining a mortgage 
in addition  other potential buyers may have little or negative equity in their existing homes and are not able or willing to purchase a larger or more expensive home 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which was enacted on july   provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgage lending practices  many of which are to be developed further by implementing rules 
these include  among others  minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in making mortgages  limitations on certain fees  prohibition of certain tying arrangements  and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings in the event of lender violations of fee limitations and minimum standards 
the ultimate effect of such provisions on lending institutions  including our mortgage subsidiary  will depend on the rules that are ultimately promulgated 
there has been significant media attention given to mortgage put backs  a practice in which a buyer of a mortgage loan tries to recoup losses from the loan originator 
we do not believe this is a material issue for our mortgage subsidiary 
only a very small number of our home buyers who used our mortgage subsidiary have defaulted on their loans 
we believe that this is due to i our typical home buyer s financial position and sophistication  ii on average  our home buyer paying approximately of the purchase price in cash  iii our general practice of not originating certain loan types such as option adjustable rate mortgages and down payment assistance products  and our origination of very few sub prime and high loan to value  no documentation loans  and iv our elimination of early payment default provisions from each of our agreements with our mortgage investors several years ago 
investors must demonstrate a material error on our part in issuing the mortgage or consumer fraud must exist in order for us to suffer a loss 
in addition  the amount of any such loss would be reduced by any proceeds received on the disposition of the collateral associated with the mortgage 
based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing industry  we believe that attractive land acquisition opportunities may arise in difficult times for those builders that have the financial strength to take advantage of them 
in the current challenging environment  we believe our strong balance sheet  liquidity  access to capital  broad geographic presence  diversified product line  experienced personnel and national brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
we have begun to see land being offered at prices that we believe are attractive based on current market conditions and in fiscal we entered into contracts to acquire approximately  home sites net of options terminated 
in fiscal  the number of home sites controlled  excluding the homes delivered during fiscal  declined by approximately  in addition  in fiscal  we formed gibraltar capital and asset management to invest in distressed real estate opportunities that may be different than our traditional homebuilding operations 
we continue to see reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders that had been our primary competitors in the luxury market 
we believe that many of these builders are no longer in business and that access by the surviving private builders to capital is already severely constrained 
we envision that there will be fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry when the market rebounds and that those lenders likely will gravitate to the homebuilding companies that offer them the greatest security  the strongest balance sheets and the broadest array of potential business opportunities 
we believe that this reduced competition  combined with attractive long term demographics  will reward those well capitalized builders that can persevere through the current challenging environment 

table of contents notwithstanding the current market conditions  we believe that geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital  and strong demographics have in the past and will in the future  as market conditions improve over time  benefit those builders that can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that these factors favor the large publicly traded homebuilding companies with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we believe that over the past five years  many builders and land developers reduced the number of home sites that were taken through the approval process 
the process continues to be difficult and lengthy  and the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase 
we believe our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come  as market conditions improve 
because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options also referred to herein as land purchase contracts or option and purchase agreements  thus allowing the necessary governmental approvals to be obtained before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
our risk reduction strategy of generally not commencing the construction of a home until we have an agreement of sale with a buyer was effective in the past but  due to the number of cancellations of agreements of sale that we had during the current downturn in the housing market  many of which were for homes on which we had commenced construction  the number of homes under construction in detached single family communities for which we do not have an agreement of sale increased from our historical levels 
over the past two years  however  we have reduced the number of these unsold units to more historical levels 
in addition  over the past several years  the number of our attached home communities has grown  resulting in an increase in the number of unsold units under construction 
in response to the decline in market conditions over the past several years  we have re evaluated and renegotiated or cancelled many of our land purchase contracts 
in addition  we have sold  and may continue to sell  certain parcels of land that we have identified as non strategic 
as a result  we reduced our land position from a high of approximately  home sites at april   to approximately  home sites at october  we continue to position ourselves for this recovery through the opportunistic and  we believe  prudent purchase of land and the continued growth of our community count 
based on our belief that the housing market has bottomed  the increased attractiveness of land available for purchase and the revival of demand in certain areas  we have begun to increase our land positions 
during fiscal  we acquired control of approximately  home sites net of options terminated  increasing the number of home sites controlled to approximately  home sites at october  of the  home sites controlled at october   we owned approximately  of these  home sites  significant improvements were completed on approximately  at october   we were selling from communities  compared to communities at october  for the first time in four years  we expect our community count will grow in fiscal we expect to be selling from to communities at october  in addition  at october   we had communities that were temporarily closed due to market conditions  of which we expect to reopen approximately prior to october  contracts and backlog the aggregate value of gross sales contracts signed decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of gross sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of gross contracts signed  offset  in part  by a slight increase in the average value of each contract signed 
the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of gross contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
our contract cancellation rate over the past months has been comparable to the cancellation rates prior to fiscal in fiscal  home buyers cancelled million homes of signed contracts  as compared to million homes in fiscal and million homes in fiscal as a percentage of the number of gross contracts signed in fiscal  and  home buyers cancelled  and  in those respective years  and  and of the value of gross contracts signed in those respective years 
in the last half of fiscal  we saw an improvement in our contract cancellation rate  in the fourth quarter and third quarter of fiscal  our contract cancellation rate the number of contracts cancelled in the period divided by the number of gross contracts signed in the period was and  respectively  as compared to and in the comparable periods of fiscal 
table of contents the aggregate value of net sales contracts signed increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the value of such contracts was billion  homes in fiscal  as compared to billion  homes in fiscal this increase was the result of a increase in the number of net contracts signed and a increase in the average value of each contract signed 
the increase in the average value of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to a lower average value of the contracts cancelled in fiscal  as compared to the average value of contracts cancelled in fiscal  and lower sales incentives given to home buyers in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the aggregate value of net sales contracts signed decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the value of net sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal and billion  homes in fiscal the decrease in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of a decrease in the number of net contracts signed and a decrease in the average value of each contract signed 
the decrease in the average value of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the higher average value of the contracts cancelled  higher sales incentives given to home buyers  and a shift in the number of contracts signed to less expensive areas and or products in fiscal  as compared to fiscal at october   our backlog of homes under contract was million  homes  lower than our million  homes backlog at october  our backlog at october  of billion  homes was higher than our backlog at october  backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers 
the decreases in backlog at october   as compared to the backlog at october  and at october   as compared to october   were primarily attributable to the continued decline in the new home market in fiscal and  and the decrease in the value and number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as well as in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by lower deliveries in both fiscal and  as compared to the preceding fiscal years

critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists  in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs also include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
for those communities that have been temporarily closed  no additional interest is allocated to the community s inventory until it re opens  and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community  it can typically take four or more years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to ten years or more to complete 
because of the downturn in our business  the estimated community lives will likely be significantly longer 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under gaap  we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 

table of contents current communities when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community s carrying value  the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community 
the impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community  we use various estimates such as a the expected sales pace in a community  based upon general economic conditions that will have a short term or long term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market  including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders  b the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community  c costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future  including  but not limited to  land and land development costs  home construction costs  interest costs and overhead costs  d alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace  sales price  building cost or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community  and e alternative uses for the property  such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites 
future communities we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or optioned  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for current communities described above  as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals  the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them 
concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets  dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land under contract to be purchased  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off 
the write off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write off is determined 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write offs related to current and future communities 
the table below provides  for the periods indicated  the number of operating communities that we tested for potential impairment  the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges  the amount of impairment charges recognized  and  as of the end of the period indicated  the fair value of those communities  net of impairment charges amounts in millions 
impaired communities fair value of communities number of net of communities number of impairment impairment three months ended tested communities charges charges fiscal january april july october fiscal january april july october fiscal january april july october 
table of contents variable interest entities we have land purchase contracts and several investments in unconsolidated entities which we evaluate for consolidation in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with gaap  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of a variable interest entity vie is considered to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
a vie is an entity with insufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors lack some of the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for land purchase contracts with sellers meeting the definition of a vie  we perform a review to determine which party is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this review requires substantial judgment and estimation 
these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the entity s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of the land under contract 
at october   the company had determined that land purchase contracts  with an aggregate purchase price of million  on which it had made aggregate deposits totaling million  were vies  and that it was not the primary beneficiary of any vie related to its land purchase contracts 
income taxes valuation allowance significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with gaap  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on gaap s more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  on business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods carryforward period assumptions  it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
if our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively positive verifiable evidence to support the likely realization of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets 
since the beginning of fiscal  we recorded significant deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets were generated primarily by inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities 
in accordance with gaap  we assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
we believe that the continued downturn in the housing market  the uncertainty as to its length and magnitude  and our continued recognition of impairment charges are significant evidence of the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets 
we are allowed to carry forward tax losses for years and apply such tax losses to future taxable income to realize federal deferred tax assets 
in addition  we will be able to reverse previously recognized valuation allowances during any future period in which we report book income before taxes 
we will continue to review our deferred tax assets in accordance with gaap 

table of contents on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act was enacted into law 
the act amended section of the internal revenue code to allow net operating losses realized in a tax year ending after december  and beginning before january  to be carried back for up to five years such losses were previously limited to a two year carryback 
this change allowed us to carry back our fiscal taxable losses to prior years and recognize a tax benefit of million in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal in addition  the act will allow us to file for a refund of previously paid federal income taxes 
we estimate that we will be able to carryback million of fiscal tax losses and receive a tax refund in fiscal of approximately million 
the ultimate amount of such refunds realized is dependent on our actual taxable losses for fiscal  which may vary significantly from its current expectations 
we have reflected the expected refund of million in our october  consolidated financial statements 
for state tax purposes  due to past losses and projected future losses in certain jurisdictions where we do not have carryback potential and or cannot sufficiently forecast future taxable income  we recognized net cumulative valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets of million as of october  and future valuation allowances in these jurisdictions may continue to be recognized if we believe we will not generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize future state deferred tax assets 
revenue and cost recognition the construction time of our homes is generally less than one year  although some homes may take more than one year to complete 
revenues and cost of revenues from these home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
in addition  we have several high rise mid rise projects that do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting in accordance with gaap that are included in this category of revenues and costs 
during fiscal and  we completed construction on four projects for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize revenues and costs  the remaining units in these projects have been or will be accounted for using the completed contract method of accounting 
based upon the current accounting rules and interpretations  we do not believe that any of our current communities qualify for percentage of completion accounting 
for our standard attached and detached homes  land  land development and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
for high rise mid rise projects  land  land development  construction and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered 
forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit 
sales incentives in order to promote sales of our homes  we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time 
these incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community by community and home by home basis 
incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid  such as special or additional options  are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues 
incentives that we pay to an outside party  such as paying some or all of a home buyer s closing costs  are recorded as an additional cost of revenues 
incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds 
off balance sheet arrangements the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general and are discussed in the overview section have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
we review each of our investments in unconsolidated entities on a quarterly basis to determine the recoverability of our investment 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in unconsolidated entities using similar methodology that we use to evaluate our inventories 
this evaluation entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates including  but not limited to  expected sales pace  expected sales prices  expected incentives  costs incurred and anticipated  sufficiency of financing and capital  competition  and market conditions 
when markets deteriorate and it is no longer probable that we can recover our investment in a joint venture  we impair our investment 
if a joint venture has its own loans or is principally a joint venture to hold an option  such impairment may result in the majority or all of our investment being impaired 
see critical accounting policies inventory for more detailed disclosure on our evaluation of inventory 

table of contents we have investments in and advances to various unconsolidated entities 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities  net of impairment charges recognized  of million  and were committed to invest or advance million net of amounts accrued of additional funds to certain of these entities if they require additional funding 
at october   we had accrued million of our commitments to our unconsolidated entities 
in addition  we guarantee certain debt of a number of these unconsolidated entities on a several and pro rata basis 
at october   we guaranteed an aggregate of approximately million net of amounts that we have accrued of debt relating to three joint ventures  which had aggregate borrowings of approximately million 
in connection with certain land joint ventures to which we are a party  we executed completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees 
the obligations under the completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees are several and not joint  and are limited to our pro rata share of the loan obligations of the respective joint ventures 
at october   the maximum amount of the completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees net of amounts that we have accrued is estimated to be approximately million  if any liability is determined to be due thereunder  which amount is included in the million of guarantees disclosed above 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and a net loss of million  as compared to billion of revenues and a net loss of million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we recognized million and million of inventory impairments and write offs  respectively 
in fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million  as compared to an income tax provision of million in fiscal in addition  we recognized million of joint venture impairment charges and write offs in fiscal revenues and cost of revenues revenues in fiscal were lower than those in fiscal by approximately million  or 
this decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in the number of homes in backlog at october   as compared to october   offset  in part  by a increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a shift in product mix to lower priced product  offset  in part  by a decrease in sales incentives  as a percentage of the homes gross sales price  given on homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal average sales incentives given on homes delivered in fiscal amounted to approximately  per home or of the gross price of the home delivered  as compared to approximately  per home or of the gross price of the home delivered in fiscal the decrease in per home sales incentives in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower sales incentives provided on contracts in backlog at october   as compared to value of sales incentives on contracts in backlog at october   and the decrease in sales incentives given on contracts signed in fiscal that were delivered in fiscal  as compared to contracts signed in fiscal and delivered in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
interest cost as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the higher interest cost as a percentage of revenue was due to inventory generally being held for a longer period of time  fewer qualifying assets to which interest can be allocated which resulted in higher amounts of capitalized interest allocated to qualifying inventory  and lower average prices of homes delivered 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  excluding impairments and interest  was of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal this decline was primarily due to lower incentives given on homes delivered and lower overhead and closing costs  offset  in part  by higher cost of land  land improvement and house construction costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expense decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the reduction in sg a expense in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower compensation and related costs  reduced advertising  promotion and model operating costs  reduced insurance costs and a decrease in the write off of deferred marketing costs related to closed communities 
interest expense interest incurred on average homebuilding indebtedness in excess of average qualified inventory is charged directly to the statement of operations in the period incurred 
interest expensed directly to the statement of operations in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal due to the lower amounts of qualified inventory 
income loss from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust and trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from these entities 
the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general and that are discussed in the overview section have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entity are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year

in addition  in fiscal  we reversed million of valuation allowances previously recognized 
the decline in the valuation allowances recognized in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to the decline in the amount of inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities recognized in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the reversal of valuation allowances previously recognized in fiscal is due to our expected recovery of certain deferred tax assets through our ability to carryback fiscal tax losses to prior years and receive a refund of the applicable federal taxes 
the recovery of deferred tax assets principally related to inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities recognized for income tax purposes in fiscal that were recognized for book purposes in prior years 
see critical accounting policies income taxes valuation allowance  above  for information regarding the valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents excluding valuation adjustments  the difference in the effective tax rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a the reversal in fiscal of million of accruals against potential tax assessments  which were no longer needed due to our settlement of various federal and state audits and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for federal and state tax purposes  as compared to million in fiscal  b the recording of million of unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  c the recognition of million of interest and penalties in fiscal  as compared to million of interest and penalties recognized in fiscal  d the recognition of a million state tax benefit  before valuation allowance  in fiscal  as compared to a million state tax benefit  before valuation allowance  recognized in fiscal  and e the loss of tax credits recognized in years prior to fiscal that were lost due to the elimination of taxable income in those years as a result of the carryback of fiscal tax losses 
the increase in the interest and penalties recognized is due to the increase in number of tax years open to assessment and potential additional taxes due the decline in the state tax benefit is due primarily to the decline in the reported loss in fiscal  as compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and cost of revenues in fiscal  we recognized billion of revenues and a net loss of million  as compared to billion of revenues and a net loss of million in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized inventory and joint venture impairment charges and write offs of million  as compared to million of inventory and joint venture impairment charges and write offs in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we recognized million of valuation allowances against our federal and state deferred tax assets  as compared to million of valuation allowances against our state deferred tax assets in fiscal see critical accounting policies income taxes valuation allowance above for an expanded discussion relating to the valuation allowances recognized 
excluding million of revenues recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method in fiscal  revenues in fiscal were lower than those in fiscal by approximately billion  or 
this decrease was attributable to a decrease in the number of homes delivered and a decrease in the average price of the homes delivered 
the decrease in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in our backlog at october   as compared to our backlog at october   and a decrease in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the impact of a shift in product mix to lower priced product and less expensive areas  and an increase in incentives given on homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal average sales incentives given on homes delivered in fiscal amounted to approximately  per home or of the gross sales price of the home  as compared to approximately  per home  or of the gross sales price of the home  in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal and  we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million and million  respectively 
cost of revenues  excluding inventory impairment charges and write offs collectively home costs  was of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in the home costs percentage was due primarily to higher sales incentives on the homes delivered  higher interest costs and a change in the mix of product delivered 
sales incentives as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal and in fiscal interest cost as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the higher interest cost percentage in fiscal was due to inventory generally being held for a longer period of time and fewer qualifying assets to which interest can be allocated  resulting in higher amounts of capitalized interest allocated to qualifying inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending decreased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the reduction in spending was due primarily to reduced compensation and related costs and reduced costs for advertising  promotions and marketing offset  in part  by the expensing of interest incurred not eligible to be capitalized in fiscal and the higher amount of deferred marketing costs that were written off with regard to communities that were temporarily closed  sold or redesigned in fiscal  as compared to fiscal due to the decline in qualified inventory  interest incurred on homebuilding indebtedness exceeded amounts eligible for capitalization in fiscal by million  which was expensed to sg a in fiscal prior to november   qualified inventory exceeded homebuilding indebtedness and all interest incurred was capitalized

table of contents goodwill impairment during fiscal  due to the continued decline of the nevada and florida housing markets  we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of two small home builders in these markets 
we estimated the fair value of our assets in these markets  including goodwill 
fair value was determined based on the discounted future cash flow expected to be generated in these markets 
based upon this evaluation and our expectation that these markets would not recover for a number of years  we determined that the related goodwill had been impaired 
we recognized million of impairment charges in fiscal after recognizing these charges  we did not have any goodwill remaining on our balance sheet at october  loss from unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in toll brothers realty trust trust and toll brothers realty trust ii trust ii 
we recognize our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from these entities 
the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general and that are discussed in overview have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
many of our joint ventures are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  the joint ventures will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all the assets of the entity are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of losses from unconsolidated entities  as compared to million of losses in fiscal the loss in fiscal was attributable to million of impairment charges recognized on our investments in unconsolidated entities 
the loss in fiscal was attributable to million of impairment charges recognized on our investments in unconsolidated entities

table of contents the difference in the effective tax rates in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  excluding the deferred tax asset valuation allowances that we recognized  was primarily due to a the increased reversal in fiscal  over fiscal  of state tax provision net of federal tax provision accrued in prior years against potential tax assessments  which were no longer needed due to our settlement of various federal and state audits and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for federal and state tax purposes  b a lower blended state tax rate in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the combination of a shift in the state tax jurisdictions where the losses occurred and the applicable state income tax rates in those jurisdictions  c the recognition of additional tax provision in fiscal due to uncertainties of tax positions taken on prior year tax returns  d the reversal of tax credits recognized in prior years that will be lost due to the elimination of taxable income in those years due to the carryback of tax losses  and e an increase in the fiscal rates due to tax free income recognized in fiscal but not in fiscal we operate in states and are subject to various state tax jurisdictions 
we estimate our state tax liability based upon the individual taxing authorities regulations  estimates of income by taxing jurisdiction and our ability to utilize certain tax saving strategies 
due primarily to a change in our estimate of the allocation of income or loss  as the case may be  among the various state taxing jurisdictions and changes in tax regulations and their impact on our strategies  we estimated that our state income tax rate  net of a federal tax benefit  was for fiscal and for fiscal capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been and continues to be provided principally by cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
prior to fiscal  we used our cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity offerings to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our backlog  invest in unconsolidated entities  purchase our stock and repay debt 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable us treasury and agency securities on hand and approximately million available under our new million revolving credit facility which extends to october during fiscal  we used available cash to repay a million bank term loan and repurchase or redeem million of our senior and senior subordinated notes 
since october   we have increased our cash position including marketable us treasury and agency securities by approximately million and reduced debt by approximately million 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable us treasury and agency securities on hand  a decrease of million compared to october  in fiscal  cash flow used in operating activities was million 
cash used in operating activities during fiscal was primarily used to acquire inventory  collateralize approximately million of letters of credit and fund an increase in mortgage loan originations in excess of mortgage loan sales  offset  in part  by cash flow generated from our earnings before inventory impairments  depreciation and amortization 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments in marketable us treasury and agency securities and for investments made in our unconsolidated entities 
we also used million of cash in financing activities in fiscal  principally for the repayment of our million bank term loan  million for the redemption of senior and senior subordinated notes  and repayment of million of other loans payable  offset  in part  by million of net borrowings on our mortgage company warehouse loan  million of proceeds from stock based benefit plans and million of tax benefits from stock based compensation 
in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents and marketable us treasury securities increased by million 
in fiscal  cash flow provided by operating activities was million 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by a reduction in inventory and the receipt of income tax refunds on previously paid taxes  offset  in part  by the payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income tax payments made for the settlement of previously accrued tax audits 
the decreases in inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the decline in our business as previously discussed 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments in marketable us treasury securities and for investments in our unconsolidated entities 
we also generated a net of million of cash from financing activities in fiscal  principally from the issuance of an aggregate of million principal amount of senior notes in the public debt markets net proceeds amounted to million  million of other borrowings primarily from our mortgage company warehouse loan  and issuance of securities under our stock based benefit plans and the tax benefits of stock based compensation  offset  in part  by the redemption of  and tender for  an aggregate of million principal amount of senior and senior subordinated notes  million of expenses related to such redemption and tender offer  and the repayment of million of other borrowings  of which million was on our mortgage company warehouse loan 

table of contents in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to billion 
cash flow from operating activities was million 
cash flow from operating activities was generated primarily from income before inventory and investment impairment losses  reductions in inventory and a decrease in contracts receivable related to percentage of completion accounting  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses excluding accruals of estimated liabilities to various joint ventures  a decrease in customer deposits and an increase in deferred tax assets 
the decreased inventory  contracts receivable  accounts payable and customer deposits were primarily due to the decline in our business as previously discussed 
we used million of cash flow in investing activities  primarily for additional investments in unconsolidated entities 
in addition  we used million of cash flow in financing activities  primarily for the repayment of debt  offset in part by cash generated from issuance of securities under our stock based benefit plans and the tax benefits of stock based compensation 
in general  our cash flow from operating activities assumes that  as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace those which we deliver 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our single family detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer  although in the past several years  due to the high cancellation rate of customer contracts and the increase in the number of attached home communities from which we were operating all of the units of which are generally not sold prior to the commencement of construction  the number of speculative homes in our inventory increased significantly 
should our business remain at its current level or further decline  we believe that our inventory levels would continue to decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  as we complete the improvements on the land we already own and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in additional cash flow from operations 
in addition  we might continue to delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  as we have since the second half of fiscal  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
at october   we owned or controlled through options approximately  home sites  as compared to approximately  at october    at october  and approximately  at april   the high point of our home sites owned and controlled 
of the  home sites owned or controlled through options at october   we owned  of our owned home sites  significant improvements were completed on approximately  at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately million including million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested 
of the million of land purchase commitments  we had paid or deposited million  we will receive a credit for prior investments in joint ventures of approximately million and  if we acquire all of these land parcels  we will be required to pay an additional million 
of the million we would be required to pay  we recorded million of this amount in accrued expenses at october  the purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years 
we have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts 
during the past several years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and to investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows under cash flow used in investing activities 
in october  we entered into an million revolving credit facility with banks  which extends to october the facility replaced a billion credit facility consisting of a billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility with banks  which extended to march  prior to the closing of the new credit facility  we repaid the term loan under the old credit facility from cash on hand 
at october   we had no outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility but had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
at october   interest would have been payable on borrowings under our credit facility at subject to adjustment based upon our debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
we are obligated to pay an undrawn commitment fee of subject to adjustment based upon our debt rating and leverage ratios based on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are not permitted to allow our maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement to exceed to  and we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the credit agreement of approximately billion at october  at october   our leverage ratio was approximately to  and our tangible net worth was approximately billion 
based upon the minimum tangible net worth requirement  our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock was limited to an aggregate amount of approximately million at october  in addition  at october   we had million of letters of credit outstanding with three banks which were not part of our new credit facility  these letters of credit were collateralized by million of cash deposits 

table of contents in fiscal  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due and million principal amount of senior notes due we received million of aggregate net proceeds from the issuances of these senior notes

in august  tbi mortgage company  our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary  entered into a master repurchase agreement with comerica bank  as agent and representative of itself as a buyer and the other buyers named therein 
the agreement replaced tbi mortgage company s warehouse credit facility which expired in august the purpose of the agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by tbi mortgage company 
the agreement provides for loan purchases up to million  subject to certain sublimits 
in addition  the agreement provides for an accordion feature under which tbi mortgage company may request that the aggregate commitments under the agreement be increased to an amount up to million 
the agreement  as amended  expires on july  we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
due to the deterioration of the credit markets and the uncertainties that exist in the economy and for home builders in general  we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt 
of the amounts indicated  billion of the senior notes  million of loans payable and million of the mortgage company warehouse loan were recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
b amounts represent our expected acquisition of land under options or purchase agreements and the estimated remaining amount of the contractual obligation for land development agreements secured by letters of credit and surety bonds 
of the total amount indicated  million was recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 
c amounts represent our obligations under our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans 
of the total amount indicated  million was recorded on the october  consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits 
prior to the current downturn in the economy and the decline in demand for homes  the sales prices of our homes generally increased 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
the slowdown in the homebuilding industry over the past several years and the decline in the sales prices of our homes  without a corresponding reduction in the costs  have had an adverse impact on our profitability 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt a weighted weighted average average fiscal year of interest interest maturity amount rate amount rate thereafter discount total fair value at october  a based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
