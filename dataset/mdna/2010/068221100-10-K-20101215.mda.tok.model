marketing of oil and natural gas barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short term contracts between itself and marketers of oil 
the price of oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers and is largely determined by the world price for oil  which is principally denominated in us dollars 
natural gas sold by barnwell is generally sold under both long term and short term contracts with prices indexed to market prices 
the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and is principally determined for barnwell by western canadian midwestern us prices for natural gas 
in fiscal and  barnwell took virtually all of its oil and natural gas in kind where barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on barnwell s behalf 
barnwell s oil and natural gas segment derived of its oil and natural gas revenues in fiscal from three individually significant customers  shell trading canada  progas limited and glencoe resources ltd 

a substantial portion of barnwell s natural gas production from dunvegan and other properties is sold to aggregators and marketers under various short term and long term contracts  with the price of natural gas determined by negotiations between the aggregators and the final purchasers 
in fiscal  of barnwell s production was marketed by an agent acting on behalf of barnwell where all products are sold directly to the final purchasers with the agent not taking title of the production 
in fiscal  over of barnwell s oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices 
governmental regulation the jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells  the spacing of wells  the prevention of oil and natural gas waste  allowable rates of production and other matters 
the amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province that periodically assign allowable rates of production 
the province of alberta and government of canada also monitor and regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal 

table of contents there is no current government regulation of the price that may be charged on the sale of canadian oil or natural gas production 
canadian natural gas production destined for export is priced by market forces subject to export contracts meeting certain criteria prescribed by canada s national energy board and the government of canada 
different royalty rates are imposed by the provincial governments  the government of canada and private interests with respect to the production and sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
in addition  provincial governments receive additional revenue through the imposition of taxes on oil and natural gas owned by private interests within the province 
essentially  provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes  selling prices and the date of discovery 
approximately of barnwell s gross revenues are derived from properties located within alberta 
the province of alberta charges oil and natural gas producers a royalty for production in alberta 
the province of alberta determines its royalty share of natural gas and oil by using reference prices that average all natural gas sales and oil sales  respectively  in alberta 
barnwell also pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its natural gas and oil sales to parties other than the province of alberta 
through december   royalty rates were calculated on a sliding scale basis  increasing as prices increased up to a maximum royalty rate of 
on january   a new royalty framework nrf went into effect 
the nrf changed royalty rates on conventional oil and natural gas production to be both price sensitive and production sensitive  and may increase up to a maximum royalty rate of 
the price sensitive maximum is reached for oil when oil is selling at or above canadian dollars per barrel and for natural gas when natural gas is selling at or above canadian dollars per mcf 
in fiscal  approximately of royalties related to alberta government charges and of royalties related to freehold and override charges which are not directly affected by the nrf 
in november  the alberta government announced a one time option of selecting new transitional rates or nrf rates when drilling a new natural gas or conventional oil well  to  meters in depth 
all wells drilled between january  and december  that adopt the transitional rates will be shifted to the nrf on january  as of january   all of barnwell s wells in alberta pay royalties under the nrf and all new commercial wells drilled since january  adopted the transitional royalty rates 
in  the government of alberta announced the results of its natural gas and conventional oil competitiveness review and published its policy response  energizing investment  a framework to improve alberta s natural gas and conventional oil competitiveness  which will modify alberta s royalty framework effective january  in june  the alberta government finalized the changes to the royalty framework which reduces the maximum royalty rate of for oil and natural gas production to and  respectively 
in fiscal  the weighted average royalty rate paid on all of barnwell s natural gas was approximately 
the weighted average rate of all royalties paid to governments and others on natural gas from the dunvegan unit  barnwell s principal oil and natural gas property  was approximately in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  the weighted average royalty rate paid on oil was approximately 
in  the alberta government announced a short term incentive program which included a drilling royalty credit for new conventional oil and natural gas wells 
the program provides a per meter drilled royalty credit to companies on a sliding scale based on production levels for wells drilled from april  to march  the alberta government has extended this program to march  during fiscal  the canadian government enacted reductions in the corporate tax rate from    and in calendar years    and  respectively  to    and  respectively 
there was no enactment of a reduction in canadian tax rates during fiscal or competition the majority of barnwell s natural gas sales take place in alberta  canada 
natural gas prices in alberta are generally competitive with other major north american areas due to sufficient pipeline capacity into the united states 
barnwell s oil and natural gas liquids are sold in alberta with prices determined by the world price for oil 
barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price and on the ability to deliver products 
the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases  including the exploration for new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities 
the competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators 
there is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial  technical and other resources

contract drilling segment overview barnwell s wholly owned subsidiary  water resources  drills water  water monitoring and geothermal wells of varying depths in hawaii  installs and repairs water pumping systems  and is the state of hawaii s distributor for floway pumps and equipment 
operations water resources owns and operates two spencer harris portable rotary drill rigs capable of drilling up to approximately  feet  an ideco h rotary drill workover rig  two gefco t portable rotary drill rigs  and other drilling  installation and service equipment 
water resources acquired the second gefco t drill rig in fiscal additionally  water resources leases a three quarter of an acre maintenance facility in honolulu  hawaii and a one acre maintenance and storage facility with  square feet of interior space in kawaihae  hawaii  and maintains an inventory of drilling materials and pump supplies 
water resources currently operates in hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the demand for water resources services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in hawaii 
water resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies  and identifies potential contracts through public notices  its officers involvement in community activities and referrals 
contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled or day rate contracts and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local  state and federal agencies 
contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water  geothermal production zones or other similar targets  and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved 
contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes 
water resources derived and of its contract drilling revenues in fiscal and  respectively  pursuant to federal  state of hawaii and county contracts 
at september   barnwell had accounts receivables from federal  state of hawaii and county entities totaling approximately  barnwell has lien rights on wells drilled and pumps installed for federal  state of hawaii  county and private entities 
in fiscal  water resources started five well drilling contracts and ten pump installation and repair contracts and completed five well drilling contracts and six pump installation and repair contracts 
three of the five completed well drilling contracts and three of the six pump installation and repair contracts were started in the prior year 
seventy nine percent of well drilling and pump installation and repair jobs  representing of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal  have been pursuant to government contracts 

table of contents at september   water resources had a backlog of four well drilling contracts and pump installation and repair contracts  of which three well drilling and seven pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of september  the dollar amount of water resources backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at december  and was as follows well drilling pump installation and repair all but one of the contracts in backlog at december  are expected to be completed within fiscal year competition water resources competes with other drilling contractors in hawaii which use drill rigs similar to water resources drilling rigs 
these competitors are also capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in hawaii 
these contractors compete actively with water resources for government and private contracts 
pricing is water resources major method of competition  reliability of service is also a significant factor 
competitive pressures are expected to remain high  thus there is no assurance that the quantity of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal will continue

environmental costs barnwell is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 
federal  state  and canadian governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply  particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment 
these laws  which are constantly changing  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of surface conditions and may require barnwell to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites 
barnwell did not incur material environmental costs in fiscal

risk factors the business of barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks  including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this form k or in barnwell s other filings with the sec 
the risks described below are not the only risks that barnwell faces  nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance 
if any of the following risk factors should occur  our profitability  financial condition or liquidity could be materially impacted 
risks related to oil and natural gas segment the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete for capital  acquisitions of reserves  undeveloped lands  skilled personnel  access to drilling rigs  service rigs and other equipment  access to processing facilities  pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations  many of which may have greater technical and financial resources than we do 
some of these organizations explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas  carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis 
as a result of these complementary activities  some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours 
furthermore  many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production  such as changing prices and production levels  the cost an d availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 
if our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources  it could adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
our results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on the prices of and demand for our oil and natural gas production 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  weather  worldwide political instability  foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the level of consumer product demand  government regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment 
any decline in oil or natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  operating cash flows  borrowing ability  reserves  and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves and future growth 
energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control  which may include changes in the policies of the organization of petroleum exporting countries or other developments involving or affecting oil producing countries  or actions or reactions of the government of the united states in anticipation of or in response to such developments 
if oil and natural gas prices decrease  we may be required to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  the net book value of properties less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed a calculated ceiling 
the ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties  discounted at per year 
in calculating discounted future net revenues  average first day of the month oil and natural gas prices during the month period ending in the reporting period are held constant  except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts 
the excess  if any  of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense 
a significant decline in oil and natural gas prices from current levels  or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could r esult in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings 
an increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us 
electricity  supplies  and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation 
a significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow 
the level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances  many of which are beyond our control 
a significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow 
our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce 
our business depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
canadian federal and provincial  as well as united states federal and state  regulation of oil and natural gas production  processing and transportation  tax and energy policies  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
if market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production  overall production or realized prices may decline 

table of contents we are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties 
we hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties 
as a result  we cannot control the pace of exploration or development  major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non operated properties  although contract provisions give barnwell certain consent rights in some matters 
the operator s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures 
additionally  as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us  we depend on the operators at non operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information 
our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks  particularly in canada and the united states 
barnwell s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations  particularly in canada and the united states  such as restrictions on production  restrictions on imports and exports  the maintenance of specified reserves  tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation of property  cancellation of contract rights  environmental protection controls  environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety 
further  the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in alberta  saskatchewan and british columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces 
changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases  permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on barnwell s operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in canada 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our oil and natural gas segment revenues from operations in canada 
additionally  our ability to compete in the canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests 
furthermore  we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the us government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety  environmental protection  pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination 
environmental regulations  in particular  prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical  increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault 
in addition  governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities  reducing demand for our products and services 
compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations 
tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local  regional and national authorities 
income tax laws  other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders 
it is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in canada  including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes  and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 

table of contents we are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves 
we actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves 
however  future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs 
despite this uncertainty or potential cost  discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 
as a result  future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves 
if our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable  our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives 
without these reserve additions  our reserves will deplete and as a consequence  either production from  or the average reserve life of  our properties will decline 
actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates 
estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates 
ultimately  actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates  and those variations may be material 
the estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions  including  among others oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by the sec  historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area  future commodity prices  production and development costs  royalties and capital expenditures  initial production rates  production decline rates  ultimate recovery of reserves  success of future development activities  marketability of production  effects of government regulation  and other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves 
if these factors  assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate  actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates 
delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions 
in addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties  and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us  payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by restrictions imposed by lenders  accounting delays  
table of contents delays in the sale or delivery of products  delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system  blowouts or other accidents  adjustments for prior periods  recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties  and the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses 
any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks 
the industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties  including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas 
these risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures  premature declines of reservoirs  blow outs  equipment failures and other accidents  cratering  sour gas releases  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  adverse weather conditions  pollution  other environmental risks  fires and spills 
a number of these risks could result in personal injury  loss of life  or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others 
while we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance  we could be affected by civil  criminal  regulatory or administrative actions  claims or proceedings 
we cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above  nor are all of these risks insurable 
there is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above 
we could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks  or  even if available  that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in th e future  so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive 
we may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health  safety  and environmental laws and regulations 
the oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local  provincial and federal legislation 
a violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders 
legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations 
for example  the kyoto protocol to the united nation s framework convention on climate change  known as the kyoto protocol  was ratified by the canadian government in december and will require  among other things  significant reductions in greenhouse gases 
the impact of the kyoto protocol on us is uncertain and may result in significant additional costs for our future operations 
although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations 

table of contents we are not fully insured against certain environmental risks  either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
in particular  insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time  as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages  is not available on economically reasonable terms 
accordingly  any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow 
should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem  we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy 
we may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures  which could have an adverse affect on our business 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects 
without adequate capital resources  our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we may not be able to secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements 
if capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail our drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms 
any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves 
although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property  such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets 
if such a defect were to occur  our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized 
risks related to land investment segment the real estate investment industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period 
this downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business  results of operations and stockholders equity 
the real estate investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local  regional  and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates  housing demand  population growth  employment levels  job growth and property taxes 
further  a weakening of the economic drivers in hawaii  which include tourism  military spending  construction starts and employment  and a decrease in market demand adversely impacted the level of real estate activity in hawaii 
the industry has experienced a significant decrease in demand for new homes since and this trend may continue for an extended period of time 
economic conditions in the united states have also weakened  which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate 
these challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and  in the near term  these conditions may further deteriorate 
we expect that continued weakness in the industry could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents considerable economic and political uncertainties currently exist that could have adverse effects on consumer buying habits  construction costs  availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general 
significant expenditures associated with investment in real estate  such as real estate taxes  insurance  maintenance costs and debt payments  cannot generally be reduced even though changes in hawaii s or the nation s economy may cause a decrease in revenues from our properties 
our real estate business is concentrated in the state of hawaii 
as a result  our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of hawaii  particularly the island of hawaii 
barnwell s land investment segment is affected by the condition of hawaii s real estate market 
the hawaii real estate market is affected by hawaii s economy and hawaii s tourism industry  as well as the united states economy in general 
any future cash flows from barnwell s land development activities are subject to  among other factors  the level of real estate activity and prices  the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of hawaii  the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor  the introduction of building code modifications  changes to zoning laws  and the level of confidence in hawaii s economy 
the future economic growth in certain portions of the island of hawaii may be adversely affected if its infrastructure  such as roads  airports  medical facilities and schools  are not impro ved to meet increased demand 
there can be no assurance that these improvements will occur 
the occurrence of natural disasters in hawaii could adversely affect our business 
the occurrence of a natural disaster in hawaii such as  but not limited to  earthquakes  landslides  hurricanes  tornadoes  volcanic activity  droughts and floods  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects 
the occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause increases in property and flood insurance rates and deductibles  which could reduce demand for our properties 
increases in interest rates  tightening of lending standards and decreases  limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgage financing and other economic factors outside our control  such as consumer confidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
the united states residential mortgage market continues to experience disruption 
mortgage interest rates have been experiencing significant volatility and contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and the industry 
in addition  as a result of increased default rates and other factors  the willingness of many lenders to make home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lending standards 
the volatility in interest rates  the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans  and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of our homes 
potential buyers may not be able to obtain acceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the kaupulehu area  leading to further declines in the market for homes 
any limitations or restrict ions on the availability of mortgage financing or increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce residential lot sales  thereby reducing our revenues and earnings 
even if potential buyers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing  further interest rate increases or limits on the deductibility of home mortgages could adversely affect our sales  which would reduce our revenues 

table of contents our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations 
we are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations  including those related to the use  storage  discharge  emission  and disposal of hazardous materials 
any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations  or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held 
receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developer s continued efforts to develop and market the property 
we are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately acres in the kaupulehu area 
however  in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop and market the homes and lots 
the receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property 
if required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs  or at all  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we hold the leasehold interest to approximately  acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation 
our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the state of hawaii land use commission and county of hawaii 
obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult  costly and may take several years  or more  to complete 
delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results 
environmental and other regulations may have an adverse effect on our business 
our properties are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations 
in most cases  approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long  uncertain and costly regulatory process 
the value of our lot acquisition rights could be impaired if the developer of the property is unable to obtain required land use entitlements or successfully negotiate development terms and agreements 
we hold acquisition rights to lots in agricultural zoned leasehold lands in the upland area of kaupulehu mauka lands situated between the queen kaahumanu highway and the mamalahoa highway at kaupulehu  north kona  island and state of hawaii 
the lot acquisition rights give us the right to purchase residential lots which may be developed on the mauka lands 
the ability to purchase residential lots and the value of such lots in the future is contingent upon the developer of the property obtaining the necessary land use reclassification  zoning and development approvals from regulatory entities 
obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult  costly and may take several years  or more  to complete 
delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification and rezoning approvals may adversely affect our f inancial results 
our ability to purchase lots and the value of such lots is also contingent upon the ability of the developer of the property to successfully negotiate development terms and agreements within the mauka lands 
if the developer is unsuccessful in such negotiations  our ability to purchase residential lots in the mauka lands would be impaired 

table of contents the market value of our real estate interests could decline  which may require write downs of the carrying value of our residential lots held for investment to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would negatively impact our results of operations 
the risk of owning undeveloped lots can be substantial and we may have bought lots which we cannot profitably sell 
the market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions 
prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcels held for investment 
in the event of changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell the residential lots at lower margins or at a loss 
furthermore  if the market conditions continue to deteriorate  we may be required to record write downs of the carrying value of our residential parcels held for investment 
such write downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to residential real estate segment the homebuilding industry continues to experience a slowdown that may persist for an indefinite period 
this downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our business  results of operations and stockholders equity 
the homebuilding industry historically has been cyclical and is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as employment levels  consumer confidence  consumer income  availability of financing and interest rate levels 
adverse changes in any of these conditions generally  or in the market in which we operate  could decrease demand and pricing for new homes or result in customer cancellations of pending contracts  which could adversely affect the number of home deliveries we make or reduce the prices we can charge for homes  either of which could result in a reduction in our revenues or deterioration of our margins 
the homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and sustained downturn characterized by decreased demand for new homes  an oversupply of both new and resale home inventories  including foreclosed homes  aggressive price competition among homebuilders  including increased incentives for home sales  and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment 
economic conditions in the united states have also weakened recently  which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate 
these challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and  in the near term  these conditions may further deteriorate 
continued weakness in the homebuilding industry could further adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are reliant upon sales of homes as a source of liquidity 
if we are unable to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe  our revenues  operating results  cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted 
barnwell currently owns two luxury residences held for sale in the lot a increment i area of kaupulehu  north kona  hawaii 

table of contents the acquisition of the parcels and home construction costs on the luxury homes were financed through a bank revolving credit facility and subsequently modified under a non revolving credit facility 
under the modified agreement  we are required to make a scheduled principal payment of  per quarter 
if we sell one of the homes  the quarterly payment will be reduced to  per quarter 
the entire unpaid principal balance and any accrued interest is due in full in february  unless we sell a home and lot before then  in which case we will be required to make a principal payment upon the sale of a home and lot in an amount equal to the greater of of the net sales proceeds of the home and lot or  for each of the two lots and  for each of the two homes 
the timing and amount of residential home sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic 
the inability to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest costs 
additionally  if we are unable to sell the homes within a reasonable timeframe  we will need to refinance the debt  obtain alternative terms or sources of financing  liquidate investments and or operating assets  or reduce oil and natural gas capital expenditures to make the required cash outflows 
this would negatively impact our liquidity 
furthermore  if estimated cash inflows from home sales do not occur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations  our revenues  operating results  cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted 
if we are unable to sell the homes by february  the due date of the facility  and we are unable to refinance our debt  we will need to obtain alternative terms or sources of financing or liquidate investments and or operating assets to repay the facility on its due date 
we have limited experience in the homebuilding industry 
homebuilding is a new business segment for us and we are relying to a material extent on our business partners to help us execute our business plan 
we may need financing to fund our future real estate development activities 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing or such financing is obtained on adverse terms  we may not be able to operate our business as planned  which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth 
the real estate development industry is capital intensive and homebuilding requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
we will need to establish funding sources to finance any future land acquisition capital expenditures 
if such sources are not sufficient  we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources  including additional bank financing  joint venture partner financing  and or securities offerings 
the amount and types of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt 
in addition  the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition  development and construction may be greatly reduced  and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by bo rrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans 
the failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable 
due to the cyclical nature of the real estate development industry  we expect to experience variability in our future operating results on a quarterly and an annual basis 
factors expected to contribute to this variability include  among other things the timing of land acquisitions and permitting  the timing of home closings  land sales and level of home sales  our ability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms  the condition of the real estate market and the general economy  and delays in construction due to natural disasters  adverse weather  reduced contractor availability and strikes 
for example  the timing of land acquisitions and permitting impacts our ability to pursue the development of new housing projects in accordance with our business plan 
if the timing of land acquisitions  zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed  we will be delayed in our ability to develop housing projects  which would likely decrease our backlog 
furthermore  these delays could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequent periods until the planned housing projects can be completed 
a delay in home closings due to natural disasters  adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur 
further  revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delays described above are resolved 
changes in the government regulations applicable to homebuilders could restrict our business activities  increase our operating expenses and cause our revenues to decline 
regulatory requirements applicable to homebuilders could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities 
we are subject to local  state and federal statutes and rules regulating  among other things  certain developmental matters  building and site design  and matters concerning the protection of worker health and safety  and the environment 
our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations  such as building permit allocation ordinances  impact and other fees and taxes  which may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements 
other governmental regulations  such as building moratoriums and no growth or slow growth initiatives  which may be adopted in communities which have developed rapidly  may cause delays in our home projects or otherwise restrict our business activities resulting in reductions in our revenues 
any delay or refusal to grant us necessary licenses  permits or approvals from government agencies could cause substantial increases to development costs or cause us to abandon the project and to sell the affected land at a potential loss  which in turn could harm our operating results 
our residential real estate segment is dependent on the continued availability and satisfactory performance of our building contractors  which  if unavailable  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we conduct our construction operations through unaffiliated building contractors 
as a consequence  we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors for the construction of our homes 
there may not be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by the contractors 
if the contractors quality of work is not sufficient  our ability to construct homes on the schedule we have planned would be affected 
this could result in an increase in our costs to construct homes in a timely manner  which could result in an increase in our overall costs and thus a decline in our margins and in our net income 
further  non timely completion of work could affect our ability to sell homes based upon our projected timeline thus possibly affecting our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our homebuilding efforts 
shortages of labor or materials and or increases in the price of materials could delay construction or increase the cost of home construction thereby reducing our sales and earnings 
the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages  as well as volatility in the prices of certain materials  including lumber  framing  drywall and cement  which are significant components of home construction costs 
these labor and material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing or during periods where the area in which we operate experiences natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures 
shortages and price increases could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction  which in turn could harm our operating results 
the market value of our real estate interests could decline  which may require write downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would negatively impact our results of operations 
the risk of owning developed and undeveloped land can be substantial for homebuilders 
homebuilding requires that we acquire land for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our existing and new markets 
the risks inherent in purchasing and developing land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases 
thus  we may have bought and developed land which we cannot profitably sell or on which we cannot profitably build and sell homes 
the market value of land  buildable lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions 
it is possible that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks will not be successful and as a result our operations may suffer 
in addition  inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing market 
prevailing mark et conditions may significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale 
in the event of changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell homes or land inventory at lower margins or at a loss 
furthermore  if the market conditions continue to deteriorate  we will be required to record write downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale 
such write downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may disrupt or delay construction and may impair the value of our real estate property 
severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters  such as  but not limited to  earthquakes  landslides  hurricanes  tornadoes  volcanic activity  droughts  floods  and heavy or prolonged rain  can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to delay or halt construction or to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects under construction and to unsold homes 
further  these conditions can delay home closings  adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor  or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis 
to the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events  our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 

table of contents the homebuilding industry is highly competitive and  with more limited resources than some of our competitors  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from other developers on the island of hawaii and from other luxury residential properties in hawaii and the mainland united states 
in many cases  our competitors have greater financial and other resources  more established market positions  lower costs of capital  labor and material than we do 
homebuilders compete for  among other things  desirable land  financing  raw materials  skilled labor and purchasers 
we compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors  including location  reputation  amenities  design  quality and price  with numerous homebuilders  including some homebuilders with greater financial resources and or lower costs than us 
increased competition could also reduce the number of homes we deliver  reducing our revenues  or cause us to accept reduced margins to maintain sales volumes 
a reduction in our revenue or margins due to competitive factors could affect our ability to service our debt  including the credit facilities 
risks related to contract drilling segment demand for water well drilling and or pump installation is volatile 
a decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of hawaii 
as also noted above  the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local  regional  and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates  housing demand  population growth  employment levels and job growth and property taxes 
if we experience a decrease in water well drilling and or pump installation contracts  we may experience decreased revenues and operating results 
a significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business 
a significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies 
reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services 
material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
our contract drilling operations face significant competition 
we face competition for our services from a variety of competitors 
many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor 
our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree  quality of service 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  our financial results could be adversely affected 

table of contents the loss of or damage to key vendor  customer or sub contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations 
our business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors  customers and subcontractors 
the loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business 
awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers 
although the company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining such bonds in the past  there can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past 
additionally  bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids  which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results 
the contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started 
our contracts are subject to change orders and can be cancelled and if our estimated backlog is reduced significantly  this could adversely affect our operations 
the occurrence of natural disasters in hawaii could adversely affect our business 
the occurrence of a natural disaster in hawaii such as  but not limited to  earthquakes  landslides  hurricanes  tornadoes  volcanic activity  droughts and floods  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts 
entity wide risks the continued economic slowdown may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
the ongoing economic slowdown may have further impacts on our business and our financial condition  and we may face additional challenges if economic conditions do not improve 
our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the economic situation could adversely affect the demand for real estate development activities in the state of hawaii which in turn could cause a decline in the water well drilling and or pump installation services required 
furthermore  weak market conditions could cause a deeper decrease in demand for luxury homes 
additionally  economic conditions could lead to a further reduction in demand for oil and natural gas  or lower prices for natural gas and oil  or both  wh ich could have a negative impact on our revenues 

table of contents we are reliant upon future cash flows from operations  land investment segment development rights and percentage of sales proceeds  and available credit as a source of liquidity 
if estimated cash inflows do not occur timely or are less than current expectations  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
in addition to cash flows from oil and natural gas  residential real estate and contract drilling operations  we rely upon land investment segment development rights and percentage of sales payment proceeds as a source of liquidity 
however  oil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile and the timing and amount of land investment segment percentage of sales proceeds are unpredictable  may be sporadic  and are not under our control 
development rights proceeds  on the other hand  are scheduled but there is no assurance that the final development rights option monies will be received 
we also have a credit facility with a canadian bank that is denominated in canadian dollars 
any decreases in currency exchange rates affect the amount of credit available to us 
furthermore  our real estate credit facility s loan advance limitation is subject to the underlying security s appraised value 
any decreases in the appraised value of the underlying security could result in the need to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings 
accordingly  if estimated cash inflows do not occur on a timely basis or are less than current expectations or if we are subject to reductions in available credit  our revenues  operating results  cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted 
our future level of indebtedness and the terms of our financing arrangements may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and limit our growth 
at september   we had borrowings under our credit facilities of approximately million 
in the ordinary course of business  we may incur significant additional debt  to the extent permitted by our credit facilities  in order to fund future capital expenditures  acquisitions and homebuilding activities 
the terms of our credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability and  in some cases  the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take  including one or more of the following incurring additional debt  including guarantees of indebtedness  making investments  creating liens on our assets  and selling assets 
our level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in our financing agreements could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain future financing  through equity offerings or debt financings  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  refinancing of indebtedness or general corporate and other activities  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes ie  working capital  capital expenditures  and other general business activities  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  the changes in our business  
table of contents subject us to higher costs and more restrictive covenants in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  if additional financing is obtained  make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as our credit facilities are subject to variable interest rates  detract from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally  place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors  and make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our industries  especially declines in oil and natural gas prices  and the economy in general 
we may incur additional debt  including significant secured indebtedness  or issue additional stock in order to fund capital expenditures  make future acquisitions  and develop our properties 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions  oil and natural gas prices and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need capital 
in addition  our canadian revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination 
a decrease in the facility could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base  or we may need to further secure the lenders with additional collateral 
borrowings under the real estate non revolving credit facility are subject to a loan advance limitation based on the appraised value of the underlying security 
the loan advance limitation may be reduced as a result of a decrease in appraised value of the underlying security 
if borrowings under the facility exceed the loan advance limitation  barnwell will be required to make debt repayments in the amount of the excess 
the price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including fluctuations in commodity prices  variations in results of operations  announcements by us and our competitors  legislative or regulatory changes  general trends in the industry  general market conditions  and analysts estimates and other events in the oil and natural gas industry 
failure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations 
we require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business 
in addition to competing in highly competitive industries  we compete in a highly competitive labor market 
our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market 

table of contents a small number of stockholders  including our executive officers  own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders 
as of september   two of our investors and our executive officers held approximately of our common stock 
the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders 
these stockholders  acting together  have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders  including the election of our directors  and could accelerate  delay  deter or prevent a change of control of us 
these stockholders are able to exercise significant control over our business  policies and affairs 
adverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors  or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect barnwell s results and financial condition 
retirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors  including the performance of the financial markets  specifically the equity markets  and the levels of interest rates 
we are involved as a passive minority interest partner in joint ventures and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships 
we are involved as a passive minority interest partner in joint venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects 
entering into a joint venture as a passive minority interest partner involves certain risks which include the inability to exercise voting control over the joint venture  economic or business interests which are not aligned with our venture partners  including the holding period and timing of ultimate sale of the ventures underlying assets  and the inability for the venture partner to fulfill its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties 
general economic conditions in the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial results 
we own a passive minority interest in hualalai resort  which includes the four seasons resort hualalai at historic ka upulehu  two golf courses and a clubhouse  and a passive minority interest in the kona village resort  an acre oceanfront hotel property 
soft economic conditions and reduced travel to north kona  hawaii could adversely affect these interests and  therefore  our financial results related to our investment 
the aforementioned properties are also subject to risks that generally relate to investments in commercial real estate  including governmental regulations  real estate  insurance  zoning  tax and eminent domain laws  the ongoing need for capital improvements to maintain or upgrade properties  fluctuations in real estate values  and the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to other investments

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the consolidated balance sheets of barnwell industries  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as barnwell  we  our  us or the company as of september  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  equity and comprehensive income loss  and cash flows for the years ended september  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management of barnwell to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur in periods subsequent to the period in which the estimate was made  or use of different estimates that the company could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
the most critical accounting policies inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements are described below 
we continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations 
oil and natural gas properties full cost ceiling calculation and depletion policy description we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation  on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling limitation is the sum of the discounted present value at  using average first day of the month prices during the month period ending in the reporting period on a constant basis  of barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance sheet  plus the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion  less related income tax effects 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is expensed unless subsequent market price changes eliminate or reduce the indicated write down 

table of contents judgments and assumptions the estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  historical data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
our reserve estimates are prepared annually by independent petroleum consultants and quarterly by internal personnel 
the passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the last three fiscal years  annual revisions to our reserve volume e stimates have averaged of the previous year s estimate 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  such revisions could result in a write down of oil and natural gas properties 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by at the end of fiscal  the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately  this decrease would not have resulted in a write down during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling  estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense 
the lower the estimated reserves  the higher the depletion rate per unit of production 
conversely  the higher the estimated reserves  the lower the depletion rate per unit of production 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by as of the beginning of fiscal  depletion for fiscal would have increased by approximately  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that a discount factor be used and that average first day of the month prices during the month period ending in the reporting period are held constant 
costs included in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner 
as such  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
therefore  oil and natural gas property write downs that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation as a result of fluctuations in prices  as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
impairment of real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels policy description real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
if an asset s fair value less costs to sell  based on estimated future cash flows  management estimates or market comparisons  is less than its carrying amount  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 

table of contents judgments and assumptions real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if the evaluation determines that the recorded value will not be recovered  the carrying value of real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels are written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
this evaluation requires management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments based on market conditions and comparable sales transactions 
changes in assumptions may require valuation adjustments that may materially impact the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
impairment of investments in land interests policy description investments in land interests are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
if an asset s fair value  based on estimated future cash flows  management estimates or market comparisons  is less than its carrying amount  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
judgments and assumptions investments in land interests are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset  management estimates or market comparisons are compared with the amount recorded to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset 
if the evaluation determines that the recorded value will not be recovered  our investments in land interests are written down to its estimated fair value 
this evaluation requires management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among others  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  uncertainty about future events  including changes in economic conditions  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing cost of maintenance and improvements of the assets 
changes in these and other assumptions may require valuation adjustments that may materially impact the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
impairment of investment in joint ventures policy description joint venture investments are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there is an other than temporary loss in value 
an investment is written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value which is other than temporary 
judgments and assumptions the company s investment in joint ventures is reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of a loss in value 
an investment is written down to fair value if the impairment is other than temporary 
in determining the fair value of an investment and assessing whether any identified impairment is other than temporary  significant estimates and considerable judgment are involved 
in evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary  the company considers all available information  including the length of time and extent of the impairment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the affiliate  the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a 
table of contents period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and projected industry and economic trends 
these estimates and judgments are based  in part  on the company s current and future evaluation of economic conditions  as well as a joint venture s current and future plans to the extent that such plans are known to the company 
impairment calculations contain additional uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to estimates of future cash flows  probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios  and appropriate discount rates 
changes in these and other assumptions could affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated affiliates and  accordingly  may require valuation adjustments to the company s investments that may materially impact the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
income taxes policy description income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
barnwell recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained by a taxing authority 
judgments and assumptions we make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period 
significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods 
we are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is provided 
accordingly  changes in our business performance  unforeseen events  and changes in estimates of future taxable income could require a further increase in the valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made  and the impact of these changes could be material 
in addition  barnwell operates within the us and canada and is subject to audit by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions 
barnwell records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions take n in other jurisdictions and advice 
table of contents from tax experts 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings  either of which could be material 
management believes that barnwell s provision for uncertain tax positions is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect barnwell s current and deferred income tax amounts 
asset retirement obligation policy description barnwell records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related reserves 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating expense 
judgments and assumptions the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred along with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
barnwell has estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash outflows required to settle abandonment and restoration liabilities 
the present value calculation includes numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities  the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability  what constitutes adequate restoration  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and consideration of changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
abandonment and restoration cost estimates are determined in conjunction with barnwell s reserve engineers based on historical information regarding costs incurred to ab andon and restore similar well sites  information regarding current market conditions and costs  and knowledge of subject well sites and properties 
the process of estimating the asset retirement obligation requires substantial judgment and use of estimates  resulting in imprecise determinations 
actual asset retirement obligations through the end of fiscal have not materially differed from our estimates 
however  because of the inherent imprecision of estimates as described above  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
a increase in accretion and depletion of the asset retirement obligation would have increased barnwell s fiscal expenses before taxes by approximately  contractual obligations disclosure is not required as barnwell qualifies as a smaller reporting company 
overview barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business exploring for  developing  producing and selling oil and natural gas in canada oil and natural gas segment  investing in land interests in hawaii land investment segment  developing homes for sale in hawaii residential real estate segment  and drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in hawaii contract drilling segment 

table of contents oil and natural gas segment barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short term contracts with marketers of oil 
natural gas sold by barnwell is generally sold under both long term and short term contracts with prices indexed to market prices 
the price of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers 
oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control 
market prices for oil and natural gas products are dependent upon factors such as  but not limited to  changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  changes in weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  and output 
petroleum and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly 
natural gas prices tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand  although this trend has become less pronounced due to the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning in the summer and increased natural gas storage capacity in north america 
oil and natural gas exploration  development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices  thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploring  developing and operating the oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well 
capital expenditures are required to fund the exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas 
cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary  however  a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves 
due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development  significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort

table of contents business environment our primary operations are concentrated in canada and in the state of hawaii 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by macroeconomic conditions in those areas  as well as general economic conditions of the us domestic and world economies 
current global economic conditions differentiate recent times from years past 
although signs of economic recovery appear to exist  sluggish demand continues to impact all of the company s segments in both hawaii and canada 
oil and natural gas segment our revenue  profitability  and future rate of growth are substantially dependent on existing oil and natural gas prices 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile 
oil and natural gas prices hit historic high levels in fiscal through the date of this filing  oil and natural gas prices have fallen sharply from their record levels 
natural gas prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages during the three years ended september   have ranged from a low of per thousand cubic feet the average price for the quarter ended september  to a high of per thousand cubic feet the average price for the quarter ended june  
oil prices for barnwell  based on quarterly averages for the period discussed above  ranged from a low of per barrel the average price for the quarter ended ma rch  to a high of per barrel the average price for the quarter ended june  
declines in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows 
land investment and residential real estate segments the values of the company s investment in residential parcels and real estate held for sale are impacted by development activity and real estate values in the surrounding area 
as a result of real estate sales prices and activity in the area where barnwell s investment in residential parcels and real estate held for sale are located  barnwell determined that a reduction of the carrying value of its investment in residential parcels and real estate held for sale was necessary in the year ended september  accordingly  barnwell recorded a  reduction of the carrying value of these assets during the year ended september  continued weak real estate sales activity could result in additional write downs 
kaupulehu s two luxury homes are complete and available for sale 
one home is a fully furnished bedroom  bath ranch style home and is  square feet in size 
the second home  currently unfurnished  is of similar design and is  square feet in size 
our ability to achieve our expectations regarding the sale of the completed residences and or lots held for investment is contingent upon the strength of the luxury real estate market 
actual future results could be lower than our current estimates 
barnwell will have continuing cash outflows such as debt repayments  interest  maintenance  property taxes  and other holding costs until the homes and lots are sold 
during fiscal  development work on the kaupulehu lot a area by wbkd continued with the overall landscape plan including planting of trees and other groundscape materials in various areas

results of operations summary net earnings attributable to barnwell for fiscal totaled  a  increase from a net loss of  in fiscal this increase was largely attributable to the following reductions in carrying values of assets in the prior year were   higher than the current year 
the prior year included a  reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties and  in reductions of the carrying values of barnwell s investments in joint ventures and lot acquisition rights  as compared to a  reduction of the carrying value of barnwell s investment in residential parcels and real estate held for sale in the current year  oil and natural gas segment operating profit excluding the impact of the reduction in carrying value of oil and natural gas properties discussed above increased  before taxes  primarily due to t higher prices received for oil and natural gas liquids partially offset by lower production  t lower depletion expense in large part due to the prior year s impact of the reduction in carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  and t income from third party drilling credits purchased during fiscal totaling  a  increase in land investment segment operating profits before taxes and non controlling interests share of such profits and excluding the impact of the reduction in carrying value of investment in residential parcels discussed above due to increased sales  and

general in addition to us operations  barnwell conducts foreign operations in canada 
consequently  barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the impact of fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar may be material from period to period 
barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between the canadian and us dollar 
the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar increased at september   as compared to september  accordingly  the assets  liabilities  equity and revenues and expenses of barnwell s subsidiaries operating in canada have been adjusted to reflect the change in the exchange rates 
barnwell s canadian dollar assets are greater than its canadian dollar liabilities  therefore  increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar generate other comprehensive income or loss  respectively 
other comprehensive income and losses are not included in net earnings loss 
other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  for fiscal was  a  increase from other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  of  in fiscal there was no tax on other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments in fiscal due to a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax asset 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal and and are reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

table of contents oil and natural gas revenues increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to increases in oil and natural gas liquids prices  which increased and  respectively  as compared to prices in fiscal natural gas production decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to natural declines  including at dunvegan  barnwell s principal oil and natural gas property 
gross natural gas production decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  dunvegan decreased by and all other properties decreased by 
the decreases in gross production were partially offset by lower natural gas royalties  yielding a decrease in net natural gas production of 
at dunvegan  net natural gas production remained essentially unchanged decreased  mcf or  and net natural gas production at all other properties decreased 
dunvegan contributed approximately of barnwell s net natural gas production in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  natural gas production from the dunvegan unit was responsible for approximately of barnwell s natural gas revenues  as compared to in fiscal net oil production decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due primarily to natural declines in production  higher alberta crown royalty rates due to higher oil prices  and available pipeline at one property being closed to correct for corrosion 
gross oil production decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal in  the government of alberta announced the results of its natural gas and conventional oil competitiveness review and published its policy response  energizing investment  a framework to improve alberta s natural gas and conventional oil competitiveness  which will modify alberta s royalty framework effective january  in june  the alberta government finalized the changes to the royalty framework which reduces the maximum royalty rate of for oil and natural gas production to and  respectively 
oil and natural gas operating expenses operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses  the increase was partially offset by lower workover activity and repairs at all properties and lower production

contract drilling contract drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump installation  replacement and repair in hawaii 
contract drilling revenues increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling operating expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the contract drilling segment generated a  operating profit before general and administrative expenses during fiscal  a decrease of  as compared to an operating profit before general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a unique well drilling project in fiscal that was drilled from sea level to well below sea level in an effort to obtain cold sea water which encountered unforeseen significant water intrusions and therefore increased drilling difficulties 
additionally  of drilling revenues in fiscal were on two government jobs that required the payment of wages at the higher davis bacon rate 
these impacts were partially offset by increased well drilling activity during fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents at september   there was a backlog of four well drilling contracts and pump installation and repair contracts  of which three well drilling and seven pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of september  the backlog of contract drilling revenues as of december  was approximately  all but one of the contracts in backlog at december  are expected to be completed within fiscal year contract drilling revenues and costs are not seasonal in nature but can fluctuate significantly based on the awarding and timing of contracts  which are determined by contract drilling customer demand 
gas processing and other gas processing and other income increased  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  of the increase was attributable to third party drilling credits purchased by the oil and natural gas segment during fiscal the canadian province of alberta provides a drilling credit based on a fixed dollar amount per meter drilled to eligible companies which drill new conventional oil and natural gas wells on alberta crown lands 
certain companies have drilling credits which are in excess of a formulaic maximum based upon royalties paid  which results in such companies being unable to fully claim their drilling credits 
other companies who have had limited drilling activity have earned drilling credits that are cumulatively less than the formulaic maximum 
barnwell successfully acquired drilling credits for less than par value from an entity that had drilling credits in excess of its formulaic maximum  therefore barnwell realized a gain of  the increase related to the drilling credit was partially offset by a decrease due to a  refund of unused gas contract management funds from a natural gas marketer received in fiscal there was no such refund in fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to i a  increase in expenses incurred by the residential real estate segment and joint venture investments due to ongoing holding and maintenance costs  ii a  increase in stock appreciation rights expense due to fluctuations in barnwell s stock price as well as the granting of new awards and incremental vesting of outstanding awards  and iii a  increase due to a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
the increase was partially offset by a  decrease in compensation costs 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  due to a decrease in the depletion rate resulting from the fiscal reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties and an decrease in net production in mcfe 
the decrease was partially offset by a increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 

table of contents reduction of carrying value of assets during fiscal years and  barnwell reduced the carrying value of certain assets 
a breakdown of the reduction of the carrying value of assets as reported in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows year ended september  investment in residential parcels real estate held for sale lot acquisition rights mauka lands investment in joint ventures oil and natural gas properties total reduction of carrying value of assets as a result of real estate sales prices and activity in the area where barnwell s investment in residential parcels and real estate held for sale are located  barnwell determined that a reduction of the carrying value of its investment in residential parcels and real estate held for sale was necessary in the year ended september  accordingly  barnwell recorded a  reduction of the carrying value of these assets during the year ended september  no reduction was necessary during fiscal under the full cost method of accounting  we are required to perform quarterly ceiling test calculations 
due to a significant decline in prices  barnwell s net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling limitation at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal as such  barnwell reduced the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties by  during the year ended september  no such reduction was necessary during fiscal during the year ended september   barnwell determined that a  reduction of the carrying value of its lot acquisition rights in the mauka lands was necessary as a result of widespread impacts of the economic recession and tightened credit markets 
additionally  barnwell recorded a  non cash reduction in the carrying value of its investment in joint ventures during the year ended september  due to declines in values that are deemed other than temporary 
no such reductions were necessary during fiscal bad debt expense net bad debt expense of  in fiscal primarily reflects a provision for doubtful accounts due to uncertainty regarding the collectability of a receivable from a customer experiencing difficulties as a result of the financial and economic crisis 
there was no bad debt expense during fiscal interest expense interest expense increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to the fact that no interest was capitalized during fiscal as development of the residential homes was completed in fiscal also contributing to the increase in interest expense were higher average interest rates and higher loan commitment fee expenses 

table of contents interest costs for the fiscal years ended september  and are summarized as follows year ended september  interest costs incurred less interest costs capitalized interest expense the majority of barnwell s debt is denominated in us dollars 
therefore  the increase in the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar had a minimal impact on interest expense 
income taxes included in the income tax provision for fiscal is an approximately  benefit from a change in tax law enacted in november which expands the number of years barnwell can carry back us federal income tax losses 
there was no such benefit in the prior year 
partially offsetting the  benefit was a  increase in income tax expense due to an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
included in the income tax benefit for fiscal is a  non cash charge to income tax expense resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
net earnings attributable to non controlling interests earnings and losses attributable to non controlling interests represent the non controlling interests share of revenues and expenses related to the various partnerships and joint ventures in which barnwell has interests 
net earnings attributable to non controlling interests increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to a net loss attributable to non controlling interests of  in fiscal  primarily due to impacts to non controlling interests of higher revenues reported by the land investment segment 
the increase was partially offset by higher write downs of barnwell s assets impacting non controlling interests in fiscal as compared to fiscal environmental matters federal  state  and canadian governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply  particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business 
these laws  rules and regulations affect the operations of barnwell and could have a material adverse effect upon the earnings or competitive position of barnwell 
although barnwell s experience has been to the contrary  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case 

table of contents inflation the effect of inflation on barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations  interest cost as a substantial portion of barnwell s debt is at variable short term rates of interest which tend to increase as inflation increases  general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas prices realized by barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western canadian midwestern us prices for natural gas 
impact of recently issued accounting standards on future filings none 
liquidity and capital resources barnwell s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flows from operations  land investment segment proceeds and available credit 
at september   barnwell had  in cash and cash equivalents   in working capital  and approximately  of available credit under its credit facility with its canadian bank 
barnwell s future liquidity and ability to fund capital expenditures is dependent upon operating cash flows  existing working capital  available credit under its credit facility with its canadian bank  and its ability to access debt and equity markets 
cash flows cash flows provided by operations totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  of cash flows used in operations for the same period in fiscal the  change was primarily due to a decrease in residential real estate home development costs  increased oil and natural gas segment profits  and changes in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  of cash flows used in investing activities for the same period in fiscal the  change was primarily attributable to a  increase in proceeds from land investment segment sales and a  decrease in capital expenditures due to lower oil and natural gas capital expenditures partially offset by the acquisition of a drilling rig by the contract drilling segment 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  of cash flows provided by financing activities for fiscal the  change was primarily due to  in debt repayments in fiscal as compared to net long term borrowings of  in fiscal credit arrangements barnwell s credit facility at royal bank of canada  a canadian bank  was renewed in april for  canadian dollars  unchanged from the prior year amount  or approximately us  at the september  exchange rate

if oil and natural gas prices and production  land investment segment proceeds  and residential real estate home sales are less than current expectations  we will be faced with reduced operating cash flows which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition 
in addition  we cannot predict whether barnwell s canadian revolving credit facility will be reduced below the current level of borrowings under the facility upon the april nb sp  review or whether our real estate credit facility will be reduced below borrowed amounts in the event of declines in the appraised values of the underlying security  which would require us to repay a portion of our loan borrowings earlier than anticipated 
in the event our capital resources are not sufficient to fund our future cash needs  the company will need to obtain alternative terms or sources of financing or liquidate investments and or operating assets to make any required cash outflows 
events and circumstances that lead to results that significantly differ from management s expectations could have a material adverse effect on our operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition
