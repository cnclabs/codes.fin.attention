item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the selected financial data in item and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all financial and operating data presented in items and reflects the continuing operations of our business for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated 
overview we are a healthcare services company that through our subsidiaries operates hospitals  nursing and rehabilitation centers and a contract rehabilitation services business across the united states 
at december   our hospital division operated ltac hospitals with  licensed beds in states 
our health services division operated nursing and rehabilitation centers with  licensed beds in states 
we also operated a contract rehabilitation services business that provides rehabilitative services primarily in long term care settings 
on july   we completed the spin off transaction 
see item business general spin off transaction and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in recent years  we have completed several strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results 
for accounting purposes  the operating results of these businesses and the losses or impairments associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
assets not sold at december  have been measured at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs of disposal and have been classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of acquired businesses have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to each of our operating divisions 
these payment arrangements may be based upon prospective rates  reimbursable costs  established charges  discounted charges or per diem payments 
net patient service revenue is recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from medicare  medicaid  medicare advantage  other third party payors and individual patients for services rendered 
retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements 
we recorded income of approximately million in related to the favorable settlement of a prior year nursing center medicaid cost report dispute 
favorable settlements of prior year hospital medicare cost reports aggregated million in 
table of contents during  we also recorded a pretax credit of approximately million to reflect a change in estimate for hospital medicare accounts receivable and a pretax credit of approximately million to adjust certain nursing center medicaid revenues 
a summary of revenues by payor type follows in thousands year ended december  medicare medicaid medicare advantage other eliminations rehabilitation pharmacy collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients and customers 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million for  million for and million for during  we recorded a million charge for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable acquired in a hospital acquisition in a prior year 
allowances for insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks and workers compensation risks through our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for these risks are based upon management s best available information including actuarially determined estimates 
the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts recorded 
to the extent that expected ultimate claims costs vary from historical provisions for loss  future earnings will be charged or credited 
provisions for loss for professional liability risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary have been discounted based upon actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns using a discount rate of for the 
table of contents policy year  for the policy year and for all prior policy years 
the discount rates are based upon the risk free interest rate for the respective year 
amounts equal to the discounted loss provision are funded annually 
we do not fund the portion of professional liability risks related to estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
accordingly  these liabilities are not discounted 
the allowance for professional liability risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  if we did not discount any of the allowances for professional liability risks  these balances would have approximated million at december  and million at december  as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received distributions of million in  million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary in accordance with applicable regulations 
these distributions had no impact on earnings and the proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
for example  a variance in the allowance for professional liability risks at december  would impact our operating income by approximately million 
the provision for professional liability risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for changes in estimates for prior year professional liability costs reduced professional liability costs by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
with respect to our discontinued operations  we recorded favorable pretax adjustments of million in and million in  and a pretax charge aggregating million in resulting from changes in estimates for professional liability reserves related to prior years 
provisions for loss for workers compensation risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary are not discounted and amounts equal to the loss provision are funded annually 
the allowance for workers compensation risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  the provision for workers compensation risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our annual reported income or loss for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  we paid approximately million of employer payroll taxes related to a settlement reached with the irs for all disputed federal income tax issues for fiscal and 
table of contents our effective income tax rate was in  in and in we recorded favorable income tax adjustments related to the resolution of state income tax contingencies from prior years that reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately million in each of  and the effective income tax rate in was negatively impacted by million of non deductible expenses associated with the spin off transaction 
we adopted the provisions of the authoritative guidance related to the uncertainty in income taxes on january  the adoption did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there are significant uncertainties with respect to capital loss carryforwards that could affect materially the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized and a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent that it is uncertain that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we recognized net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  and million at december  we identified deferred income tax assets for state income tax nols of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a corresponding deferred income tax valuation allowance of million at december  and for that portion of the net deferred income tax assets that were not realizable 
after our emergence from bankruptcy in  the realization of pre reorganization deferred tax assets and the resolution of certain income tax contingencies eliminated in full the goodwill recorded in connection with fresh start accounting 
after the fresh start accounting goodwill was eliminated in full  the excess of approximately million in and million in was treated as an increase to capital in excess of par value and a reduction in the pre emergence deferred tax valuation allowance and pre emergence income tax liability 
following the adoption of the revised provisions for accounting for business combinations on january   future adjustments to pre emergence unrecognized income tax benefits will be recorded to earnings 
we are subject to various federal and state income tax audits in the ordinary course of business 
such audits could result in increased tax payments  interest and penalties 
while we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we cannot assure you that the various authorities engaged in the examination of our income tax returns will not challenge our positions 
we record accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest related to uncertain tax provisions totaled million as of december  and million as of december  to the extent the unrecognized income tax benefits become realized or the related accrued interest is no longer necessary  our provision for income taxes would be favorably impacted 
the amount  if recognized  that would favorably impact our results of operations approximates million 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for tax years through we are currently under irs examination for fiscal years and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
state jurisdictions generally have statutes of limitations for tax returns ranging from three to five years 
the state impact of federal income tax changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states 
we currently have various state income tax returns under examination 

table of contents during  the statute of limitations associated with certain state income tax filing positions will expire and may decrease the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits 
a reduction in our income tax liability of approximately million to million for unrecognized income tax benefits is reasonably possible and may favorably impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and identifiable finite lived intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate an impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest that the recorded amounts cannot be recovered based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 
in assessing the carrying values of long lived assets  we estimate future cash flows at the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
for this purpose  these cash flows are aggregated based upon the contractual agreements underlying the operation of the facility or group of facilities 
generally  an individual facility is considered the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
however  to the extent that groups of facilities are leased under a master lease agreement in which the operations of a facility and compliance with the lease terms are interdependent upon other facilities in the agreement including our ability to renew the lease or divest a particular property  we define the group of facilities under a master lease agreement as the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated cash flows of all facilities within a master lease agreement are aggregated for purposes of evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets 
our other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform an impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
also  during and the fourth quarter of  the market value of our common stock was below our book equity value 
management believes that the difference between our market equity value and our book equity value during was generally attributable to uncertainty in the equity markets related to proposed federal healthcare reform legislation and medicare revenue reductions announced by cms during the year 
the decline in was generally attributable to our announcement of weaker than expected third quarter operating results particularly in our hospital division and the related reduction in our earnings outlook in the fourth quarter of and fiscal as compared to investor expectations 
in addition  the weak global economic conditions that negatively impacted the condition of the debt and equity markets in may have contributed to the decline in the market value of our common stock 
the difference between the book equity value and the market value of our common stock during and the fourth quarter of was a potential indication that the carrying value of our goodwill may have been impaired but was not viewed as a triggering event 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test at the end of each fiscal year for each of our reporting units 
a reporting unit is either an operating segment or one level below the operating segment  referred to as a component 
when the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics  we aggregate the components of our operating segments into one reporting unit 
accordingly  we have determined 
table of contents that our reporting units are hospitals  health services  rehabilitation services and hospice 
the carrying value of goodwill for each of our reporting units at december  and were as follows in thousands december  hospitals health services rehabilitation services hospice the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
based upon the results of the step one impairment test for goodwill and the impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets in each of the last three years  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with our annual impairment tests 
since quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  we applied judgment in determining the fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
we relied on widely accepted valuation techniques  including equally weighted discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses approaches  which capture both the future income potential of the reporting unit and the market behaviors and actions of market participants in the industry that includes the reporting unit 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry specific economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the discounted cash flow approach uses a projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital 
under the discounted cash flow approach  the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period for each reporting unit including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
the market multiple analysis estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating results 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting units 
our analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book equity value 
our conclusions were supported by both quantitative and qualitative factors  including the estimate of an implied control premium for acquisitions in our industry  our fourth quarter operating results that exceeded investment analyst expectations and consideration of our updated business expectations at december  and we do not believe that any of our reporting units were at risk for failing the step one impairment test at december  the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily hospital certificates of need  are estimated using an excess earnings method  a form of discounted cash flows  which is based upon the concept that net after tax cash flows provide a return supporting all of the assets of a business enterprise 
the carrying value of the our certificates of need at december  was million 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets are derived from projections at a facility level which include management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in the number of admissions  patient days  reimbursement rates  operating costs  rent expense and capital expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  changes in working capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital 
at december   the fair value of our certificates of need intangible assets exceeded its carrying value 
we do not believe that any of our certificates of need were at risk for failing the impairment test at december  
table of contents although we have determined that there was no goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairments as of december   adverse changes in the operating environment and related key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets or declines in the value of our common stock may result in future impairment charges for a portion or all of these assets 
specifically  if the rate of growth of government and commercial revenues earned by our reporting units were to be less than projected or if proposed healthcare reforms were to negatively impact our business  an impairment charge for a portion or all of the assets may be required 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations  but would not be expected to have an impact on our cash flows or liquidity 
recently issued accounting requirements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the provisions of the guidance require new disclosures related to transfers in and out of levels and as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provisions also require a reconciliation of the activity in level as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements recurring fair value measurements 
existing disclosures also were expanded to include level fair value measurement valuation techniques and inputs 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures for level activity which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in august  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the provisions of this guidance clarify how an entity should measure liabilities at fair value 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after august  the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance related to the consolidation criteria for variable interest entities vie 
the guidance  among other things  requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  enhances disclosures regarding an enterprise s involvement with a vie  and amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie 
under the guidance  a vie must be consolidated if the enterprise has both a the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the guidance will be effective as of the beginning of an enterprise s first fiscal year beginning after november   and for interim periods within that first period  with earlier adoption prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the effect of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for establishment of the fasb codification  which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the fasb codification is the sole source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb 
the guidance is effective for all financial statements issued for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  the application of this guidance or the fasb codification did not have an impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the new provisions provide guidance related to the disclosure date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and whether such date represents the date the financial statements were 
table of contents issued or were available to be issued 
in february  the fasb issued an amendment  effective february   to remove the requirement for a filer to disclose a date in its financial statements 
the adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in april  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and the recognition of other than temporary impairments of financial instruments 
the new provisions provide guidance to determine whether the market for a security is inactive and whether transactions in inactive markets are distressed and clarify the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities 
authoritative guidance also was issued for interim disclosures regarding fair value of financial instruments  which requires an entity to provide disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in both interim and annual financial statements 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which requires that unvested restricted stock that entitles the holder to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting be included as a participating security in the basic and diluted earnings per common share calculation pursuant to the two class method 
the adoption of the guidance has been applied retrospectively in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and did not have a material impact on our earnings per common share calculations 
in december  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for business combinations  including  among other changes  new accounting concepts in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  recording the fair value of contingent considerations and contingencies at the acquisition date and expensing acquisition and restructuring costs 
the guidance is applied prospectively and is effective for business combinations which occur during fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of the guidance on january  did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity at december  or for the year ended december  however  any future business combinations may significantly impact our financial position and results of operations when compared to acquisitions accounted for under the previous guidance and may result in generally lower earnings due to the expensing of acquisition and restructuring costs 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  which will amend the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
the guidance is effective for all business combinations which occur during fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of the guidance retroactive to january  did not have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
impact of medicare and medicaid reimbursement we depend on reimbursement from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  for a substantial portion of our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues before eliminations from the medicare and medicaid programs and the balance from other third party payors  such as commercial insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and contracted providers 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes

table of contents the year in review fiscal was a year of solid operational and financial performance despite a number of reimbursement and other external challenges 
our financial results further reinforce and support our fundamental management philosophy if we take care of our people and focus on quality and customer service  our business results will follow 
financial highlights of the year included revenue gains in each of our three operating divisions hospitals  health services and peoplefirst rehabilitation 
overall revenues of billion were ahead of last year  volume growth continued to be a major operational focus for each of our divisions  with hospital admissions rising  nursing center admissions growing and rehabilitation therapy minutes increasing compared to fiscal  consolidated operating income rose to million in despite significant medicare and medicaid reimbursement reductions that negatively impacted our revenues by approximately million during the year  income from continuing operations totaled million  up over  diluted earnings per share rose to in compared to last year  operating cash flows rose to million  the highest level in three years  routine capital expenditures declined to million in  while development capital expenditures grew to million  all routine and development capital expenditures in both and were financed through internal sources  our accounts receivable days outstanding declined in  while our revolving credit borrowings  net of excess cash  declined nearly million  and the remaining unused capacity under our revolving credit facility totaled million at the end of the year  providing significant financial flexibility to pursue other growth opportunities 
our hospital division reported solid admissions growth in with particularly strong growth in non government admissions 
we continued to make progress in educating our referral sources on the value of our hospital services from both a clinical and financial perspective 
in addition  we are expanding our service lines to further promote the value of our hospitals  diversify our patient population and take advantage of unused hospital capacity 
for example  at december   we operated seven hospital based sub acute units comprising licensed beds and have plans to add another five hospital based sub acute units in key markets over the next two years 
despite a mid year medicare rate cut  we managed to increase our hospital operating income by to million in primarily as a result of growth in non government admissions and operational improvements in certain newer facilities 
in our health services division  we have made the necessary investments in leadership  clinical resources and information systems to bring a higher level of operational consistency and stability to this business 
despite strong admissions growth  our operating results reflected a more difficult government reimbursement environment with respect to both the medicare and medicaid programs 
as a result  our health services division operating income declined to million in nevertheless  we continued to enhance our asset base through the continued development of our transitional care centers and units in selected markets that contain the physical plant  clinical programs and professional staff necessary to attract higher acuity patients who require more extensive services including rehabilitation therapy 

table of contents peoplefirst rehabilitation reported an outstanding year in  with improvements in several of the operational and financial measures we use to manage our business 
strong growth in average revenues per site of service  improved therapist productivity and a renewed commitment to differentiate our brand in the markets we serve resulted in growth in peoplefirst operating income to million in in addition  growth in peoplefirst operating income contributed significantly to the consolidated net income growth we reported for the year 
we also have made great progress over the past few years in the recruitment  retention and development of our people 
our investments in employee orientation  continuing clinical education  leadership development and employee recognition programs have helped to make kindred an employer of choice in many of our local markets 
our employee turnover percentages  a leading indicator in our business  improved significantly in in each of our three operating divisions 
our commitment to our employees is the key driver in our ongoing efforts to improve clinical quality and customer service in each market we serve 
during  we continued to measure our progress in such critical areas as ventilator pneumonia rates and blood stream infection rates as well as improvements in functional outcomes of rehabilitation therapy patients discharged from our care 
we also monitor our nursing center standard survey results against our peer companies and competitors in our local markets to identify ways to improve our clinical operations and enhance our services 
we continued to pursue our organic development and external growth strategies in our key markets 
in the near term  we are developing five new hospitals  five hospital based sub acute units and to additional transitional care centers and units in selected nursing centers that will provide additional growth in each of our operating divisions 
for  we expect that our routine and development capital expenditures will range from million to million  a significant portion of which will be financed through internal sources 
our focus on the quality of care provided to our patients and residents  our commitment to taking care of our employees and our efforts to effectively use and preserve our capital resources have positioned us as a leading provider of post acute services 
we are in a position to effectively respond to a challenging economic  political and regulatory environment in order to deliver high quality care to our patients and residents  produce a valuable work experience for our employees and provide profitability to our shareholders 
hospital division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion 
during each of the past two years  revenue growth was primarily a result of increases in admissions  ongoing development of new hospitals and reimbursement rate increases associated with higher average patient acuity levels 
aggregate admissions increased in and in on a same facility basis  aggregate admissions rose in and in  while non government same facility admissions increased and  respectively 
hospital operating margins operating income as a percentage of revenues were essentially unchanged in as compared to the decline in was primarily due to growth in wage and benefit costs and growth in ancillary costs  which exceeded overall revenue growth 
hospital wage and benefit costs increased to million in and increased to million in compared to million in average hourly wage rates grew in and in employee benefit costs increased in and in  primarily as a result of increased employee health insurance costs 
professional liability costs were million in  million in and million in the increase in professional liability costs in resulted primarily from greater levels of prior year favorable adjustments recorded in and resulting from changes in estimates 

table of contents health services division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion 
revenue growth in each of the past two years was primarily attributable to reimbursement rate increases that reflected both inflationary adjustments and higher patient case mix due to increased acuity for the patients served 
revenues for included pretax income of approximately million related to the favorable settlement of a prior year nursing center medicaid cost report dispute 
on a same facility basis  nursing center admissions increased in and in compared to prior periods 
on a same facility basis  aggregate patient days declined in and were relatively unchanged in compared to prior periods 
same facility medicare patient days declined in and in same facility non government patient days increased in and in nursing center operating margins declined in as growth in labor  ancillary services costs and professional liability costs exceeded revenue growth 
nursing center operating margins in improved primarily due to same facility growth in managed care volumes  the favorable impact of acquired nursing centers and reductions in professional liability costs 
nursing center wage and benefit costs increased to billion in and increased to billion in compared to billion in average hourly wage rates increased in and in employee benefit costs increased in and in  primarily as a result of increased employee health insurance costs 
professional liability costs were million in  million in and million in the increase in professional liability costs in resulted primarily from greater levels of prior year favorable adjustments recorded in and resulting from changes in estimates 
rehabilitation division revenues increased to million in and to million in the increase in revenues in both periods was primarily attributable to growth in the volume of services provided to existing customers and  in  growth in the number of contracts 
revenues derived from non affiliated customers aggregated million in  million in and million in operating margins in increased primarily due to improvements in therapist productivity levels and the volume of services provided to existing customers 
despite growth in volumes and revenues in  operating margins declined in primarily due to wage pressures and start up costs associated with external customer growth 
pharmacy division the spin off transaction was completed on july  as a result  our consolidated operating results for included the results of our former pharmacy division for seven months 
for accounting purposes  our former pharmacy division was not treated as a discontinued operation in our historical consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
corporate overhead operating income for our operating divisions excludes allocations of corporate overhead 
these costs aggregated million in  million in and million in as a percentage of consolidated revenues  corporate overhead totaled in  in and in corporate overhead in included million of costs associated with the spin off transaction 
we recorded approximately million  million and million in other income in  and  respectively  related to the information systems and transition services agreements with pharmerica 

table of contents corporate expenses included the operating losses from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary of million in and million in each of and capital costs rent expense increased to million in and was relatively unchanged at million in the increase in rent expense in resulted primarily from contractual inflation and contingent rent increases 
rent expense in was favorably impacted by the purchase of previously leased facilities in and and the elimination of pharmacy division rents in connection with the spin off transaction 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in both years was primarily a result of our ongoing capital expenditure program and hospital development projects 
interest expense aggregated million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in and was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and lower borrowing levels under our revolving credit facility compared to the previous year 
investment income related primarily to our insurance subsidiary investments totaled million in compared to million in and million in investment income was negatively impacted in and by declining investment yields and by pretax other than temporary impairments of investments of approximately million and million  respectively  held in our insurance subsidiary investment portfolio

other information effects of inflation and changing prices we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
congress and certain state legislatures have enacted or may enact additional significant cost containment measures limiting our ability to recover our cost increases through increased pricing of our healthcare services 
medicare revenues in ltac hospitals and nursing centers are subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted annually for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
congress and the white house administration are currently considering healthcare reform bills  which would initiate significant reforms to the united states healthcare system  including potential material changes to the delivery of healthcare services and the reimbursement paid for such services by the government or other third party payors 
the house of representatives has passed a healthcare reform bill entitled the affordable healthcare for america act and the senate has passed a healthcare reform bill entitled the patient protection and affordable care act 
at this time  we cannot predict if or when one of these bills or similar legislation may be passed and submitted to the president 
the healthcare reforms contained in these bills would impact each of our businesses in some manner 
due to the unsettled nature of the current healthcare reform bills  the substantial regulatory changes that would need to be implemented by cms and others  and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms  we cannot predict which healthcare reforms will be implemented at the federal or state level  the timing of any such reforms  or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business 
several of the proposed reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services  the methods of payment for our services and the underlying regulatory environment 
the proposed reforms could include modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment  bundling payments to cover both acute and post acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers 
in addition  a primary goal of healthcare reform is to reduce costs which could include reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers 
moreover  healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies  other third party payors  our customers  as well as other healthcare providers  which may in turn negatively impact our business 
as such  these healthcare reforms or other similar healthcare reforms  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we believe that our operating margins may continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses  particularly professional liability  labor and employee benefits costs  exceeds payment increases from third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited
