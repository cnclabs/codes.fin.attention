item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal we recorded a net loss of million 
this loss included million in impairment charges to goodwill and our erp system 
net of these non cash charges our after tax net income would have been  on revenues of million compared to million in fiscal on revenues of million 
these declines primarily reflect two factors difficult macro economic conditions which depressed capital spending  and uncertainty concerning the nortel product line created by nortel s bankruptcy filing in january in response to the difficult market conditions experienced throughout fiscal  management developed and executed a cost reduction plan designed to aggressively reduce costs while preserving the key resources necessary to fully realize growth opportunities as the market recovers 
underlying the plan was management s belief that the challenging economic environment will present growth opportunities in our service business as customers choose to maintain rather than replace their existing communication systems 
in addition we anticipate customers in all segments will give stronger consideration to outsourcing the support of their communications networks to reduce costs 
to support these trends  management focused cost reduction on elements of our operations that would not affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers in these areas 
increasing our recurring revenues through both direct and wholesale services offerings is one of our key strategies 
we continue to invest in this area of our business and expect improved growth rates in fiscal based on three factors a modest economic recovery will likely create a more favorable overall marketplace  disruption in the market created by avaya s acquisition of nortel should create opportunities to increase our base of nortel repair and maintenance revenues  and the growing trend of end users to outsource additional elements of their communications services should create growth opportunities to provide managed services to new customers 
macro economic conditions negatively impacted our commercial systems business beginning in the first quarter of fiscal those conditions worsened significantly in the third fiscal quarter 
also  uncertainty regarding the ultimate disposition of the nortel product line grew as nortel began divesting its assets  including assets which are strategic to the company s operations 
finally  the company s sustained decline in market capitalization continued  reflecting market uncertainty regarding the value of the company s operations 
this combination of factors prompted the company to conduct an interim test for impairment as of july  the company engaged a consultant to assist in the valuation of the commercial systems sales and services reporting units 
the company used a combination of evaluations to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  including the following a an income approach by which forecasted future cash flows are discounted to present value  b a market approach by which comparable companies values are compared to the applicable reporting unit s values  and c a market approach by which the company s own market capitalization is applied to the applicable reporting unit 
based on the results of this work  the company determined that the carrying value of the commercial systems sales reporting unit was impaired  and the services reporting unit was not impaired 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million against its commercial systems sales reporting unit as an initial estimate at the end of the third quarter 
the company completed its evaluation of the fair value of this reporting unit including performing the step ii analysis required by asc during the fourth quarter and increased the total goodwill impairment charge to million 
also  in the third quarter of fiscal  management determined that its oracle enterprise resource planning erp system and the related investment were over adequate for its current and near term operating needs 
the erp system was originally purchased in during a period of hyper growth and the company expected to be significantly larger within three to five years 
those growth expectations did not materialize 
furthermore  the economic downturn presented another setback to the company s growth 
as a result  management determined that it was likely the investment in the erp system would not be realized within a reasonable time frame and was therefore impaired 
at the time of the impairment charge  the net book value of company s erp system was million 
the company used various outside sources and its current vendor to estimate the cost of a replacement erp system adequate for the company s current and near term operating needs 
this research yielded an estimated replacement cost of million 
as a result of this finding an impairment charge of million was recorded in the third fiscal quarter of the year 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends that affected our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
the net loss for fiscal was million compared to net income of million in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal services revenues 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
this decline reflects a or  decrease in maintenance and repair revenues  a or million decrease in implementation revenues  and a or  decrease in structured cabling revenues 
the decreases in our maintenance and repair services business  which includes revenues earned from maintenance contracts and time and materials t m charges  consisted of relatively flat contract maintenance revenues and a decrease in t m revenues of 
we believe the decline in t m revenues was primarily influenced by general economic conditions as customers reduced spending on non critical services 
contract revenues in fiscal were lower than expected because of several contract losses and a reduction in the size of one major wholesale services program 
these reductions offset program wins with other customers 
in each case  the loss of revenues was due to divestures of assets or strategic changes by end users that moved the services to other vendors 
we did not experience a significant program loss or reduction due to service quality 
our efforts to increase services revenues center on our wholesale services offerings 
under these offerings we partner with manufacturers  network services companies  and systems integrators to provide a variety of technical services to our partners end user customers 
we have invested heavily in sales and technical resources to create relationships with current and potential wholesale partners 
once those relationships are established  we jointly market our capabilities with our partners to end users who have requested bids for new services or are renewing existing contracts 
the wholesale services segment is a highly competitive market and end users because of their size and prominence can demand both favorable pricing and high service levels 
in most cases  our service performance is measured monthly  quarterly and or annually by our partner 
to date  our service ratings have been excellent 
however  our experience indicates that end users expect excellent service ratings  and pricing drives most purchase decisions 
as a result  we have limited influence in contract negotiations between our wholesale partners and end users 
this is a key difference between the direct and wholesale services offerings 
as we experienced in fiscal  growth in our wholesale services business will likely be choppy and include large contract wins that are partially offset by the occasional loss of a large wholesale services contract 
the decrease in our implementation revenues in fiscal reflects the difficult comparison to fiscal which provided over million in implementation revenues associated with the miami dade county public school s m dcps orders 
the rate of decline in these revenues was lower than the corresponding rate of decline in systems sales  traditionally the primary driver of these revenues 
we attribute this to increasing demand for more complex communications systems requiring significant fee generating design and engineering services provided by our professional services organization pso 
in the near term implementation revenues will continue to closely align with the sale of new systems 
from a long term perspective  however  as customers displace conventional communications platforms and adopt more complex systems  we anticipate growth in this area of our business through fee based utilization of these highly skilled technical resources 
our structured cabling revenues decreased in fiscal this decline is a difficult comparison to our structured cabling revenues in fiscal due to the significant contribution to these revenues by the m dcps orders 
systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a decrease compared to fiscal sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sales of systems to commercial customers is primarily attributable to the completion of the m dcps contract which produced million in equipment revenues during fiscal compared to million during fiscal additionally  macro economic conditions and uncertainty around the nortel bankruptcy dampened capital spending on technology 
the increased sales of systems to hospitality customers in fiscal reflects our continued success in this relatively mature niche market despite considerable economic challenges in the hospitality segment 
in addition  our success confirms successful execution on our strategy to expand into the mitel product offering 
mitel has provided us with the opportunity to work with hotel chains and property management companies that have previously standardized on the mitel product line 
mitel provides us the opportunity to approach existing customers about opportunities in other hospitality segments requiring a lower price point 
other revenues 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other revenues consist of commissions earned on the sale of avaya maintenance contracts and sales of equipment and or services made outside of our normal provisioning processes 
the decrease in other revenues is attributable to a decrease in the sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts 
under our dealer agreement with avaya  we are incentivized to market their maintenance contracts to the avaya customer base 
we are paid a commission on these contracts based on the size and length of the contract and the underlying equipment covered under the agreement 
we expected a decline in this segment as we benefited throughout when many customers accelerated their purchases or renewals of avaya service contracts in anticipation of manufacturer driven changes in the structure of these service programs 
this is an unpredictable revenue stream that depends on the expiration dates of existing contracts  installation dates of new systems  the customer type as defined by avaya  and the number of years that customers contract for services 
while no assurance can be given  we expect sales of avaya service contracts to return to pre fiscal levels 
sales of products provisioned outside of our normal processes generally reflects sales of phone sets to hospitality customers in which we earn a small  flat  per phone profit on the transaction 
other revenues also include restocking fees earned on canceled orders 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins earned on services revenues reflect mixed results between improved margins earned on maintenance and repair services and structured cabling  which were offset by lower margins on implementations 
as a result of improved cost controls  revised procedures  and reduced headcounts  we earned higher gross margins on our maintenance and repair and structured cabling services revenues 
implementation gross margins were impacted by the significant decline in revenues related to the m dcps contract 
however cost reductions and on boarding the new samsung service program dampened the impact of lower revenues in this area 
similar to the samsung program  developing additional billable consulting services that are not directly associated with new system installations is an important aspect of our services strategy to create more predictability and higher gross margins in this area 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal these margins are slightly higher than our expectations and reflect our continued focus on systems sales margins through controls around contract acceptance and margin reviews 
we also work closely with our manufacturers and distributors to maximize vendor support through rebate  promotion  and competitive discount programs 
these programs have been relatively unchanged allowing us to maximize these discounts and rebates 
the systems sales market is highly competitive and downward pressure on margins is a constant in this segment of our business 
we believe that the techniques and disciplines we employ around contract acceptance and margin reviews will enable us to maintain our gross margins on systems sales 
however  we can give no assurance regarding possible changes in our vendor support programs or other market factors that could either increase or lower margins 
a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues 
these include costs incurred to market and administer the avaya post warranty maintenance contracts that we sell and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
while we earn a commission on the sale of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts which has no direct cost of goods sold  we incur costs in marketing and administration of these contracts before submitting them to avaya 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics  warehousing  advance replacement of service spare parts  and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold was of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses  including million in impairment charges  were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal excluding the impairment charges  operating expenses were of revenues in fiscal apart from the impairment  the increase in operating expenses reflects the following factors a bad debt provision of  in specific response to the nortel bankruptcy filing increased legal fees to support litigation and board governance activities increased amortization of the erp system platform prior to the impairment entry made in the third fiscal quarter  and intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions of service contracts and customer lists the level of operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is above our targets and we took steps in the third quarter to bring these costs more in line with our expectations 
these steps included reductions of our sales force and sales support staffs  a company wide suspension of the matching contribution on our k plan  and a mandatory week of unpaid leave for each employee in the company during the last months of the fiscal year 
although rapidly declining systems sales make it difficult to meet our targets for operating expenses as a percent of revenues  we consider it tactically appropriate  given our strong cash flows  to support operating expenses above our targets in the near term so we are positioned for faster than market growth when economic conditions improve 
interest expense and other income 
interest expense consists primarily of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this reduction reflects both lower interest rates and lower average borrowing during the year 
the cash cycle on the m dcps project was extremely long and forced us to borrow heavily on our revolving line of credit in fiscal to meet working capital needs 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  in fiscal tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal and fiscal this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net loss as a percent of revenues in fiscal was a negative 
excluding the impact of the non cash impairment charges in fiscal  our net income as a percentage of revenues was compared to net income as a percent of revenues of in fiscal this decrease reflects relatively flat operating expenses on decreased revenues in fiscal our current business model targets an operating margin of to to be reached in the next three to five years 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  continued improvements in total gross margins  primarily in our service gross margins  and a significantly slower growth rate in operating expenses to meet this target 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal services revenues 
revenues earned from our services business were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
this growth reflects a or million increase in maintenance and repair services revenues  a or million increase in implementation revenues  and a or  increase in structured cabling revenues 
the increases in our maintenance and repair services consisted of growth in our contract maintenance revenues of  partially offset by lower t m revenues of 
the growth rate in contract revenues in fiscal was lower than expected due to lower growth in commercial contract revenues 
the growth in our implementation revenues in fiscal was due to the m dcps contract  which provided over million in implementation revenues 
about one half of the growth in structured cabling revenues related to the m dcps contract 
the remainder of the growth in structured cabling was due to increased new construction and remodeling that occurred prior to the economic downturn and continued market acceptance of our nationwide structured cabling service offering 
systems sales 
sales of systems were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of systems to commercial customers were million in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal sales of systems to hospitality customers were million in fiscal  an increase compared to the prior year 
the increase in sales of systems to commercial customers was attributable to the m dcps contract which produced million in equipment revenues during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in hospitality equipment sales was due to improved penetration into existing accounts  new customer acquisitions and the introduction of the mitel product line 
other revenues 
other revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in other revenues was attributable to an increase in the sales of avaya post warranty maintenance contracts 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal and were negatively affected by the slow down in the growth rate of maintenance and repair services revenues 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues 
see discussion of gross margins on other revenues in the caption gross margins under fiscal year compared to fiscal year above for an explanation of composition of these margins 
corporate cost of goods sold was of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal increases in operating expenses included increased selling expenses primarily in the form of increased sales personnel targeted at selling our wholesale services initiative 
other significant increases were increased costs associated with the support of our oracle platform  increased compensation expense due to the issuance of incentive stock options  increased legal fees related to higher levels of litigation  and increased amortization expense driven by expanded utilization of our enterprise technology platform and the amortization of intangible assets from small acquisitions 
interest expense and other income 
interest expense increased in fiscal by approximately  compared to fiscal reflecting higher average borrowing during the year and the fact that we ceased capitalization of interest costs on the erp implementation project at the end of fiscal the cash cycle on the m dcps project was extremely long and forced us to borrow heavily on our revolving line of credit in fiscal to meet working capital needs 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  in tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal this rate reflected the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in fiscal which reflected improved gross profit margins on the sale of equipment in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our financial condition improved during fiscal as our working capital grew by to million and we generated million in cash flows from operations 
these cash flows included a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of  and an increase in unearned revenue of million 
these positive cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of  a decrease in accrued liabilities of  and other changes in working capital items  which netted a decrease in cash of  the impairment charge to goodwill and other assets of million and the related million decrease in deferred tax liabilities did not impact cash flows in the period 
other non cash charges included amortization of million  depreciation of million  provisions for doubtful accounts receivable and obsolete inventories of  stock based compensation of  and a loss on the sale of assets of  we used these positive cash flows to reduce borrowings on our working capital line of credit by million  to make asset purchases of capitalized hospitality service contracts as well as certain net assets of summatis  together totaling million  acquire capital assets of  reduce our mortgage balance through scheduled principal payments by  and fund other financing and investing activities of  the acquisition of capital assets included  spent as part of normal replacement of our information technology infrastructure and headquarters facility improvements 
the remaining  was spent on our erp implementation 
as noted above  our deferred tax liabilities decreased million during fiscal and the balance of our noncurrent deferred tax asset was  at october  most of this balance and the annual change in this account is due to the difference in accounting for goodwill between generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the us tax code 
under gaap  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is evaluated for impairment 
this evaluation is conducted as conditions warrant  but not less than annually 
the deferred tax liability associated with goodwill accounting will not be reduced unless the company records an additional impairment charge to goodwill 
in fiscal year  goodwill impairment charges of million were recorded 
for tax purposes  goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over years 
as a result  the company receives a tax deduction of approximately th of its goodwill balance each year in its tax return 
deductions taken on the tax return of approximately million annually for amortization is recognized in the balance sheet as a reduction to the deferred tax asset 
the amount recorded in the noncurrent deferred taxes is the difference between the impairment recorded for book purposes and the tax amortization multiplied by the effective tax rate 
this difference is recorded as a non current item because under gaap deferred taxes are recorded as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the asset or liability which generated the deferred tax item 
at october  there were no outstanding draws on our working capital revolver 
we believe our cash balances and available borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
on november  we replaced our previous credit facility with a new loan agreement with a new banking institution 
the new loan agreement consists of an million revolving credit agreement to finance growth in working capital 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  to finance investments beyond our current operating needs we believe we may have access to a variety of capital sources such as private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of equity 
recent accounting pronouncements see notes to consolidated financial statements  note business and summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise considerable judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our judgments predicted 
therefore  the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once actual events unfold 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from equipment sales based on shipment of the equipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectability of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectability of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables that we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from acquisitions made between fiscal and the company accounts for goodwill under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
goodwill recorded as a part of a business combination is not amortized  but instead is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step analysis process 
the first step of the analysis is to determine if a potential impairment exists for a reporting unit by comparing the fair value of the unit with the carrying value of the unit 
the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the unit  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount  if any  of impairment loss to recognize 
the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating all the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  to the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount  then goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value 
macro economic conditions negatively impacted our commercial systems business beginning in the first quarter of fiscal those conditions worsened significantly in the third fiscal quarter 
also  uncertainty regarding the ultimate disposition of the nortel product line grew as nortel began divesting its assets  including assets which are strategic to the company s operations 
finally  the company s sustained decline in market capitalization continued  reflecting market uncertainty regarding the value of the company s operations 
this combination of factors prompted the company to conduct an interim test for impairment as of july  the company engaged a consultant to assist in the valuation of the commercial systems sales and services reporting units 
the company used a combination of evaluations to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  including the following a an income approach by which forecasted future cash flows are discounted to present value  b a market approach by which comparable companies values are compared to the applicable reporting unit s values  and c a market approach by which the company s own market capitalization is applied to the applicable reporting unit 
based on the results of this work  the company determined that the carrying value of the commercial systems sales reporting unit was impaired  and the services reporting unit was not impaired 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million against its commercial systems sales reporting unit as an initial estimate at the end of the third quarter 
the company completed its evaluation of the fair value of this reporting unit including performing the step ii analysis required by asc during the fourth quarter and increased the total goodwill impairment charge to million 
we have recorded property and equipment costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an impairment loss on long lived assets used in operations is recorded when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
during the third fiscal quarter  it was determined that certain identifiable assets related to our erp platform were impaired because the company estimates that full cost of the system cannot be reasonably recovered based on near term projected financial results 
an impairment charge of million was recorded to reduce the company s carrying value of this asset to the mid point of management s estimate of the replacement cost of an erp system that would be adequate for the company s current and near term operating needs 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products assembled or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors  including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we can be a party to threatened or actual litigation 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change
