md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this report 
kellogg company is the world s leading producer of cereal and a leading producer of convenience foods  including cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  fruit snacks  frozen waffles  and veggie foods 
kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally 
we currently manage our operations in four geographic operating segments  comprised of north america and the three international operating segments of europe  latin america  and asia pacific 
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long term annual growth targets 
these targets are low single digit to for internal net sales  mid single digit to for internal operating profit  and high single digit to for diluted net earnings per share eps on a currency neutral basis 
see foreign currency translation section for our definition of currency neutral eps 
for our full year  we were at the high end of our long term annual net sales target with internal growth of

internal net sales and operating profit growth is a non gaap financial measure which is further discussed and reconciled to gaap basis growth on page b see the section entitled foreign currency translation for discussion and reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure 
in combination with an attractive dividend yield  we believe this profitable growth has and will continue to provide a strong total return to our shareholders 
we believe we can achieve this sustainable growth through a strategy focused on growing our cereal business  expanding our snacks business  and pursuing selected growth opportunities 
we support our business strategy with operating principles that emphasize profit rich  sustainable sales growth  as well as cash flow and return on invested capital 
we believe our steady earnings growth  strong cash flow  and continued investment during a multi year period of economic uncertainty demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our business model

d impact of rd shipping week in our consolidated reported net sales were down compared to last year  driven by a negative impact from foreign currency translation and an extra shipping week in excluding this negative impact  internal net sales grew by  lapping last year s strong growth 
while our overall volume declined  we achieved internal sales growth driven by a particularly strong year in retail cereal and a solid year in retail snacks resulting from our pricing and mix 
there were several factors contributing to the volume decline 
in north america  we experienced a supply disruption in our waffle plants 
in both russia and china we are moving our businesses away from lower margin products and going to higher margin branded products which resulted in a decline in volume during the year 
our north america operating segment had internal net sales growth of almost against a difficult comparative in the year ago period 
we experienced growth in retail cereal of and growth in retail snacks  which includes cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars and fruit snacks 
weakness in frozen and specialty channels  which includes frozen foods  food service and vending  dampened net sales for the year  with a decline in net sales of 
cereal continues to be a strong category where we achieved volume growth during the year 
it responds well to innovation and advertising 
we are committed to providing nutritious food to our consumers and introduced froot loops and apple jacks with fiber in august of our business is focused on driving our top brands as well as kashi cereals 
we experienced broad based growth in retail snacks  with sales growth of 
pop tarts continues to perform well and is the category leader in north america toaster pastries 
a strong performance by cheez it  as well as innovation  drove growth in crackers 
cookies posted a slight gain for the year led by our recently acquired mother s brand cookies 
our growth was negatively impacted by heavy competitor activity 
our best performing category within retail snacks was wholesome snacks 
the introduction of fiber plus  special k chocolaty pretzel and cinnabon bars drove growth in this category our frozen and specialty channels business was down  experiencing a tough year due to a few discrete issues 
our food service business is mostly non commercial  serving institutions such as schools  hospitals and prisons 
this sector of the industry was not immediately impacted by the economic downturn that started in while we are seeing a recovery  we believe it will be slower than the commercial sectors such and hotels and restaurants  continuing to impact us until mid we have also been experiencing a supply disruption in our waffle facilities 
we have been making improvements in our facilities and are working with regulatory agencies 
a combination of extensive enhancements and repairs at our facilities and a flood at one facility  significantly impacted production in the second half of the year 
while our plants are operational  they are not running at their previous level of capacity 
demand continues to exceed supply 
we are exploring ways to increase capacity  including investing additional capital  but expect this situation will impact our net sales in this impact is included in our guidance 
our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of on an internal basis 
europe s internal net sales increased year over year 
europe was a tough environment for us in we encountered some retailer disputes earlier in the year that were resolved in the second half of the year  helping us to achieve cereal volume growth 
latin america s internal net sales growth was attributable to both volume and price increases driven by retail cereal in mexico and venezuela 
internal net sales in asia pacific grew  driven by strong cereal performances in australia and india 
our consolidated operating profit was strong  increasing by on an internal basis and by on a reported basis 
reported operating profit in each of our operating segments was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the absence of a rd week in in  we continued to experience cost pressures  increased our spending on up front costs  and invested in advertising 
we were able to more than offset these increased costs by savings from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives as well as pricing and mix 
during the full year of  our up front costs were million  which were million higher than the previous year 
up front costs represent both exit or disposal activities as well as other cost reduction initiatives 
north america s internal operating profit growth of was driven by price and savings from our cost reduction initiatives  which was partially offset by significantly higher up front costs and increased advertising 
up front costs reduced north america s operating profit by 
europe s internal operating profit increased benefiting from media deflation and operating efficiencies while absorbing higher up front costs which reduced operating profit by 
internal operating profit decreased in latin america due to significantly higher material costs and increased advertising 
internal operating profit growth in asia pacific was due to sales growth  while reported operating profit was negatively impacted by the acquisition of navigable foods

d impact of rd shipping week in during  our consolidated reported net sales increased almost driven by our north america business with increases in both volume and price mix for the year 
internal net sales grew over  building on a rate of internal growth during we had a fifty third week in our fiscal year which contributed almost to our reported growth over the prior year as did our acquisitions 
management has estimated the pro forma effect on the company s results of operations as though these business combinations had been completed at the beginning of either or would have been immaterial 
successful innovation  brand building advertising and consumer promotion investment as well as our price increases continued to drive growth 
declines in volume in both europe and latin america were more than offset by growth in pricing mix due to our price increases 
asia pacific had a particularly strong year experiencing growth of driven by cereal sales across the operating segment 
for  our north america operating segment reported a net sales increase of almost with internal net sales growth of 
the growth was broad based and driven by our price realization and strong innovation 
the major product brands grew as follows retail cereal  retail snacks cookies  crackers  toaster pastries  cereal bars  and fruit snacks  frozen and specialty channels frozen foods  food service and vending 
while retail cereal grew for the year  we had a relatively soft share performance in the fourth quarter facing aggressive price based incentives from our competitors 
in addition  while we estimate our consumption was up across all channels  reductions in trade inventory also adversely affected shipments 
as a result  our fourth quarter internal net sales declined by which was up against a tough comparable of growth in the prior year 
our snacks business grew in on top of growth last year 
our growth came from volume  price increases  and successful innovations such as townhouse flipsides and cheez it duoz 
we saw net sales growth in all product categories toaster pastries  crackers  cookies and wholesome snacks 
our right bites calorie cookie and cracker packs performed well as we saw an increase in demand for portion controlled portable food 
our frozen and specialty channels business grew over 
our food service business performed well  achieving mid single digit growth for the year 
frozen realized strong sales driven by innovations such as bake shop swirlz  mini muffin tops and french toast waffles 
our international operating segments collectively achieved net sales growth of  or on an internal basis 
europe s internal net sales grew by almost attributable to price mix  as volume was down slightly 
the uk and continental europe have been impacted by the economic crisis which had consumers searching for value and retailers reducing inventory 
snacks products performed well across the region  especially in the uk driven by rice krispies squares 
latin america s internal net sales growth was attributable to our price increases and driven by cereal sales in mexico and venezuela 
the growth in was on top of growth of 
volume was down for due to the economic environment which impacted consumer confidence 
asia pacific had a very strong year with internal net sales growth 
the growth was volume driven and broad based in both retail cereal and retail snacks 
consolidated operating profit in grew by almost on an as reported basis and on an internal basis 
operating profit in all areas was impacted by cost pressures as discussed in more detail in the margin performance section below 
north america grew by driven by growth in net sales and lower exit costs which offset higher commodity costs 
costs associated with the peanut related recall of kellogg products adversely impacted north america s operating profit by million or of the full year operating profit 
see the voluntary product withdrawal section for more details 
operating profit declined slightly in both europe and latin america due to increased commodity costs and cost reduction initiatives 
asia pacific s operating profit increased on an internal basis due to strong top line growth 
on a consolidated basis  operating profit from acquisitions decreased internal operating profit by  in line with our expectations  with europe and asia pacific being particularly impacted by our russian and chinese acquisitions  respectively 
margin performance margin performance was as follows change vs 
prior year pts 
gross margin a sga b operating margin a gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of goods sold 
b selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales 
we strive for gross profit dollar growth to reinvest in brand building and innovation expenditures 
we maximize our gross profit dollars by managing external cost pressures through product pricing and mix improvements  implementing productivity savings and technological initiatives as well as entering into commodity hedges and fixed price contracts to reduce the cost of product ingredients and packaging 
for full year  our gross profit was up million  despite the negative impact of foreign exchange of million and million of higher up front costs in cost of goods sold cogs 
as illustrated in the preceding table  our consolidated gross margin increased by basis points in our acquisitions lowered gross margin by approximately basis points 
although moderating  we also continue to experience inflationary cost pressures for fuel  energy  commodities and employee benefits 
during the year  higher costs  including increased investment in up front costs recorded in cogs  were more than offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives and price increases 
our selling  general and administrative sga expense as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to higher up front costs of million recorded in overhead as well as an increase in advertising spend 
our decline in gross margin for reflected the impact of significant cost pressure with higher costs for commodities  energy  and fuel being partially offset by the impact of cost reduction initiatives and increased pricing 
for  these cost pressures represented of s cogs  primarily associated with our ingredient purchases 
in  acquisitions negatively impacted margin by basis points 
for  our sga decreased over the prior year due to our strong net sales growth  lower expense related to cost reduction initiatives recorded in sga expense  continued discipline in overhead spending and efficiencies in advertising and promotion 
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
certain of our assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily in the euro  british pound  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  expenses and revenues into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates 
as a result  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if their value has not changed in their original currency 
this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar is substantial 
due to potential volatility in the foreign exchange markets  we measure eps growth and provide guidance on a currency neutral basis  assuming earnings are translated at the prior year s exchange rates 
this non gaap financial measure is being used to focus management and investors on local currency business results  thereby providing visibility to the underlying trends of the company 
management believes that excluding the impact of foreign currency from eps provides a better measurement of comparability given the volatility in foreign exchange markets 
below is a reconciliation of reported eps to currency neutral eps for the fiscal years  and consolidated results diluted net earnings per share eps translational impact a currency neutral eps currency neutral eps growth b a translation impact is the difference between reported eps and the translation of current year net profits at prior year exchange rates  adjusted for gains losses on translational hedges 
b calculated as a percentage of growth from the prior years reported eps 
exit or disposal activities we view our continued spending on cost reduction initiatives as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long term profit growth targets 
initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five year period of completion 
upon completion or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi year programs  the project begins to deliver cash savings and or reduced depreciation 
certain of these initiatives represent exit or disposal plans for which material charges will be incurred 
we include these charges in our measure of operating segment profitability 
management announced its intention to achieve billion of annual cost savings in three years beginning in 
these initiatives are integral to meeting our billion savings challenge 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our exit or disposal activities 
other cost reduction initiatives activities we incurred costs related to our cost reduction initiatives which do not qualify as exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these represent cash costs for consulting and other charges for our cogs and sga programs 
costs incurred in fiscal year as well as total program costs are as follows in millions millions for the year ended january  total program costs through january  cogs programs sga programs total cogs programs sga programs total north america europe latin america asia pacific total the additional cost and cash outlay in for these programs  excluding exit costs  is estimated to be to million 
prior year activities during  we incurred million of expense related to the elimination of the accelerated ownership feature of certain employee stock options 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
this expense was recorded in sga expense within corporate operating profit 
we also incurred million of expense during in connection with a payment for the restructuring of our labor force at a manufacturing facility in mexico 
the cost  which was recorded in cogs and was attributable to the latin america operating segment  resulted in employee benefit cost savings 
interest expense as illustrated in the following table  annual interest expense for the periods has trended down slightly 
the decline in was due primarily to lower commercial paper balances during the year  the impact of our fixed to variable interest rate swaps on our long term debt and lower commercial paper interest rates  partially offset by the costs of early redemption of long term debt  and interest on long term debt issued in interest income recorded in other income expense  net was in millions    the decline for was primarily due to a drop in average interest rates 
we currently expect that our gross interest expense will be approximately to million 
change vs 
prior year dollars in millions reported interest expense a amounts capitalized gross interest expense a reported interest expense for and includes charges of approximately and  respectively  related to the early redemption of long term debt 
other income expense  net refer to note within to notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our long term objective is to achieve a consolidated effective income tax rate of approximately in comparison to a us federal statutory income tax rate of 
we pursue planning initiatives globally in order to move toward our target 
excluding the impact of discrete adjustments and the cost of remitted and unremitted foreign earnings  our sustainable consolidated effective income tax rate for was 
for and  it was and respectively 
we currently expect our sustainable rate to be approximately 
our reported rates of for  for and for were lower than the sustainable rates for those years due to the favorable effect of various discrete adjustments such as audit settlements  international restructuring initiatives and statutory rate changes 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
for  we expect our consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately to 
this could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters  including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives  are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also impact the effective tax rate as it is dependent upon the us dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates 
voluntary product withdrawal refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions 
our cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
we believe that our operating cash flows  together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing  will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that volatility and or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flow is net earnings  meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture and market our products 
our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding  based on a trailing month average is relatively short  equating to approximately days for  days for  and days for the increase in was the result of a decrease in days of trade payables outstanding  while the decrease in was the result of a decrease in days of inventory outstanding 
the following table presents the major components of our operating cash flow dollars in millions operating activities net income year over year change items in net income not requiring providing cash depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes other net income after non cash items year over year change pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions changes in operating assets and liabilities core working capital a other working capital total net cash provided by operating activities year over year change a inventory  trade receivables and trade payables 
our net cash provided by operating activities for was million higher than in  due primarily to positive cash flows associated with other working capital and lower pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions  partially offset by the impact of changes in core working capital and deferred income taxes in net cash provided by operating activities in was million lower than  due primarily to the increase in pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions in and an unfavorable year over year variance in other working capital 
partially offsetting the decrease in operating cash flows was the impact of changes in deferred income taxes and a favorable variance in core working capital 
in  core working capital was an average of of net sales  an increase of compared with in  core working capital was an average of of net sales  an improvement of compared with we manage core working capital through timely collection of accounts receivable  extending terms on accounts payable and careful monitoring of inventory 
in  the favorable year over year variance in other working capital was largely attributable to income taxes and advertising and promotion 
other working capital in reflected an increase in cash paid associated with hedging programs  cash paid for advertising and promotion  and the impact of changes in accrued salaries and wages 
our total pension and postretirement plan funding amounted to million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
during  adverse conditions in the equity markets caused the actual rate of return on our pension and postretirement plan assets to be significantly below our assumed long term rate of return of 
as a result  we decided to make additional contributions to our pension and postretirement plans amounting to million in the fourth quarter of the pension protection act ppa  and subsequent regulations  determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states 
we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  future discount rates based on average yields of high grade corporate bonds and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
we currently project that we will make total us and foreign plan contributions in of approximately million 
actual contributions could be different from our current projections  as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  future changes in government requirements  trust asset performance  renewals of union contracts  or higher than expected health care claims cost experience 
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions 
we use this non gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment  dividend distributions  acquisition opportunities  and share repurchases 
our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities additions to properties cash flow year over year change changes in cash flow as defined for and were primarily attributable to the additional million in pension contributions we made in the fourth quarter of and lower capital expenditures for  we are expecting cash flow as defined to be comparable to we expect to achieve our target principally through operating profit growth  and continued prudent management of our working capital 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for amounted to million  a decrease of million compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in increased by million compared with the reduction in cash used in investing activities in was attributable mainly to the reduction in business acquisition activity in  and to a lesser extent  it also reflected lower capital spending 
during  we used cash to expand our platform for future growth with acquisitions in russia  china  the us and australia 
during  we completed two business acquisitions in order to support the continued growth of our north america operating segment 
acquisitions are discussed in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales amounted to in  in  and in in  we spent capital for a new facility to manufacture ready to eat cereal in mexico and completed the expansion of the global research center located in battle creek  michigan  the w 
k 
kellogg institute for food and nutrition research 
the investment in our global research center  which began in  reflects our commitment to innovation which is a key driver to the growth of our business 
in  we also incurred construction costs to increase manufacturing capacity in europe 
in  we also increased capacity  including the purchase of a previously leased snacks manufacturing facility in chicago  illinois 
we continue to expect our kellogg s lean  efficient  and agile network k lean manufacturing efficiency initiative to result in a trend toward lower capital spending 
going forward  our long term target for capital spending is between and of net sales 
our capital plan projects spending of million  which is at the high end of our to range 
this is driven by a significant investment in our information technology infrastructure as we reinstall and upgrade our sap platform 
we also have plans to expand our manufacturing capacity in  primarily for eggo waffles in the us financing activities our net cash used in financing activities for  and amounted to  million  million  and million  respectively 
total debt was billion at year end and billion at year end the reduction in total debt  primarily commercial paper  resulted from purchasing fewer shares of our stock in compared to in november  we issued million of ten year fixed rate us dollar notes  and used proceeds of million to retire a portion of our us dollar notes due we retired million of the debt through a tender offer  which resulted in million of interest expense and an acceleration of million loss on an interest rate swap  which was previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these charges were included in cash flows from operating activities 
this debt had an effective interest rate of 
in may  we issued million of seven year fixed rate us dollar notes  and used proceeds of million to pay down commercial paper 
in may  we also entered into interest rate swaps on  million of our debt 
interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million effectively converted our us dollar notes due from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remainder of the five year term 
in addition  interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million effectively converted a portion of our us dollar notes due from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the remaining term 
in march  we issued million of five year fixed rate us dollar notes under an existing shelf registration statement 
we used proceeds of million from issuance of this long term debt to retire a portion of our commercial paper 
in conjunction with this debt issuance  we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million  which effectively converted this debt from a fixed rate to a floating rate obligation for the duration of the five year term 
in  we had cash outflows of million in connection with the repayment of five year us dollar notes at maturity in june that debt had an effective interest rate of in february  we redeemed euro notes for million 
to partially finance this redemption  we established a program to issue euro commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million or its equivalent in alternative currencies 
in december  the company issued million of five year fixed rate us dollar notes under the existing shelf registration statement  using the proceeds to replace a portion of our us commercial paper 
our board of directors authorized stock repurchases of up to million for during  we spent million to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
the unused portion of the authorization  amounting to million  was rolled over and is available to be executed against in the board of directors has authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to million bringing the total stock repurchase authorization to  million 
during and  we repurchased million of our common stock each year under programs authorized by our board of directors 
the number of shares repurchased amounted to approximately million and million shares  respectively  in and a separate million share repurchase authorization received board approval in third quarter we made no share repurchases under this authorization because we decided to use cash to fund pension plans and reduce commercial paper in the fourth quarter of the million share repurchase authorization was later canceled 
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling per share in  per share in and per share in total cash paid for dividends increased by in and in our objective is to maintain our dividend pay out ratio between and of reported net earnings 
our long term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit the company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease back transactions 
some agreements also contain change in control provisions 
however  they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings 
a change in the company s credit ratings could limit our access to the us short term debt market and or increase the cost of refinancing long term debt in the future 
however  even under these circumstances  we would continue to have access to our five year credit agreement  which expires in  under which we can borrow up to billion on a revolving credit basis 
this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis  although we do not currently plan to use it 
during the third quarter of and thereafter  capital and credit markets  including commercial paper markets  experienced increased instability and disruption as the us and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty 
throughout this period of uncertainty  we continued to have access to the us and canadian commercial paper markets 
our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings have not been affected by the changes in the credit environment  and the amount of our total debt outstanding remained relatively flat over the past three years 
we monitor the financial strength of our third party financial institutions  including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities  our derivative financial instruments  and other arrangements 
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future  while still meeting our operational needs  including the pursuit of selected bolt on acquisitions 
this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow  our short term borrowings  and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements as of january  and january  the company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future estimated cash payments to be made under existing contractual obligations 
further information on debt obligations is contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
further information on lease obligations is contained in note further information on uncertain tax positions is contained in note contractual obligations payments due by period millions total and beyond long term debt principal interest a capital leases operating leases purchase obligations b uncertain tax positions c other long term d total a includes interest payments on long term fixed rate debt 
b purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under various co marketing agreements and to a lesser extent  of service agreements  and contracts for future delivery of commodities  packaging materials  and equipment 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end  nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not obligated to incur 
therefore  it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts 
c in addition to the million reported in the column and classified as a current liability  the company has million recorded in long term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid 
d other long term contractual obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year end and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements  multiemployer plans  and supplemental employee retirement benefits 
the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through as follows  critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in store displays and events  feature price discounts  consumer coupons  contests and loyalty programs 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded  which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer 
these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
on a full year basis  these subsequent period adjustments have rarely represented more than of our company s net sales 
however  our company s total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a revenue reduction represented approximately of net sales  therefore  it is likely that our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process 
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
for the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples 
our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units 
management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units 
similarly  impairment testing of other intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset 
fair values of non goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset 
for instance  cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants 
these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data  current and anticipated market conditions  management plans  and market comparables 
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non goodwill intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the cash flows of the company 
an intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized  an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
at january   goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to billion  consisting primarily of goodwill and trademarks associated with the acquisition of keebler foods company 
within this total  approximately billion of non goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite lived  comprised principally of keebler trademarks 
we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the company 
at january   the fair value of our north america snacks reporting unit was almost twice its book value 
however  if we had used materially different assumptions  which we do not believe are reasonably possible  regarding the future performance of our business or a different weighted average cost of capital in the valuation  this could have resulted in significant impairment losses and or amortization expense 
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of us and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada 
plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance 
a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments 
we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rates  and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans  which cover employees in the united states  united kingdom and canada 
to conduct our annual review of the long term rate of return on plan assets  we model expected returns over a year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans 
the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long term bonds  price earnings ratios of the major stock market indices  and long term inflation 
our us plan model  corresponding to approximately of our trust assets globally  currently incorporates a long term inflation assumption of and an active management premium of net of fees validated by historical analysis 
although we review our expected long term rates of return annually  our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
our expected rates of return are generally not revised  provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the th and th percentile of expected long term returns  as determined by our modeling process 
our assumed rate of return for us plans in of equated to approximately the th percentile expectation of our model 
similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets  reflecting local economic conditions 
foreign trust investments represent approximately of our global benefit plan assets 
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january   a basis point reduction in the assumed rate of return would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
correspondingly  a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for would result in a similar amount of arising experience loss 
any arising asset related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated value of plan assets over a five year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a declining balance method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants  which for us plans is presently about years 
under this recognition method  a basis point shortfall in actual versus assumed performance of all of our plan assets in would reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million in  increasing to approximately million in for each of the three fiscal years  our actual return on plan assets exceeded was less than the recognized assumed return by the following amounts in millions   
to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a five year historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
in comparison to our actual five year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately  our initial trend rate for of reflects the expected future impact of faster growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population 
our initial rate is trended downward by per year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations at january   a basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
a basis point excess of actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an arising experience loss of approximately million 
any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculated amount of claims experience over a four year period 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years 
the net experience gain arising from recognition of claims experience was approximately million 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we selected the discount rate using the spot yield curve underlying the citigroup index published monthly by citigroup 
using this methodology  we determined the single discount rate for each of our retirement plans that was equivalent to discounting against the entire citigroup spot yield curve 
the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year 
based on consolidated obligations at january   a basis point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase benefits expense by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
despite the previously described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of january   we had consolidated unamortized prior service cost and net experience losses of approximately billion  as compared to approximately billion at january  the year over year decrease in net unamortized amounts was attributable primarily to favorable asset performance during of the total unamortized amounts at january   approximately billion was related to asset losses that occurred during  offset by billion in asset gains during  with the remainder largely related to discount rate reductions and net unfavorable health care claims experience including upward revisions in the assumed trend rate prior to for  we currently expect total amortization of prior service cost and net experience losses to be approximately million higher than the actual amount of approximately million 
total employee benefit expense for is expected to be higher than due to lower discount rates  a further phase in of the investment losses  offset by better than expected investment performance 
based on our current actuarial assumptions  we expect pension expense to increase significantly primarily due to the amortization of net experience losses 
during we made contributions in the amount of million to kellogg s global tax qualified pension programs 
this amount was mostly discretionary 
we anticipate making additional contributions in future years due to the poor performance of global equity markets during additionally we contributed million to our retiree medical programs  most of this contribution was also discretionary and largely used to fund benefit obligations related to our union retiree healthcare benefits 
assuming actual future experience is consistent with our current assumptions  annual amortization of accumulated prior service cost and net experience losses during each of the next several years would increase versus the amount 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions to determine how much benefit should be recognized in our income tax expense 
we establish tax reserves associated with uncertain tax positions based on a benefit recognition model  which we believe could result in a greater amount of benefit and a lower amount of reserve being initially recognized in certain circumstances 
the company evaluates uncertain tax positions in two steps 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merit of the position 
in weighing the technical merits of the position  we consider the facts and circumstances of the position  we assume the reviewing tax authority has full knowledge of the position  and we consider the weight of authoritative guidance 
the second step is measurement  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
while reviewing the ranges of probable outcomes  the company records the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained 
for the periods presented  our income tax and related interest reserves have averaged approximately million 
reserve adjustments for individual issues have rarely exceeded of earnings before income taxes annually 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting our effective tax rate would be separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of our tax reserves and related interest reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within other current liabilities and the amount expected to be settled after one year is recorded in other liabilities 
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods variable interest entities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities vies 
this guidance requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether a company has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie  and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard is effective at the beginning of our fiscal year and must be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
future outlook despite a tough economy in  we met or exceeded all of our long term annual targets 
we are poised to continue this momentum in we expect our business model and strategy will deliver internal net sales growth of to  in line with our long term annual targets of low single digits to 
internal operating profit is expected to grow to  above our long term annual target of mid single digits to 
we expect this growth to result from savings from our up front cost programs as well as lower spending on up front costs 
we expect our earnings per share to grow to  above our long term annual target of high single digit to growth on a currency neutral basis 
gross profit margin percentage is expected to expand by approximately basis points as our savings from cost reduction initiatives will more than offset pressure on cost of goods sold 
gross interest expense for is expected to decline to approximately to million 
our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately to 
we continue to remain committed to investing in brand building  cost reduction initiatives  and other growth opportunities 
lastly  we expect our cash flow performance to remain strong and are currently expecting cash flow to be similar to s result of  million after capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to certain market risks  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
we use derivative financial and commodity instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
refer to note within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments 
foreign exchange risk our company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans and product shipments 
our company is also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  our company is exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus the british pound  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  and mexican peso  and in the case of inter subsidiary transactions  the british pound versus the euro 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contracts  options  and currency swaps to reduce fluctuations in net long or short currency positions 
forward contracts and options are generally less than months duration 
currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the term of underlying debt issuances 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was  million  representing a settlement obligation of million 
the total notional amount of foreign currency derivative instruments at year end was million  representing a settlement receivable of million 
all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions  translational exposure  or existing assets or liabilities  and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the settlement obligation would have increased by approximately million at year end and the settlement receivable would have decreased by million at year end these unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
with regard to our foreign currency exchange risk  we continue to monitor the highly volatile economic environment in venezuela 
on january   the venezuelan government instituted a two tier official exchange rate system which was effective as of january  this resulted in a devaluation of the official rate that had previously been at bolivars per a preferential rate for essential items such as medical  food and heavy machinery was established at bolivars per  referred to as the preferential rate 
all other imports will be imported at bolivars per  referred to as the oil rate 
the government is compiling a list of the items it deems essential which can be imported at the preferential rate 
we are in the process of determining which exchange rates will be applicable to our imports into venezuela 
however  currency exchange restrictions in venezuela restrict our ability to obtain us dollars at the official exchange rates 
us dollars may be obtained through a legal parallel exchange mechanism 
we have and may continue to use this mechanism to exchange bolivars for us dollars in order to satisfy us dollar denominated obligations of our venezuelan operations 
as such  as of the end of our fiscal year  we are using the parallel rate to translate our venezuelan subsidiary s financial statements to us dollars 
the impact of this change was not material to the consolidated financial statements despite rates implied by transactions in the parallel market being significantly higher than the official rates 
inflation in venezuela has been at relatively high levels over the past few years 
we use a blend of the national consumer price index and the consumer price index to determine whether venezuela is a highly inflationary economy 
the blended index exceeded during the fourth quarter of and as such  venezuela will be designated as a highly inflationary economy as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings 
we expect reported net sales and operating profit in latin america will be negatively impacted  and it could be significant to our latin america operating segment 
on a consolidated basis  venezuela represents only to of our business  therefore  the overall impact is expected to be minimal 
interest rate risk our company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing and future issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates  london interbank offered rates libor  and commercial paper rates 
we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate volatility and funding costs associated with certain debt issues  and to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
during and  we entered into interest rate swaps in connection with certain us dollar notes 
refer to disclosures contained in note within notes to consolidated financial statements 
the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps was  million and million  as of january  and january   respectively 
assuming average variable rate debt levels during the year  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million in and million in price risk our company is exposed to price fluctuations primarily as a result of anticipated purchases of raw and packaging materials  fuel  and energy 
primary exposures include corn  wheat  soybean oil  sugar  cocoa  paperboard  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we have historically used the combination of long term contracts with suppliers  and exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted raw material purchases over a duration of generally less than months 
during  we entered into two separate year over the counter commodity swap transactions to reduce fluctuations in the price of natural gas used principally in our manufacturing processes 
the notional amount of the swaps totaled million as of january  and equates to approximately of our north america manufacturing needs over the remaining hedge period 
at year end the notional amount was million 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the north america natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  the settlement obligation would increase by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
the total notional amount of commodity derivative instruments at year end  including the natural gas swaps  was million  representing a settlement obligation of approximately million 
assuming a decrease in year end commodity prices  this settlement obligation would increase by approximately million  generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases 
in some instances the company has reciprocal collateralization agreements with counterparties regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds 
these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash  treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to the company or our counterparties exceeds a certain amount 
there were no collateral balance requirements at january  or january  in addition to the commodity derivative instruments discussed above  we use long term contracts with suppliers to manage a portion of the price exposure associated with future purchases of certain raw materials  including rice  sugar  cartonboard  and corrugated boxes 
it should be noted the exclusion of these contracts from the analysis above could be a limitation in assessing the net market risk of our company
