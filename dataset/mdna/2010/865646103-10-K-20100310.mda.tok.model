item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except share and per share data the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing 
the following discussion is intended to assist in the assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
our business has grown organically in all of our markets 
we derive our revenues from the sale of health  safety and wellness products for infants and toddlers 
our revenue is driven by our ability to design and market desirable products  identify business opportunities and secure new and renew existing distribution channels 
our income from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue and collect cash in excess of labor and other costs of providing our products and selling  general and administrative costs 
company overview we are a designer  marketer  and distributor of branded juvenile health  safety and wellness products which are sold principally to large north american and united kingdom retailers 
we currently have more than proprietary products in various product categories including nursery audio video monitors  safety gates  durable bath products  bed rails  infant thermometers  related health and safety products  booster and potty seats  cribs  baby gear  bouncers and soft goods bedding 
our strategy is to grow our sales through a variety of methods  including increased product penetration more products at each store  increased store penetration more stores within each retail customer  new products at existing and new customers  new retail customers  acquisitions  new geographies international expansion  and new product categories 
we have has been able to grow our annual revenues historically through a combination of all of the above factors 
each year  we have been able to expand the number of products in our main distribution channel  mass merchant retailers  and have also added new customers each year 
therefore  even without new product introductions  we could grow our business by simply selling more of our existing product line to existing customers 
in the future  our growth strategy will be to continue to develop and sell new products to our existing customer base  sell new and existing products to new customers or expand relationships with existing customers  expand our sales of products from our soft goods product line  and expand in the united kingdom and in other geographic regions including japan  mexico and australia  among others 
in addition  there are a number of potential acquisition candidates that could be pursued in order to obtain new innovative products  new product categories  new retail customers or new sales territories 
there are approximately active juvenile product companies  of which approximately have less than million in sales 
in addition  there are various product categories that we do not currently compete in  including car seats  strollers  walkers  and other categories 
we may look to 
table of contents develop our own products in these categories or attempt to gain entrance into these categories through acquisitions 
as we continue to grow through internal initiatives and any future acquisitions  we will incur additional expenses 
two of the key areas in which those increased expenses will likely occur are sales and product development 
to grow sales  we will likely hire additional sales personnel to service new geographic territories  focus existing resources on specific parts of the united states market and retain product line specialists to drive sales of new and existing products in specific areas in which we believe we can readily increase sales 
product development expenses will increase as we develop new products in existing and new categories 
if we were to acquire one or more companies as part of our growth strategy  we would face various challenges such as the integration of the acquired companies product lines  employees  marketing requirements and information systems 
ongoing infrastructure investment also may be required to support realized growth  including expenditures with respect to upgraded and expanded information systems and enhancing our management team 
sales our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of juvenile health  safety and wellness products and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
our products are marketed through several distribution channels including chain retailers  specialty retailers and direct to consumers 
a number of large  retail customers account a majority of our net sales 
the customer that generated more than of net sales for the year ended december  was toys r us of such net sales 
because of the concentration of our business with this customer and because we have no long term contracts with this customer  our success depends on our customers willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
over of sales are currently made to customers in north america  with the remaining sales primarily made to customers in the united kingdom 
sales are made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
we generally accept returns only for defective merchandise 
cost of goods sold and other expenses our products are manufactured by third parties  with approximately of the dollar value of products being manufactured in asia and the majority of the balance being manufactured in the us cost of goods sold primarily represents purchases of finished products from these third party manufacturers 
the remainder of our cost of goods sold includes duties on certain imported items  freight in from suppliers and miscellaneous charges from contract manufacturers 
substantially all of our purchases are made in us dollars  therefore  most of this activity is not subject to currency fluctuations 
if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along those cost increases through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass these price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll  insurance  professional fees  royalties  freight out to customers  product development costs  advertising and marketing expenses including co op advertising allowances as negotiated with certain customers and sales commissions 
several of these items fluctuate with sales  some are based on sales to particular customers and others are based on sales of particular products 
there are not significant variations in seasonal demand for our products 
sales to our retail customers are generally higher in the time frame when retailers take initial shipments of new products 

table of contents these orders usually incorporate enough product to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer s distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year  and whether there are any mid year product introductions 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates this summary of our critical accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of our management  which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity 
these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
some of these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates were made 
however  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of provisions for returns and allowances  product placement fees  cash discounts and markdowns 
we base our estimates for discounts  returns and allowances on negotiated customer terms and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to variability  as actual deductions taken by customers may be different from the estimates recorded 
sales incentives or other consideration given by us to customers that are considered adjustments of the selling price of its products  such as allowances and product placement fees  are reflected as reductions of revenue 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular ad  are reflected as selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying statements of income 
trade receivables we carry our trade receivables at net realizable value 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our trade receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a history of past bad debt expense  collections and current credit conditions 
the allowance is adjusted based on actual write offs that occur 
we have a credit insurance policy to protect against potential losses up to stated amounts from certain customers 
we do not accrue interest on trade receivables 
a receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the credit terms on the account  typically days for most customers 
we will turn an account over for collection around days past due 
accounts are considered uncollectible if no payments are received to days after they have been turned over for collection 
inventory valuation inventory is comprised of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost  inclusive of freight and duty  or market net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
our warehousing costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory write downs are recorded for damaged  obsolete or slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record write downs based on its review of 
table of contents inventory by product category  including length of time on hand and estimates of future orders for each product 
changes in consumer preferences  as well as demand for products  customer buying patterns and inventory management could impact the inventory valuation 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets have been reviewed for impairment based on accounting guidance which requires that an impairment loss be recognized whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventful disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs the entity would recognize as an expense when incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather tested at least annually for impairment 
our management reviews for indicators that might suggest an impairment loss could exist 
testing for impairment requires estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from the use of the assets 
various uncertainties  including changes in consumer preference  deterioration in the political environment  continued adverse conditions in the capital markets or changes in general economic conditions  could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance is based on our assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical trends  customer payment practices  receivable aging and customer disputes 
we will continue to proactively review its credit risks and adjust its customer terms to reflect the current environment 
income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of new accounting guidance which provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon adoption and in subsequent periods 
upon adoption  we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
deferred income tax assets are adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize future tax benefits only to the extent  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not such benefits will be realized 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expect no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months 

table of contents results of operations summer infant  inc and subsidiaries consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and the numbers in the table below are in thousands of us dollars  the text below the table is in whole numbers 
year ended december  year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit sg a expenses a adjusted ebitda b net income a excluding depreciation  amortization  deal related fees  and non cash stock option expense 
b see non gaap discussion below regarding the computation of adjusted ebitda 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased from  in the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased distribution of existing products throughout our customer base  introduction of new products  acquisitions  and international growth 
gross profit increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales 
gross profit percentage increased to of sales for the year ended december  from in the prior year due to cost savings negotiated by the company during selling  general and administrative expenses see note a above increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased variable costs such as co op advertising allowances as a result of the significant increase in sales 
in addition  there were increased expenditures in product development  payroll  professional fees  and warehouse operations 
liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our operations and working capital needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
our sales have increased significantly over the past several years 
this sales growth has led to a substantial increase in working capital requirements  specifically accounts receivable and inventory 
the typical cash flow cycle is as follows inventory is purchased to meet expected demand plus a safety stock 
because the majority of our vendors are based in asia  inventory takes from four to six weeks to arrive from asia to the various distribution points we maintain in the us  canada and the uk 
payment terms for these vendors are approximately days from the date the product ships from asia  therefore we 
table of contents are generally paying for the product a short time after it is physically received in the us 
the increased sales we have experienced result in increased levels of inventory  and therefore an increase in the amount of cash required to fund our inventory level 
sales to customers generally have payment terms of days 
the increased sales have resulted in an increase in the level of accounts receivable  and therefore have increased the amount of cash required to fund working capital 
we have traditionally been able to fund our increased working capital through lines of credit with banks 
the majority of capital expenditures are for tools related to new product introductions 
we receive indications from retailers generally around the middle of each year as to what products the retailer will be taking into its product line for the upcoming year 
based on these indications  we will then acquire the tools required to build the products 
in most cases the payments for the tools are spread out over a three to four month period 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled  this was due to the positive net income generated during the year  plus non cash charges 
in addition  we had a net decrease in working capital requirements due to improved inventory controls and longer payment terms with suppliers 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately  which primarily relates to capital expenditures and acquisitions 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately  which relates to repayments of amounts due on our debt facilities  the positive cash flow from operating activities generated the debt reduction 
based primarily on the above factors  the net cash decrease for the year ended december  was approximately  resulting in a cash balance of approximately  at december  we believe that our cash on hand and current banking facilities are sufficient to fund its cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  unforeseen circumstances  such as softness in the retail industry or deterioration in the business of a significant customer  could create a situation where summer cannot access all of the available lines of credit due to not having sufficient assets or ebitda 
in addition  there is no assurance that summer will meet all of its bank covenants in the future  or that its lender will grant waivers if there are covenant violations 
our strategy for funding its business going forward is a combination of increased profitability  and if necessary  negotiation of increased borrowing lines as required with traditional lenders 
on april   we entered into two three year secured credit facilities the loan agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and each of the financial institutions that is a signatory to the loan agreement 
the loan agreement provides for a  working capital revolving credit facility and a  non restoring acquisition credit facility 
the credit facilities mature on june  summer and its subsidiaries  summer infant usa  inc  summer infant europe limited  summer infant asia limited and summer infant canada  limited are the borrowers under the loan agreement 
these credit facilities replaced summer s prior line of credit and are being used principally to fund growth opportunities and for working capital purposes 
our ability to borrow under the loan agreement is subject to its ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants  including the following i that summer and its subsidiaries maintain a net worth of  plus the sum of of net income earned in each fiscal year  
table of contents ii that summer and its subsidiaries maintain a ratio of total funded debt to ebitda of not greater than  and iii that summer and its subsidiaries maintain a ratio of operating cash flow to debt service of not less than 
furthermore  if the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda is greater than for any fiscal year  the aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the loan agreement will be determined by reference to a borrowing base 
these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate based on a spread over libor ranging from basis points to basis points  depending upon the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda 
we have also entered into various interest swap agreements which fixes the interest rates on a portion of the outstanding debt 
as of december   the rate on these credit facilities averaged 
in addition  these credit facilities have an unused line fee based on the unused amount of the credit facilities equal to basis points 
the loan agreement also contains customary events of default  including a cross default provision and a change of control provision 
in the event of a default  all of the obligations of the company and its subsidiaries under the loan agreement may be declared immediately due and payable 
for certain events of default relating to insolvency and receivership  all outstanding obligations become due and payable 
as of december   we had  outstanding of the total committed amount of  we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total and beyond in thousands line of credit acquisition facility estimated future interest payments on line of credit advances against international receivables operating leases capital leases and other liabilities total contractual cash obligations estimated future interest payments on our line of credit were based upon the interest rates in effect at december  off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during either of the years ended december  and non gaap discussion in addition to our reported results  which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we also disclose non gaap measures of our performance 
adjusted ebitda  as defined below  is an important supplemental financial measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
as used herein  adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before income taxes  interest expense  deal related expenses  depreciation and amortization  and non cash stock option expense 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information regarding our results of operations because it assists in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is 
table of contents useful to stockholders as a measure of comparative operating performance  as it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and more reflective of changes in pricing decisions  cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance 
adjusted ebitda also is used by our management for multiple purposes  including to calculate and support various coverage ratios with our lenders  to allow lenders to calculate total proceeds they are willing to loan to us based on our relative strength compared to other competitors  and to more accurately compare our operating performance from period to period and company to company by eliminating differences caused by variations in capital structures which affect relative interest expense  tax positions and amortization of intangibles 
although we use adjusted ebitda as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business  there are material limitations to using a measure such as adjusted ebitda  including the difficulty associated with using it as the sole measure to compare the results of one company to another and the inability to analyze significant items that directly affect a company s net income loss or operating income because it does not include certain material costs  such as interest and taxes  necessary to operate its business 
in addition  our calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measures that are computed in accordance with gaap 
our management compensates for these limitations in considering adjusted ebitda in conjunction with its analysis of other gaap financial measures  such as net income 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  on a historical basis  for the periods presented reconciliation of income before interest to unaudited adjusted ebitda year ended december  in thousands income before interest plus depreciation and amortization plus litigation and deal related expenses plus non cash stock option expense adjusted ebitda  as defined the increase in adjusted ebitda for the past year has been primarily the result of the sales increase in sales increased from  in to  in for the years ended december  and adjusted ebitda  as defined  includes the addition of certain deal related expenses that we believe to be nonrecurring
