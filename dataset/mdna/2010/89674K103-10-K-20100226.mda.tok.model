item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to stockholders that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules  components and foundry services for communications applications 
we design  develop and manufacture advanced high performance rf solutions with gaas  gan  saw and baw technologies for customers worldwide 
we serve growing markets and a diverse customer base of manufacturers building connected mobile devices  g g cellular base stations  triple play cable solutions  fiber optic networks  wlan  wimax lte  gps and defense and aerospace applications 
strategy and industry considerations our business strategy is to provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions for applications in the mobile device  networks  and defense and aerospace markets 
our mission is  connecting the digital world to the global network  and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within the communications and defense industries 
in the mobile device market  we provide high performance devices such as integrated modules  duplexers  small signal components  power amplifiers  switches and rf filters 
we leverage our manufacturing and integrated module expertise to win additional slots with phone manufacturers adding value added capabilities such as navigation  wimax and wlan 
in networks markets  we are a supplier of both active gaas power and saw and baw filter components 
we provide the defense and aerospace market with phased array antenna radar components 
we have been a leader in gan development since and currently lead phase three of the darpa gan wide bandgap semiconductor rf program 
in  we were awarded the darpa gan next contract to explore advanced high power gan circuits 
wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a significant level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of low demand  selling prices also tend to decrease which  when combined with high fixed manufacturing costs  can create an adverse impact on operating results 
in the worldwide economy slowed and our demand in the first quarter was significantly down 
because we were able to service demand with excess inventory our factories ran at reduced utilization rates resulting in poor first quarter financial performance 
demand returned for most of our markets in the second quarter but remained slow in our networks market throughout for revenues grew compared to and  although our margins improved as the year progressed  the total year gross margin performance was flat as a result of the weak first quarter demand 
mobile devices is the largest of our three major markets 
revenues for increased compared to wcdma or g revenues increased for compared to  cdma revenues increased for compared to  and gsm edge revenues decreased approximately for compared to wlan in mobile devices revenue  with a high attach rate to smartphones  increased for compared to our networks revenues decreased in compared to largely as a result of the slower economy 
basestation revenues increased in compared to with all other major sub markets revenues including transport  wireless client and emerging markets decreasing 
basestation revenues benefited from g spending in china and full year revenues from the wj acquisition compared to a partial year in wireless client revenues decreased due to a significant inventory build by one of our major customers in late that did not fully correct until mid within emerging markets  for the full year  our automotive revenues grew to approximately million with the launch of new automotive radar products 

table of contents our defense and aerospace revenues increased in as compared to direct research and development investment from government and industry partners increased in compared to  radar revenues increased compared to  and all other sub markets revenues combined increased compared to we have focused on the defense market and are recognized for leadership technology in compound semiconductors  baw and saw filters 
our team of engineers are successfully partnering with industry leaders creating next generation solutions 
in the short term we are benefiting from positive cycles in airborne radar programs such as jsf and active electronically scanned array aesa and in the longer term we are shifting our strategy to emulate our successful module efforts in the commercial market 
this involves transitioning from a technology provider to a solutions supplier by creating rf solutions in high performance cost effective packages and modules 
for example  module integration can increase the functionality and reduce the space requirements in a high density phased array antenna 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  the valuation of inventory  which affects gross margin  valuation of investments and debt in privately held companies  which affects net income when we record impairments  valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which affects our tax provision  and stock based compensation  which affects cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  and our reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and foundry services in the mobile devices  networks  and defense and aerospace markets 
we also receive revenues from non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers 
revenues from the sale of products are recognized when title passes to the buyer 
we receive periodic reports from customers who utilize inventory hubs and recognize revenues when the customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  the point at which title to the product passes to the customer 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 

table of contents revenues from our distributors are recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
our distributor agreements provide selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve 
further  the distributor s payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product 
the distributors take title to the product and bear the risks of ownership have economic substance and we have no significant obligations for future performance to bring about resale 
we can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
sales to our distributors were approximately to of our total revenues for  and we allow our distributors to return products for warranty reasons and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and we reserve for such instances 
customers that are not distributors can only return products for warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a combination of standard cost and moving average cost methodologies to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at the lower of cost or market  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we analyze last usage date as well as forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand  and reserve for the excess and identify and record other specific reserves 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying value when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets  plant closure or production line discontinuance  technological obsolescence  or other changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined based on market prices or discounted cash flow analysis  depending on the nature of the asset and the availability of market data 
any estimate of future cash flows is inherently uncertain 
the factors we take into consideration in making estimates of future cash flows include product life cycles  pricing trends  future capital needs  cost trends  product development costs  competitive factors and technology trends as they each affect cash inflows and outflows 
if an asset is written down to fair value  that value becomes the asset s new carrying value and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
investments in privately held companies in previous years  we made a number of investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we held less than of the capital stock or held notes receivable 
we account for all of these investments at cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
during our review  we evaluate the financial condition of the issuer  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the issuer that differ from expectation could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
as of december   our only investment of this type was the investment in cyoptics  inc cyoptics 
the carrying value of the investments is million as of december  
table of contents income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
a significant amount of management judgment is involved in preparing our annual provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our provision for income taxes as of and for each of the years ended december   and was as follows in millions year ended december  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for and primarily consisted of domestic and foreign tax liabilities in united states and costa rica of million and million  respectively 
in january  a million dividend was paid from the costa rican subsidiary 
of the million dividend  the majority was from previously taxed income and the remainder was taxable in no provision has been made for the us  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been  or are intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
in the event the costa rican or german subsidiaries remit these earnings to the us parent  the earnings may be subject to us federal and state income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of these benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets 
we record the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
wj recorded  and we maintained  a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
the company considers future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance and evaluates the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis 
at december   we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
the determination of recording or releasing tax valuation allowances is made  in part  pursuant to an assessment performed by management regarding the likelihood that we will generate future taxable income against which benefits of our deferred tax assets may or may not be realized 
this assessment requires management to exercise significant judgment and make estimates with respect to our ability to generate revenues  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods 
amongst other factors  management must make assumptions regarding overall business and semiconductor industry conditions  operating efficiencies  our ability to develop products to our customers specifications  technological change  the competitive environment and changes in regulatory requirements which may impact our ability to generate taxable income and  in turn  realize the value of our deferred tax assets 
significant operating losses in and prior years  past variances 
table of contents from forecasted income  capacity expansion plans and the recent significant economic uncertainties in the market have made the projection of future taxable income too uncertain to be used as justification for the realization of deferred tax assets 
subsequent events have made forecasting taxable income even more difficult  including the acquisitions of wj and ta which came with prior histories of pre tax losses 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria that allow financial statement benefits to be recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon tax audit  administrative appeals or final court determination 
if payment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
the table below summarizes the stock based compensation expense for  and  included in our consolidated statements of operations in millions year ended december  cost of goods sold stock based compensation expense included in cost of goods sold research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses total stock based compensation expense included in income from operations we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model which requires a number of assumptions  including the expected lives of stock options  the volatility of the public market price for our common stock and interest rates 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the expected life of the award 
acquisition of triaccess technologies  inc  on september   we completed the acquisition of triaccess technologies  inc ta  a provider of cable tv and fiber to the home and rf specific integrated circuits for the amplification of multimedia content  by purchasing of ta s outstanding shares 
details of the purchase price are as follows in millions cash paid at closing  net of cash acquired estimated earnout payment liability total 
table of contents the earnout payment liability has been estimated at its fair value and represents an obligation to pay up to million to the former ta shareholders upon ta product sales meeting certain revenue thresholds over three years beginning in we have estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  using a cash flow based approach discounted with a market discount rate 
in process research and development is considered an indefinite lived asset and will be amortized or impaired upon completion or abandonment of specific projects  estimated to be complete in the next years 
all other intangible assets will be amortized over a period of three to five years 
goodwill is calculated as the purchase price in excess of the fair values of ta s assets and liabilities and represents our opportunity to expand our product line into video delivery  a high margin high growth market we currently underserve 
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
the purchase price was allocated to ta s assets and liabilities based upon fair values as follows in millions tangible assets acquired  net of cash acquired developed technology in process research and development goodwill total the results of operations for the ta business are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period from september  to december  pro forma results of operations have not been presented for this acquisition because its effect was not material to us 
acquisition of wj communications  inc on may   we completed the acquisition of wj  a rf semiconductor company that provides rf product solutions worldwide to communications equipment companies 
we paid million in cash on the closing date and million of direct acquisition costs for of the shares of wj 
the results of operations for the wj business are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period from may  through december  the following unaudited pro forma consolidated information gives effect to the acquisition of wj as if it had occurred on january  after giving effect to certain adjustments  including the amortization of intangible assets  interest income  and tax adjustments  and assumes the purchase price has been allocated to assets and purchased liabilities assumed based on values at the date of purchase 
results may not be indicative of future operating results 
proforma results of operations unaudited year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts revenue net loss income basic eps diluted eps we committed to a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities in san jose  california and china and to reduce certain redundant positions in the wj operations as a result of the acquisition 
the consolidation of the facilities and the reduction of personnel were substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of the plan to consolidate facilities includes partial abandonment of the san jose facility and full abandonment of the china leases 
the china lease expired in and the san jose lease expires in payments related to this restructuring are expected to be complete by during we revised our estimate of future payments relating to the san jose lease  and accordingly  recorded a reduction to the future liability of million

the radar system growth resulted from new program wins along with revenue from ongoing programs 
contract based revenue in grew as a result of new program wins coupled with a pause between phases of major programs in  which resulted in lower revenue in domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in revenues from international customers were approximately million in  
table of contents compared to approximately million in as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from international customers were of revenues in  compared to of revenues in as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from domestic customers grew as a result of the increasing demand for military and network products 
gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat at in and in research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  to million  from million in these expenses increased primarily as a result of increases in labor costs resulting from an increase in headcount and purchases of technical supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million  or  to million from million in these expenses increased in primarily a result of increased commissions  labor costs  and legal costs 
settlement of lawsuit in  we recorded a million settlement of the derivative lawsuit 
impairment of goodwill in  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
during our annual impairment test  because we are one reporting unit  we determined that the trading price of our stock  adjusted for a control premium which is the implied fair value  was lower than the book value 
we then performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount similar to a purchase price allocation 
the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value and we recorded an impairment charge for the entire balance of goodwill 
no goodwill impairment charges were incurred in in process research and development in  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development  resulting from the acquisition of wj  which was completed on may  no in process research and development charges were incurred in other income expense  net other net income in decreased million  or  to million from million in the major driver of the decrease in other income was a result of a decrease in interest income of million as a result of lower interest rates and by an increase in foreign exchange loss of million 
the increase was offset by million impairment charge for cyoptics taken in that did not occur in income tax expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to income tax expense of million in the decrease was attributable to our costa rican subsidiary s new tax holiday and the expiration of certain statute of limitations related to our uncertain income tax liability

table of contents international customers continued to grow as a result of the increasing demand for wireless mobile devices and infrastructure products in developing regions  where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us and western europe 
gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared to in the gross profit margin in included an excess inventory charge of million for a single customer 
gross profit margin in increased by a small percentage due to higher efficiency and utilization rates offset by the unfavorable effect of elevated precious metals prices 
research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  to million  from million in research  development and engineering expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in labor costs as a result of increased headcount  the acquisition of wj and purchases of technical supplies

we then performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount similar to a purchase price allocation 
the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value and we recorded an impairment charge for the entire balance of goodwill 
no goodwill impairment charges were incurred in in process research and development in process research and development costs totaling million and million in and  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of peak devices  inc  which was completed on august  and from the acquisition of wj  which was completed on may  gain on disposal of equipment gains and losses on disposals of equipment are recorded based upon the disposal price  less the book value of the equipment 
we recorded a gain of million and a loss of million on the disposal of equipment in and  respectively 
impairment of investment in  we recorded a million investment impairment charge related to our investment in cyoptics offset by a million recovery in a previously impaired investment 
no investment impairment charges were incurred in 
table of contents interest income  net interest income  net decreased million in to million  compared to interest income  net of million in the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest income of million as a result of lower interest rates and cash balances 
income tax expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million  compared to income tax expense of million in the increase was a result of an increased amount of taxes paid in costa rica 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million  or  to million  from million as of december  the increase was primarily due to cash generated from operations and stock issuances includes withholdings for employees stock purchase plan  partially offset by capital expenditures and transactions related to the purchase of ta 
at december   our net accounts receivable balance increased million  or  to million  from million at december   including amounts acquired in connection with the purchase of ta of million 
this increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in our days sales outstanding were days as of december  compared to days as of december  at december   our net inventory balance decreased million  or  to million  compared to million at december   including amounts acquired in connection with the purchase of ta of million 
the decrease in inventory was a result of higher inventory levels in in anticipation of strong demand which did not fully materialize in due to the economic decline 
inventory turns  calculated using ending inventory  were for compared to for at december   our net property  plant and equipment increased million  or  to million  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to capital expenditures of million during  partially offset by depreciation of million 
the capital expenditures made in were for the purpose of increasing capacity  to support new products and technologies  and to replace aging equipment 
the increase was also due to the transfer of land of million to property  plant and equipment from available for sale in other current assets in the current year 
at december   our accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  to million  compared to million at december  the increase was consistent with our increase in material purchases and capital expenditures 
recent transactions affecting liquidity on september  we completed the acquisition of ta and paid to former ta shareholders  net cash of million on the closing date 
sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations and the balance available on our revolving loan  constitute our principal sources of liquidity 
we believe these will satisfy our projected working capital  capital expenditure and possible investment needs through the next months 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are lower than expected earnings or capital expenditures in excess of our expectations 

table of contents we currently expect capital expenditures of approximately million in other significant cash obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  that will affect our future liquidity in millions total payments due by period in millions less than year years years more than years operating leases deferred compensation restructuring accrual triaccess earnout sabbatical other obligations total the amounts presented represent leases of certain equipment  office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
the amount presented represents the liability for our non qualified deferred compensation plan the plan established in october the plan provides employees who are eligible to participate and the members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation 
the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are also obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment 
we include the asset deferred by the participants million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item of our consolidated balance sheet and our obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
the balance represents the liability for severance related costs associated with the reduction of force to reduce certain redundant positions in the wj operations as a result of the acquisition 
lease amounts for the remainder of the restructuring accrual are included in item above 
the balance represents the earnout payment liability that has been estimated at its fair value and represents an obligation to pay up to million to the former ta shareholders upon ta product sales meeting certain revenue thresholds over three years beginning in the balance represents the estimated commitments for sabbatical payments for all eligible full time employees 
the balance represents the estimated pension liability of our german subsidiary 
the pension liability becomes payable when the covered employees reach the age of or the liability was acquired through our purchase of the gaas business of infineon in we elected to secure the liability through a reinsurance program supported by us 
we have included the reinsurance receivables million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our obligation to deliver the pension obligation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had approximately million in net tax liabilities  which are included as long term income tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
although we have considered the affect of this obligation  we generally do not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
further  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 

table of contents accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance regarding multiple delivered revenue arrangements which updates  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relevant selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
upon adoption  application of the residual method will no longer be permitted and entities will be required to disclose more information about their multiple element revenue arrangements 
the new standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
if a company elects early adoption and the period of adoption is not the beginning of its fiscal year  the requirements must be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year 
although we are still analyzing the effects of the adoption of this standard  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents our investments in cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments are classified as available for sale securities and consist of highly rated  short term and long term investments  such as money market funds  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
in addition  at december   we did not have any investments in auction rate securities 
further  we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially affected by an immediate change in interest rates 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments as of december  in millions cost fair value cash equivalents including unrealized gain of less than available for sale investments including net unrealized gains of less than foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica and germany 
we manage the foreign currency risk of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican and german operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars
