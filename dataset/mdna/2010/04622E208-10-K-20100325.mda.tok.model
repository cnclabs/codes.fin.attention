item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  markets and supports service management software solutions  which are licensed to companies that sell and service equipment  or sell and deliver professional services 
the company s principal product offerings  astea alliance and fieldcentrix enterprise suites  integrate and automate sales and service business processes and are designed to assist its users to increase competitive advantages  top line revenue growth and profitability through better management of information  people  assets and cash flows 
we believe that astea alliance offers substantially broader and far superior capabilities over the company s predecessor product  dispatch  which was designed for only field service and customer support management applications 
the company s products and services are primarily used in industries such as information technology  medical devices and diagnostic systems  industrial controls and instrumentation  retail systems  office automation  imaging systems  facilities management and telecommunications 
an eclectic group of other industries  all with equipment sales and service requirements  are also represented in astea s customer base 
the company maintains offices in the united states  united kingdom  australia  israel  japan and the netherlands 
the company generates revenues from two sources software license fees for its software products  and services and maintenance revenues from professional services  which includes consulting  implementation  training and maintenance related to those products 
software license fees accounted for of the company s total revenues in  which was fairly evenly split between sales of astea alliance and fieldcentrix 
software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily knowledge management  mapping and analytical software licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
the remaining component of the company s revenues consists principally of fees derived from professional services associated with the implementation and deployment of the company s software products and maintenance fees for ongoing customer support  primarily external customer technical support services and product enhancements 
professional services including training are charged on an hourly or daily basis and billed on a regular basis pursuant to customer work orders 
training services may also be charged on a per attendee basis with a minimum daily charge 
out of pocket expenses incurred by company personnel performing professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are performed 
maintenance fees are typically paid to the company under written agreements entered into at the time of the initial software license 
maintenance revenue  which is generally invoiced annually  is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting p olicies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
the company recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
we utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products support and services are sold to our customers 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectability is not co nsidered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
however  if acceptance criteria are required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
there may be cases  however  in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s but no such evidence for the delivered item s 
in those cases  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the unde livered item s 
we apply the revenue recognition policies discussed below to each separate unit of accounting 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price  at the date of sale  if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
if an undelivered element for which evi dence of fair value does not exist  all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which  in the company s opinion  approximate fair value 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
we believe that our accounting estimates used in applying our revenue recognition are critical because the determination that it is probable that the customer will pay for the products and services purchased is inherently judgmental  the allocation of proceeds to certain elements in multiple element arrangements is complex  the determination of whether a service is essential to the functionality of the software is complex  establishing company specific fair values of elements in multiple element arrangements requires adjustments from time to time to reflect recent prices charged when each element is sold separately  and the determination of the stage of completion for certain consulting arrangements is complex 
changes in the aforementioned items could have a material effect on the type and timing of revenue recognized 
if we were to change our pricing approach in the future  this could affect our revenue recognition estimates  in particular  if bundled pricing precludes establishment of vsoe 
we present taxes assessed by a governmental authority including sales  use  value added and excise taxes on a net basis and  therefore  the presentation of these taxes is excluded from our revenues and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such amounts are remitted to the taxing authority 
cost of software license fees cost of software license fees includes amortization of the capitalized software development cost and third party license sold to customers 
cost of services and maintenance cost of services and maintenance includes compensation and benefits provided to our professional service employees  independent consultants  telecommunication cost  unreimbursed travel expenses  and facility costs 
product development cost of product development includes our research and development expenses which consist primarily of personnel and related costs  including salaries and employee benefits for software engineers 
to date  our product development efforts have been devoted to new products and service offerings and increases in features and functionality of our existing products and services 
cost of sales and marketing cost of sales and marketing includes compensation and benefits from our sales force and marketing team  telecommunications cost  marketing and sales costs  professional fees and facility costs 
general and administrative costs cost of general and administrative costs include salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  accounting costs  bad debt expense  legal costs  professional fees  corporate facility costs  and other costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to ten years for computers and related equipment  furniture and fixtures  software and office equipment  and the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives which range from five to ten years 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from post contract support  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered or license revenue which has been deferred until all revenue recognition requirements have been met or services are performed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its customer accounts that are significantly past due  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but due to contractual restraints over timing of invoicing  the company does not have the right to invoice the customer 
we believe that our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because of the significance of our accounts receivable balance relative to total assets 
if the general economy deteriorated  or factors affecting the profitability or liquidity of the industry changed significantly  then this could affect the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
capitalized software and research and development costs the company capitalizes software development costs incurred during the period subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  other headcount related costs associated with product development and any related costs to third parties under sub contracting or net of any collaborative arrangements 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products beginning with the initial release to customers 
the company s estimated life for its capitalized software products is two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated futur e revenues of each product 
we believe that our estimate of our capitalized software costs and the period for their amortization is critical because of the significance of our balance of capitalized software costs relative to our total assets 
potential impairment is determined by comparing the balance of unamortized capitalized software costs to the sales revenue projected for a capitalized software product 
if efforts to sell that software product are terminated  or if the projected sales revenue from that software product drops below a level that is less than the unamortized balance  then an impairment would be recognized 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october it is also tested between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exists  as for example when the company s market capitalization significantly declines for a sustained period  using a fair value based approach 
the company uses a two step method for determining goodwill impairment  the market and income approaches 
the market approach analyzed the market valuations of similar companies in our peer group based on recent market conditions 
the income approach analyzed the company s expectation for future results based on current and expected economic conditions 
no impairment of goodwil l has been identified during any of the periods presented 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual financial results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
stock based compensation option plans the company records stock based compensation using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation costs recognized in include a compensation costs for all share based payments granted to employees and directors prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date value estimated and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model 
this model requires the input of assumptions including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have a stronger weight th an other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets were generated primarily by operating losses 
accordingly  it is more likely than not  that we will not realize these assets through future operations 
the company prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
estimated interest is recorded as a component of interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses 
in  the israel taxing authority ita notified the company that it intends to re examine a transaction that it had previously approved 
the company is vigorously defending itself in court and based on information to date  does not expect this issue to result in any additional tax to the company 
convertible preferred stock on september   the company sold  shares of series a convertible preferred stock preferred stock to its chief executive officer at a price of per share for a total of  dividends accrue daily on the preferred stock at an initial rate of and shall be payable only when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors  quarterly in arrears 
the preferred stock may be converted into common stock at the initial rate of one share of common for each share of preferred stock 
after six months  there is no limit on the number of shares that may be converted 
commencing two years after issuance  the company shall have certain rights to cause conversion of all of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding 
commencing four years after issuance  the company may redeem  subject to board approval  all of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding at a price equal to the greater of i of the purchase price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and ii the fair market value of such number of shares of common stock which the holder of the preferred stock would be entitled to receive had the redeemed preferred stock been converted immediately prior to the redemption 
in accordance with relevant accounting guidance  the company recorded the preferred stock on the company s consolidated balance sheet within stockholders equity 
the preferred stock is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount of net proceeds received less an imputed dividend cost 
the imputed dividend cost of  was the result of the preferred stock having a dividend rate during the first two years after its issuance that is lower than the rate that becomes fixed after the initial two year period 
the imputed dividend cost of  is being amortized over the first two years from the date of issuance and is based upon the present value of the dividend discount using a yield 
recently adopted accounting guidance in may  we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb which established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued  the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this establishes the codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
this is effective for financial statements issued for the interim and annual periods ending after september  in september  guidance was issued by the fasb that addresses the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for a period that includes the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock 
the guidance addresses the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock and the carrying amount of the preferred stock in the registrant s balance sheet should be subtracted from net income to arrive at income available to commons stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share 
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on january   we adopted authoritative guidance issued by fasb on business combinations 
the guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations 
it also requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
we adopted this guidance for all business combinations that occur after january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb that changes the accounting and reporting for non controlling interests 
non controlling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to a non controlling interest is to be included in net income and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income 
adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in january  the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires new disclosure on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of fair value measurements hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance will become effective with the reporting period beginning january   except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level fair value measu rements  which will become effective for the reporting period beginning july  we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning july   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance  arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables i n an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for us beginning january  the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  selected financial data and the percentages of the company s total revenues represented by each line item presented for the periods presented years ended december  revenues software license fees services and maintenance total revenues costs and expenses cost of software license fees cost of services and maintenance product development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses net loss comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  software license revenues decreased in  compared to services and maintenance fees for amounted to  a decrease from software license fee revenues decreased  or to  in from  in astea alliance license revenues decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
the overall decrease is attributable to a significant decline in license sales in most regions of the world in which the company operates resulting from the economic slowdown affecting the entire world in however  license sales in europe increased over due to renewed marketing efforts and a very low base in the timing of the sales cycle continues to be long  which further extends the time to convert a sales opportunity into a completed sale 
the company sold  of fieldcentrix licenses in compared to  in  an increase of 
the company did not have any license revenue in or from its existing dispatch customers 
total services and maintenance revenues decreased  or to  in from  in service and maintenance revenue declined  or on the astea alliance products 
the primary cause of the decline in service and maintenance revenue resulted from a reduction in implementation projects due to lower license sales 
there were a number of ongoing projects as well as upgrades of existing customers from older versions of the company s software to its latest versions 
fieldcentrix service and maintenance revenue increased  which is over its revenues 
the slight increase resulted mostly from ongoing projects within its install base of customers 
dispatch service and maintenance revenues decreased by to  in from  in due to the decreasing demand for dispatch professional services and the lack of any related product development by the company  the decrease in service and maintenance revenue is expected to continue beyond in and no customers represented or more of total revenues 
costs of revenues 
costs of software license fee revenues decreased to  in from  in the decrease results from decreased amortization of capitalized software development costs related to version  which was fully amortized after the first quarter of compared to a full year s amortization in amortization of capitalized software decreased to  in from  in the gross margin percentage on software license sales was in and in the slight improvement in the margin results from the overall decrease in cost of sales discussed above  partially offset by a reduction in license revenue 
costs of services and maintenance revenues decreased to  in from  in the decrease in cost of services and maintenance was primarily attributed to decreases in salary expense resulting from worldwide cost containment programs and a decline in share based compensation expense for employees which declined from  in to  in the service and maintenance gross margin percentage decreased slightly to in from in the decreased margin was primarily attributable to pricing pressure on professional services in resulting from the world wide economic recession and lower license sales in product development 
product development expense decreased  or  to  in from  in development costs decreased due to an decrease in headcount in from the same period in in addition  the exchange rate of the israeli shekel  the country where most of the company s development is performed  decreased by in value over compared to additionally   in share based compensation expense for employees was recorded at december  compared to  expense for year ending december  product development as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in this decrease in costs relative to expenses was due to the overall decrease in product development expense in compared to gross development expense before the capitalization of software costs and was  in  a decrease from  in capitalized software totaled  in compared to  in the decrease in capitalized software of over last year resulted from the headcount reduction and improved foreign exchange rates 
in  the company released version of its astea alliance product 
in  the company released version of its fieldcentrix offering 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in headcount during  lower commissions paid due to lower license sales in and the company s overall aggressive cost containment program 
additionally   in share based compensation expense for employees was expensed in compared to  expensed in the company continues to focus on improving its market presence through intensified marketing efforts to increase awareness of the company s products 
this occurs through the use of webinars focused in the vertical industries in which the company operates  attendance at selected trade shows  and increased efforts in lead generation for its sales force 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in principally resulting from the decrease in costs in compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  legal costs  accounting costs  bad debt expense and various costs associated with the company s status as a public company 
the company s general and administrative expenses were  in and  in expenses in declined  a decrease 
this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense resulting from a pay reduction 
in addition  share based compensation expense decreased by  from to  in as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses amounted to in compared to in the slight increase in expenses relative to revenues primarily results from the decrease in revenues and the fixed nature of many of these expenses 
interest income 
net interest income decreased  to  in from  in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates in compared to income tax expense 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on the company s current year and historical operating losses  the company determined maintaining a full valuation allowance was appropriate 
the company recorded a provision of  in and  in for income taxes 
in and   and  respectively  of expense resulted from a difference between an indefinite lived asset  goodwill  which is amortized for tax  but not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
the additional  in relates to foreign taxes 
international operations 
total revenues from the company s international operations decreased slightly by  or less than to  in from  in the decrease in revenue from international operations was attributable to a decrease in revenue in europe resulting from the worldwide economic recession 
however  this was mostly offset by a increase in the asia pacific region 
revenue from asia pacific increased due to the opening of a new office in japan in january japan had been serviced directly by a local reseller in prior years 
overall  international operations generated a net loss of  for compared to net loss of  in the principal cause of the additional loss in was the result of exchange losses of  in compared to exchange gains of  in net loss 
the company generated a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to net loss of  in the reduced loss of  is primarily the result of a reduction in operating costs  partially offset by a reduction in revenues 
the decrease in revenues is due to the slowdown in purchasing software solutions by companies throughout the world  due to the uncertainty surrounding the word wide economy 
as the recession slowed down towards the latter part of  business activity improved slightly as reflected in the number of opportunities the company pursued at the end of as well as the number of license deals that were closed in the last quarter of liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   an increase of  over the year ended december  in which  of cash was generated by operations 
the increase was primarily attributable to lowering the net loss for the year by  and a net increase in deferred revenues of  the significant increase in deferred revenues occurred due to the recognition of deferred of license  professional services and maintenance revenues in from transactions that occurred in prior years 
partially offsetting the increases in cash flow were a decrease in noncash expenses of  a decrease in the growth of accounts receivable of  compared to  a decrease in accounts payable of  and an increase to prepaid expenses of  investing activities the company used  of cash for investing activities in compared to using  in the decrease in cash used for investing activities of  results from a decrease in property and equipment purchases of  a net increase of short term investments over short term investments purchased of  and a decrease in capitalized software development costs of  in the decrease in capitalized software costs resulted from the aggressive cost reduction plan implemented throughout the company in as a proactive way to address the impact of the worldwide economic recession on the company 
partially offsetting the reduced expenditures of cash for investing activities was a reduction in the amount of cash released from restrictions of  financing activities the company generated  less from financing activities in compared to in  the company generated  in proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and incurred issuance costs of  in there were related dividend payments on the preferred stock of  compared to  in at december   the company had a working capital ratio of approximately compared to at december  the company had  in cash and investments available for sale at year ended december   compared to  for year ended december  the company has projected revenues for that will generate enough funds to sustain its continuing operations 
in addition  the company has initiated a number of cost containment programs which are expected to reduce the cost of operating the business 
the company expects its cash from operations to fund all of its financing needs for the upcoming year 
however  if actual results trail expectations  the company has plans in place to reduce operating expenditures appropriately in order to continue to fund all required expenditures 
the board of directors from time to time reviews the company s forecasted operations and financial condition to determine whether and when payment of a dividend or dividends is appropriate 
the company does not plan any significant capital expenditures in other than to replace its existing capital equipment as it becomes obsolete 
the impact of the strengthening dollar relative to the currency in the other regions of the world in which it operates have also contributed to reducing operating costs in other parts of the world 
in addition  it does not anticipate that its operations or financial condition will be affected materially by inflation 
on may  the company entered into a secured revolving line of credit line agreement with a bank 
that agreement was amended in june of with an expiration date of june  the line of credit was modified on july  to a guidance line of credit where all draws will be at the bank s discretion and has a one year term 
the guidance line of credit has no fees associated with it 
the guidance line of credit interest rate is the prime rate  with a floor of 
there were no amounts outstanding as of december  and as of march   the amount outstanding on the guidance line of credit was zero 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual and commercial obligations  as of december  payment due by period total and after contractual cash obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases amounts of commitment expiration per period total and after other commercial commitments letters of credit dividends may be paid on common stock  when and if  declared by the board of directors 
however  no dividend has been paid on common stock since january dividends on convertible preferred stock are currently payable at  payable on quarterly basis in arrears  as declared by the board of directors 
if not paid  the rate increases to until paid 
in september  the dividend will be increased to off balance sheet transactions there are no off balance sheet transactions that would require disclosure in the above contractual obligations and commercial commitments table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as a result  as of december   the company s investments consisted of institutional money market funds and corporate bonds with maturities of less than days 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk all costs associated with the company s foreign operations in europe  asia pacific  japan and israel are denominated in their respective local currencies and translated into us dollars for financial reporting 
as a result  the company is exposed to risks to the extent that the rate of inflation in any of its foreign operating regions differs from the rate of revaluation of their related currencies in relation to the us dollar or if the timing of such revaluations lags behind inflation in these regions 
in such an event  the costs of the company s operations in these regions  measured in us dollars  will change and the us dollar measured results of operations will be affected
