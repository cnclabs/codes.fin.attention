item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of alliance bankshares corporation bankshares  alliance bank corporation bank  alliance bank mortgage division abmd and alliance home funding ahf  on a consolidated basis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with bankshares consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements some of the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding profitability  liquidity  adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  interest rate sensitivity  market risk and financial and other goals 
forward looking statements often use words such as believe  expect  plan  may  will  should  project  contemplate  anticipate  forecast  intend or other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
the forward looking statements we use in this report are subject to significant risks  assumptions and uncertainties  including among other things  the following important factors that could affect the actual outcome of future events changes in the strength of the national economy in general and the local economies in our market areas adversely affect our customers and their ability to transact profitable business with us  including the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans according to their terms or a change in the value of the related collateral  changes in the availability of funds resulting in increased costs or reduced liquidity  changes in accounting policies  rules and practices  increased asset levels and changes in the composition of assets and the resulting impact on our capital levels and regulatory capital ratios  changes in market conditions  specifically declines in the residential and commercial real estate market  volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  and soundness of other financial institutions we do business with  our ability to expand and grow our business and operations  including the establishment of additional branches and acquisition of additional branches and banks  and our ability to realize the cost savings and revenue enhancements we expect from such activities  the timing of and value realized upon the sale of other real estate owned oreo property  changes in the assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for possible loan losses and other estimates  fiscal and governmental policies of the united states federal government  changes in the temporary liquidity guarantee program  continued increases in fdic insurance premiums and special assessments  loss of key production or managerial personnel  changes in interest rates and market prices  which could reduce our net interest margins  asset valuations and expense expectations  timing and implementation of certain balance sheet strategies  impairment concerns and risks related to our investment portfolio  and the impact of fair value accounting  including income statement volatility  assumptions used within our asset liability management alm process and net interest income nii and economic value of equity eve models  changes in tax laws and regulations  our ability to recognize future tax benefits  maintaining and developing well established and valuable client relationships and referral source relationships  our ability to acquire  operate and maintain cost effective and efficient systems without incurring unexpectedly difficult or expensive but necessary technological changes  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  competitive factors within the financial services industry  impacts of implementing various accounting standards  and other factors described from time to time in our sec filings 
in addition  a continuation of the turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets  particularly if it worsens  could further impact our performance  both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally 
dramatic declines in the residential and commercial real estate markets over the past two years have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions in the united states  and have affected our levels of nonperforming assets and oreo 
concerns about the stability of the us financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions  leading to a tightening of credit  reduction of business activity  and increased market volatility 
there can be no assurance that actions taken by the federal government will stabilize the us financial system or alleviate the industry or economic factors that may adversely affect our business 
in addition  our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment  both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape 
because of these and other uncertainties  our actual results and performance may be materially different from results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
we caution you that the above list of important factors is not exclusive 
these forward looking statements are made as of the date of this report  and we may not undertake steps to update these forward looking statements to reflect the impact of any circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward looking statements are made

the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in estimating risk 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our financial statements could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting asc  contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and asc  receivables formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance for impaired credits and the general allowance based on relevant risk factors 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for loans identified as impaired 
impairment testing includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  support available from financial guarantors and the fair market value of collateral 
these factors are combined to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
when impairment is identified  a specific reserve is established based on bankshares calculation of the loss embedded in the individual loan 
the general allowance is the largest component of the total allowance and is determined by aggregating un criticized loans and unimpaired loans by loan type based on common purpose  collateral  repayment source or other credit characteristics 
we then apply allowance factors which in the judgment of management represent the expected losses over the life of the loans 
in determining those factors  we consider the following delinquencies and overall risk ratings  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of the borrowers management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit by individual credit size and by class of loans  quality of loan review system and the effect of external factors eg  competition and regulatory requirements 
goodwill 
bankshares adopted asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill related to the aia acquisitions was tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances warranted 
for the year ended december   bankshares tested the goodwill carrying value 
based upon the results of the testing  bankshares concluded that there was impairment during we recorded an impairment charge of thousand in under asc  acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over its useful life 
the costs of other intangible assets  based on independent valuation and or internal valuations  were amortized over their estimated lives 
on december   the bank entered into and closed on a stock purchase agreement to sell the insurance agencies eliminating the goodwill and intangible assets carried on our books 
share based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued asc  stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment 
asc requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options and nonvested shares  based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant 
compensation cost has been measured using the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of an award on the grant date and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period

interest income and expense net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million in or million higher than the level of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the substantial decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the following table illustrates average balances of total interest earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated  showing the average distribution of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and related income  expense and corresponding weighted average yields and rates 
the average balances used in these tables and other statistical data were calculated using daily average balances

trading securities averaged million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as part of our strategic management of the balance sheet  we took proactive steps to reduce the size of the trading portfolio 
specifically  we sold our entire sba securities portfolio in trading securities interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the average yield on trading securities decreased to in  a decrease of basis points compared to the same period in investment securities averaged million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  investment securities income was million on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the average tax equivalent yields on investment securities for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
in  we actively added investment securities to the balance sheet 
the securities added to the balance sheet complement the overall deposit growth of the bank and are an attractive alternative to the very low yields received from federal funds sold 
a certain portion of the bank s excess liquidity is invested in federal funds sold 
for the year ended december   federal funds sold contributed thousand of interest income  compared to thousand for the same period in average interest bearing liabilities deposits and purchased funds were million in  which was million more than the level of million 
interest expense for all interest bearing liabilities amounted to million for the year ended december   a million decrease from the level of million 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december  was  or basis points lower than the level of 
average time deposits were million  up million over the level 
average fhlb advances were million in or million lower than the average of million 
average other borrowings were million as of december   a decrease of million from the level 
non interest bearing demand deposit balances averaged million as of the year ended december   or million more than the year ended december  these balances are subject to seasonal changes 
the following table describes the impact on our interest income and expense resulting from changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated

non performing assets impaired loans performing loans with a specific allowance allocation 
as of december   impaired loans amounted to million  compared to an impaired loan balance of million as of december  the majority of the million is made up of two loans  one loan for thousand which relates to building lots in northern virginia  and one loan for thousand which relates to commercial real estate in king george  virginia 
these two loans have a specific allocation of the allowance of thousand 
nonaccrual loans 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status when the loan is specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent days or more 
we closely monitor individual loans  and relationship officers are charged with working with customers to resolve potential credit issues in a timely manner with minimum exposure to bankshares 
we maintain a policy of adding an appropriate amount to the allowance for loan losses to ensure an adequate reserve based on the portfolio composition  specific credit extended by bankshares and general economic conditions 
on december   alliance bank had million in loans that were on nonaccrual status compared to loans that were on nonaccrual status totaling million at december  the million balance consists of a loan for thousand  which is secured by business assets in northern virginia  a loan for thousand secured by building lots in northern virginia  a loan for thousand secured by a residential condominium project in virginia beach  a loan for thousand secured by a subordinate lien on a commercial real estate property in winchester  virginia and a variety of loans totaling million to eight borrowers secured by first and second mortgages on properties in the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
the specific allowance set aside for non accrual loans as of december  is million 
other real estate owned oreo 
as of december   we had million classified as oreo on the balance sheet  compared to million as of december  the bulk of the oreo balance consists of million which is residential development land in northern virginia  million which relates to farmland development acreage in the winchester  virginia area  thousand which relates to residential building lots in northern virginia  and thousand which relates to building lots in northern virginia

as of december   we had million classified as non performing assets on the balance sheet 
the balance as of december  was million 
this decrease is due to the sale of several oreo properties 
the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was as of december  compared to as of december  this represents a basis point improvement in the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets 
the shift in non performing asset categories reflects the migration of loans from impaired  to nonaccrual and from there to oreo as seen in the following table

we maintain a policy of adding an appropriate amount to the allowance for loan losses to ensure an adequate reserve based on the portfolio composition  specific credit extended by alliance bank and general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   or of loans outstanding  compared to million or of loans outstanding  at december  these ratios exclude loans held for sale 
we have allocated million and million  respectively  of our allowance for loan losses at december  and december  for specific non performing loans 
in  we had net charge offs of million compared to million in and million in there were no loans past due and still accruing interest as of december   compared to one loan of thousand that was past due days and still accruing interest as of december  as part of our routine credit administration process  we engage an outside consulting firm to review our loan portfolio periodically 
the information from these reviews is used to monitor individual loans as well as to evaluate the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each period  management takes into consideration the historical loan losses experienced by the organization  current economic conditions affecting the borrowers ability to repay  the volume of loans  trends in delinquent  nonaccruing  and potential problem loans  and the quality of collateral securing loans 
after charging off all known losses which have been incurred in the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover its estimate of probable losses

however  management does not believe that the allowance for loan losses can be fragmented by category with any precision that would be useful to investors 
as such  the entire allowance is available for losses in any particular category  not withstanding this allocation 
the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses is based primarily upon those factors discussed above in computing the allowance for loan losses as a whole 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the allocation and actual results are not necessarily indicative of the exact category of potential loan losses

commercial loans are generally secured by accounts receivable  equipment and business assets 
commercial real estate is secured by income producing properties of all types 
construction loans are supported by projects which generally require an appropriate level of pre sales or pre leasing 
generally  all commercial and real estate loans have full recourse to the owners and or sponsors

during the year ended december   all of the sba securities were sold as part of management s strategic plan 
trading securities classified as level beginning in the third quarter of and continuing to the present time  the markets for these securities have behaved in a distressed and dysfunctional manner 
in evaluating the fair value of instruments held in our portfolios  we determined that the typical valuation techniques for the securities that contained a libor basis did not take into account the distressed and dysfunctional markets 
as such  we considered other factors such as typical spreads for the instruments and requested supplemental dealer pricing to determine fair value 
we believe this approach more accurately reflects the fair value of pcmo and agency securities

bankshares has recorded a liability of thousand as of december  for the present value of the potential differential between the contractual rental obligations and potential subleasing income 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in our effective tax rates were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  deferred taxes 
bankshares has recorded a deferred tax asset for the period ended december  in accordance with asc  income taxes formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the future realization of the tax benefit generated by net operating losses depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the applicable carryback and carryforward periods 
bankshares is in a three year cumulative loss position as of december  as a result of this position bankshares hired an independent consultant to analyze our deferred tax position and to consider the need for the valuation allowance 
the analysis considered various forms of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and if so to what degree a valuation allowance is warranted 
we considered positive evidence such as previous earnings patterns  the recent history of loan charge offs  nonperforming assets  oreo expenses  multiyear business projections and the potential realization of net operating loss  nol carry forwards within the prescribed time periods 
in addition  we considered tax planning strategies that would impact the timing and extent of taxable income 
the projected performance metrics over the period of nol recognition indicates that it is more likely than not that bankshares will have sufficient taxable income to recognize the deferred tax assets as of december  as part of the projected performance analysis  we stressed tested the performance in several different scenarios 
in all scenarios  bankshares generated sufficient taxable income to recognize the deferred tax asset over a reasonable time horizon 
furthermore  the nol embedded in the deferred tax assets is expected to be fully realized by therefore  bankshares has concluded that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is not necessary as of december  deposits we seek deposits within our market area by offering high quality customer service  by using technology to deliver deposit services effectively and by paying competitive interest rates 
at december   the deposit portfolio was million  an increase of million compared to the december  level of million 
the interest bearing deposits cost the bank for the year ended or basis points less than the year ended average cost of 
as key interest rates declined over the past year  we repriced deposits at a lower level 
in addition  the rates on time deposits have decreased substantially 
as we have the opportunity to reprice time deposits  we have realized significant interest rate savings 
management s strategic decision to increase the core deposits has shown positive results 
at december   our demand deposits were million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
average non interest bearing demand deposits were million at december  compared to average demand deposits of million at december  we are active users of wholesale brokered deposits 
we believe these types of funds offer a reliable stable source of funds for the bank 
frequently the interest rates associated with wholesale brokered deposits are significantly lower than general customer rates in the marketplace 
as of december   we had million of wholesale brokered certificates of deposit which is million lower than the december  level of million 
certain wholesale brokered deposits are accounted for on a fair value basis 
as of december   we had a single wholesale brokered deposit in the amount of million maturing in early accounted for on a fair value basis 
this type of funding is a tool to support the growth of the bank and liquidity needs 
as market conditions warrant and balance sheet needs dictate  we may continue to participate in the wholesale brokered certificate of deposit market 
as with any deposit product  we have potential risk for non renewal by the customer and or broker 
management is strategically reducing the reliance on brokered deposits for funding 
over the long term  management s strategic goal is to lower our wholesale brokered deposits and replace them with attractively priced local commercial and retail deposits 
at december   deposits were million  an increase of million from the december  level of million

the trust preferred securities are presented in the consolidated balance sheets of bankshares under the caption trust preferred capital notes 
bankshares records distributions payable on the trust preferred securities as an interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of issuance of the trust preferred securities was approximately thousand 
this cost was amortized over a five year period from the issue date and has been fully amortized 
the interest rate associated with the trust preferred securities is month libor plus subject to quarterly interest rate adjustments 
under the indenture governing the trust preferred securities  bankshares has the right to defer payments of interest for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods

we do not have any open repos with broker dealers 
the fhlb is a key source of funding for us 
during the periods presented  we have used overnight advances daily rate credit to support our short term liquidity needs 
on a longer term basis  we augment our funding portfolio with our two fhlb advances  one of which is accounted for on a fair value basis  and one of which is accounted for on a cost basis

in evaluating the fair value of funding instruments  we determined that the typical valuation techniques did not take into account the distressed and dysfunctional markets 
as such  we considered other factors such as typical spreads for the instruments  option adjusted spreads  swap curves  discounted cashflow models  previously observable non distressed valuations and bond issuance rates and spreads for investment and non investment grade instruments 
as of december  and december   the fair value of the long term fhlb advance accounted for on a fair value basis was million and million  respectively 
liquidity our overall asset liability strategy takes into account the need to maintain adequate liquidity to fund asset growth and deposit runoff 
our liquidity is impacted by the general growth of the bank  title company balances  the national and local mortgage refinance market  and the trading and investment portfolios 
we use a variety of tools to manage our liquidity 
these include pricing on loans and deposits  purchase or sale of investments  brokered deposits  the sale or participation of loans  and rates and fees on home mortgages 
in addition  we have a variety of credit facilities at our disposal 
our funding department monitors our overall position daily 
we can and will draw upon federal funds lines with correspondent banks  draw upon reverse repurchase agreement lines with correspondent banks and use fhlb advances 
our deposit customers frequently have lower deposit balances in the middle of the month  and balances generally rise toward the end of each month 
as such  we use wholesale funding techniques to support our overall balance sheet growth 
we provide temporary funding on presold loans originated by abmd 
the liquidity requirements vary based upon market and economic conditions 
the funds advanced on this line allow us to originate and hold mortgages until they are sold to third party investors 
in  advances for abmd averaged thousand  compared to advances averaging thousand in in  we do not anticipate any significant liquidity needs from the incidental mortgage banking activities

these off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees which would impact the overall liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept and or use these commitments 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the nature  business purpose and elements of risk involved with these off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk alm risk management 
we engage a consulting firm to model our short term and long term interest rate risk profile 
the model includes basic business assumptions  interest rates  repricing information and other relevant market data necessary to project our interest rate risk 
the board of directors has established interest rate risk limits for both short term and long term interest rate exposure 
on a periodic basis  management reports to the board of directors on our base interest rate risk profile and expectations of changes in the profiles based on certain interest rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity short term interest rate risk 
bankshares alm process evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
this analysis involves shocking the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of bankshares shorter term interest rate risk 
this analysis is accomplished by assuming a static balance sheet over a period of time with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under various rate scenarios 
these assumptions include prepayments  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant by bankshares 
the alm model results for december  are shown in the table below 
assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points  the results indicate bankshares would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by 
assuming a shift downward of basis points  bankshares would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by 
economic value of equity long term interest rate risk 
the economic value of equity process models the cashflows of financial instruments to maturity 
the model incorporates growth and pricing assumptions to develop a baseline eve 
the interest rates used in the model are then shocked for an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the results of the shocked model are compared to the baseline results to determine the percentage change in eve under the various scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the table below shows as of december  and alm model results under various interest rate shocks december  december  interest rate shocks nii eve nii eve bp bp bp bp all results above are within bankshares current interest rate risk policy guidelines 
interest rate gap 
in addition to the nii and eve models  management reviews our static gap position 
the cumulative negative gap position within one year was million  or of total assets  at december  while this measurement technique is common in the financial services industry  it has limitations and is not our sole tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
we do not believe this model accurately reflects bankshares true short term and long term interest rate exposure 
as an example  million of the investment and trading securities at december  are classified as greater than five years due to the contractual maturity of the instruments 
investment and trading securities are easily marketed and can be liquidated in a short period of time 
as a result  it is reasonable to consider a portion of  or perhaps all of  the million of investment and trading securities as the within three month category  which further suggests a more balanced short term interest rate position for bankshares 
the following table reflects our december  static interest rate gap position december  maturing or repricing within over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities trading securities loans held for sale loans interest bearing deposits federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposit accounts savings accounts iras time deposits  at fair value time deposits total interest bearing deposits fhlb long term advances  at fair value fhlb long term advances customer repurchase agreements other borrowings trust preferred capital notes total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap total assets during the next twelve months million of time deposits are due to reprice or mature 
the most recent repricing of the brokered deposit reflected an interest rate savings of several hundred basis points 
the impact of future repricings on interest expense will depend upon the interest rate environment at that time 
interest rate risk management summary 
as part of our interest rate risk management  we typically use the trading and investment portfolios and our wholesale funding instruments to balance our interest rate exposure 
there is no guarantee that the risk management techniques and balance sheet management strategies we employ will be effective in periods of rapid rate movements or extremely volatile periods 
we believe our strategies are prudent and within our policy guidelines in the base case of our modeling efforts as of december
