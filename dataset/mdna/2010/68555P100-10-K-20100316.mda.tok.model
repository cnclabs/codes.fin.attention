part i item business overview we operate a global commercial wireless messaging system optimized for narrowband communications 
our system consists of a global network of low earth orbit  or leo  satellites and accompanying ground infrastructure 
our two way communications system enables our customers and end users  which include large and established multinational businesses and government agencies  to track  monitor  control and communicate cost effectively with fixed and mobile assets located anywhere in the world 
in  we began providing terrestrial based cellular communication services through reseller agreements with major cellular wireless providers 
currently  our agreements with major cellular providers include gsm and cdma offerings in the united states and gsm services with significant coverage worldwide 
these terrestrial based communication services enable our customers who have higher bandwidth requirements to receive and send messages from communication devices based on terrestrial based technologies using the cellular providers wireless networks as well as from dual mode devices combining our satellite subscriber communicators with devices for terrestrial based technologies 
as a result  our customers are now able to integrate into their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from the cellular providers wireless networks 

table of contents our products and services enable our customers and end users to enhance productivity  reduce costs and improve security through a variety of commercial  government  and emerging homeland security applications 
we enable our customers and end users to achieve these benefits using a single global satellite technology standard for machine to machine and telematic  or mm  data communications 
our customers have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
examples of assets that are connected through our mm data communications system include trucks  trailers  railcars  containers  heavy equipment  fluid tanks  utility meters  pipeline monitoring equipment  marine vessels  and oil wells 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as caterpillar inc  caterpillar  doosan infracore america  hitachi construction machinery co  ltd  hitachi  hyundai heavy industries  komatsu ltd  komatsu  the manitowoc company and volvo construction equipment  ivars  such as ai a subsidiary of id systems  vars  such as xata corporation and american innovations  ltd  and government agencies  such as the us coast guard 
we currently have a contract to provide ais data to the us coast guard and offer the ais data service to other government and commercial customers 
further  we are working with system integrators and maritime information service providers for value added service and to facilitate the sales and distribution of our ais data 
in january  we entered into our first ais data license distribution agreement for commercial purposes with lloyd s register fairplay ltd lloyd s 
as a result  lloyd s has entered into agreements with several government agencies and corporate customers 
we will continue to work with additional candidates to address the various market sectors for ais data 
we believe we are the only commercially available satellite based ais data provider with capability beyond terrestrial based systems into the open seas 
through our mm data communications system  our customers and end users can send and receive information to and from any place in the world using low cost subscriber communicators and paying airtime costs that we believe are the lowest in the industry for global connectivity 
our customers can also use cellular terrestrial units  or wireless subscriber identity modules sims  for use with devices or equipment that enable the use of a cellular provider s wireless network  singularly or in conjunction with satellite services  to send and receive information from these devices 
we believe that there is no other satellite or terrestrial network currently in operation that can offer global two way wireless narrowband data service including coverage at comparable cost using a single technology standard worldwide  that also provides a parallel terrestrial network for data intensive applications 
we are currently authorized  either directly or indirectly  to provide our satellite communications services in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa and australia 
presently our unique mm data communications system is comprised of three elements i a constellation of leo satellites in multiple orbital planes between and miles above the earth operating in the very high frequency  or vhf  radio frequency spectrum  ii a network of related ground infrastructure  including gateway earth stations  four regional gateway control centers and a network control center in dulles  virginia  through which data sent to and from satellite subscriber communicators are routed and includes a communications node for terrestrial services through which data sent to and from terrestrial units are routed and iii a combination of satellite subscriber communicators and sims attached to a variety of fixed and mobile assets worldwide 
see the orbcomm communications system 
as of december   we had approximately  billable subscriber communicators activated on our communications system compared to approximately  billable subscriber communicators as of december   an increase of 
in  communications capability for three of the five quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite cds launched in june were lost 
as a result  we recognized non cash impairment charges of million in our consolidated statements of operations 
in december  we entered into a settlement and release agreement with the third party insurers with respect to our in orbit insurance policy for the five quick launch satellites and the cds and received million 
we recorded the million as an insurance recovery satellite network in our consolidated statements of operations 
see orbcomm communications system under system status satellite impairments and insurance recovery for a description of the anomalies and the insurance recovery 
in august  we placed in service the two remaining quick launch satellites for which we maintain communications capability 
these satellites are currently providing worldwide ais services and limited 
table of contents orbcomm messaging 
the similarity of these satellites to the failed satellites is believed to significantly reduce their expected useful lives and they are fully depreciated as of december  the remaining two quick launch satellites are equipped with an ais payload that provides redundant capabilities for our ais data service  and we will be relying on these satellites to provide ais data service 
if these satellites also fail  we will not be able to provide ais data service  including under existing contracts  unless we are able to procure other ais data service from third parties or until the launch of our ais payload equipped next generation satellites  scheduled as early as the end of our business strengths and competitive advantage we believe that our focus on mm data communications is unique in our industry and will enable us to achieve significant growth 
we believe no other satellite or terrestrial network currently in operation offers users global two way wireless narrowband data communications using a single global technology standard anywhere in the world at costs comparable to ours 
this provides us with a number of competitive advantages that we believe will help promote our success  including the following established global satellite network and proven technology 
we believe our global satellite network and technology enable us to offer superior products and services to the end users of our communications system in terms of comprehensive coverage  reliability and compatibility 
our global satellite network provides worldwide coverage  including in international waters  allowing end users to access our communications system in areas outside the coverage of terrestrial networks  such as cellular  paging  and other wireless networks 
our proven technology offers full two way mm data communication with acknowledgement of message receipt with minimal line of sight limitations and no performance issues during adverse weather conditions  which distinguishes us from other satellite communications systems 
our primary satellite orbital planes contain five to eight satellites each providing built in system redundancies in the event of a single satellite malfunction 
in addition  our satellite system uses a single global technology standard and eliminates the need for multiple network agreements and versions of hardware and software 
low cost structure 
we have a significant cost advantage over any potential new leo satellite system competitor with respect to our current satellite constellation  because we acquired the majority of our current network assets from orbcomm global lp  referred to as the predecessor company  and its subsidiaries out of bankruptcy for a fraction of their original cost 
in addition  because our leo satellites are relatively small and deployed into low earth orbit  the constellation is less expensive and easier to launch and maintain than larger leo satellites and large geostationary satellites 
we believe that we have less complex and less costly ground infrastructure and subscriber communication equipment than other satellite communications providers 
our low cost satellite system architecture enables us to provide global two way wireless narrowband data communication services to end users at prices that we believe are the lowest in the industry for global connectivity 
sole commercial satellite operator licensed in the vhf spectrum 
we are the sole commercial satellite operator licensed to operate in the mhz vhf spectrum by the fcc or  to our knowledge  any other national spectrum or radio telecommunications regulatory agency in the world 
the spectrum that we use was allocated globally by the international telecommunication union  or itu  for use by satellite fleets such as ours to provide mobile data communications service 
we are currently authorized  either directly or indirectly  to provide our data communications service in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  and australia 
vhf spectrum has inherent advantages for mm data communications over systems using shorter wavelength signals 
the vhf signals used to communicate between our satellites and subscriber communicators are not affected by weather and are less dependent on line of sight access to our satellites than other satellite communications systems 
in addition  our longer wavelength signals enable our satellites to communicate reliably over longer distances at lower power levels 
higher power requirements of commercial satellite systems in other spectrum bands are a significant factor in their higher cost and technical complexity 
significant market lead over satellite based competitors 
we believe that we have a significant market lead in providing mm data communications services that meet the coverage and cost requirements in the rapidly developing asset management and supply chain markets 
the process required to establish a new competing 
table of contents satellite based system with the advantages of a vhf system includes obtaining regulatory permits to launch and operate satellites and to provide communications services  and the design  development  construction and launch of a communications system 
we believe that a minimum of five years and significant investments in time and resources would be required for another satellite based mm data communications service provider to develop the capability to offer comparable services 
our vars and ivars have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
these applications often require substantial time and financial investment to develop for commercial use 
key distribution and oem customer relationships 
our strategic relationships with key distributors and oems have enabled us to streamline our sales and distribution channels and shift much of the risk and cost of developing and marketing applications to others 
we have established strategic relationships with key service providers  such as asset intelligence and xata corporation  a leading provider of tracking solutions for the trucking industry  including to penske corporation  the leading truck leasing company in the united states  and major oems  such as caterpillar  hitachi  komatsu  and volvo 
we believe our close relationships with these distributors and oems allows us to work closely with them at all stages of application development  from planning and design through implementation of our mm data communications services  and to benefit from their industry specific expertise 
by fostering these strong relationships with distributors and oems  we believe that once we have become so integrated into our customer s planning  development  and implementation process  and their equipment  we anticipate it will be more difficult to displace us or our communication services 
in addition  the fixed and mobile assets which are tracked  monitored  controlled  and communicated with by these customers generally have long useful lives and the cost of replacing our communications equipment with an alternative service provider s equipment could be prohibitive for a large numbers of assets 
reliable  low cost subscriber communicators 
there are multiple manufacturers that build subscriber communicators for our network  including our subsidiary stellar satellite communications  ltd 
stellar and independent third party manufacturers such as quake global  inc quake  digi international  digi and sierra wireless  inc sierra wireless 
through stellar we have an arrangement with delphi corporation that provides us with industrial scale manufacturing capability for the supply of low cost  reliable  iso certified  automotive grade subscriber communicators 
as a result of these manufacturing relationships  technological advances and higher volumes  we have significantly reduced the selling price of our subscriber communicators from approximately per unit in to below per unit in volume in in addition  the cost of communications components necessary for our subscriber communicators to operate in the vhf band is relatively low as they are based on readily available fm radio components 
dual mode devices are being built by several manufacturers that combine other communication technologies with satellite technology and will be offered to the market at what we believe will be industry low prices 
our strategy our strategy is to leverage our business strengths and key competitive advantages to increase the number of subscriber communicators activated on our mm data communications system  both in existing and new markets 
we are focused on increasing our market share of customers with the potential for a high number of connections with lower usage applications 
we believe that the service revenue associated with each additional subscriber communicator activated on our communications system will more than offset the low incremental cost of adding such subscriber communicator to our system and  as a result  positively impact our results of operations 
we currently provide services through reseller agreements allowing customers to utilize other major cellular providers networks offering gsm and cdma technologies to be intergraded into their applications 
we plan to continue to target multinational companies and government agencies to increase substantially our penetration of what we believe is a significant and growing addressable market 
additionally  we seek to leverage our new business in ais services 
to achieve our objectives  we are pursuing the following business strategies expand our low cost  multi channel marketing and distribution network of resellers 
we intend to increase further the number of resellers that develop  market and implement their applications together with our communications services and subscriber communicators to end users 
we are also focused on increasing the 
table of contents number of oem and distributor relationships with leading companies that own  manage  or operate fixed or mobile assets 
we are seeking to recruit resellers with industry knowledge to develop applications that could be used for industries or markets that we do not currently serve 
resellers invest their own capital developing applications compatible with our system  and they typically act as their own agents and systems integrators when marketing these applications to end users  without the need for significant investment by us 
as a result  we have established a low cost marketing and distribution model that is both easily scalable by adding resellers or large scale asset deployers  and allows us to penetrate markets without incurring substantial research and development costs or sales and marketing costs 
expand our international markets 
our international growth strategy is to open new markets outside the united states by obtaining regulatory authorizations and developing markets for our mm data communications services to be sold in regions where the market opportunity for our oem customers and resellers is greatest 
we are currently authorized to provide our data communications services in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  and australia  directly or indirectly through our multiple international licensees and country representatives 
we are currently working with ivars who  generally  subject to certain regulatory restrictions  have the right to market and sell their applications anywhere our communications services are offered 
we seek to enter into agreements with strong distributors in each region 
our regional distributors  which include country representatives and international licensees  obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations and develop local markets directly or by recruiting local vars 
in some international markets where distribution channels are in the early stages of development  we seek to bring together vars who have developed well tested applications with local distributors to create localized solutions and accelerate the adoption of our mm data communications services 
in addition  we have made efforts to strengthen the financial positions of certain of our regional distributors  including several  such as orbcomm europe llc  who were former licensees of the predecessor company left weakened by its bankruptcy  through restructuring transactions whereby we obtained greater operating control over such regional distributors 
we believe that by strengthening the financial condition of  and our operating control over  these established regional distributors  they will be better positioned to promote and distribute our products and services and enable us to achieve our market potential in the relevant regions 
further reduce subscriber communicator costs and improve functionality of communicators 
we are working with our subscriber communicator manufacturers to further reduce the cost of our subscriber communicators  as well as to develop technological advances  including further reductions in size  improvements in power management efficiency  increased reliability  and enhanced capabilities 
our ability to offer our customers less expensive subscriber communicators that are smaller  more efficient and more reliable is key to our ability to provide a complete low cost solution to our customers and end users 
additionally  some suppliers have been developing a dual mode device that will allow customers to integrate both a satellite and terrestrial communication component into a single device 
reduce network latency 
following the launch of our next generation satellites  we expect to reduce the time lags in delivering messages and data  or network latency  in most regions of the world 
we believe this will improve the quality and coverage of our system and enable us to increase our customer base 
introduce new features and services 
we will continue to develop and introduce new features and services to expand our customer base and increase our revenues 
for example  as a result of providing terrestrial based cellular communication services  our customers are now able to integrate in their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from combined satellite and cellular technologies 
we have upgraded the technology capabilities of our network operations center to deliver both satellite and terrestrial messages through our ground infrastructure to the ultimate destination 
in addition  we have recently developed a broadcast capability that allows large numbers of subscriber communicators to receive a single message simultaneously 
this represents an efficient delivery mechanism to address large populations of subscribers with a single message  such as weather data broadcasts  widespread alert notifications and demand response applications for electric utilities 
we believe that subscriber communicator technology advances  such as dual mode devices  will broaden our addressable market by providing attractive combinations of bandwidth and coverage at a 
table of contents reasonable price 
dual mode devices combine a satellite subscriber communicator with a cellular network subscriber communicator for higher bandwidth applications not typical of orbcomm s applications 
dual mode devices can also be used as a back channel service for terrestrial or satellite based broadcast only networks 
expand ais services 
in june  we launched satellites equipped with ais capability  to augment our existing commercial constellation 
ais is a shipboard broadcast system that transmits a vessel s identification and position to aid navigation and improve maritime safety 
current terrestrial based ais systems provide only limited shore coverage and are not able to provide global open ocean coverage 
using our communications system  customers will have access to ais data well beyond coastal regions in a cost effective and timely fashion 
we currently have a contract to provide ais data to the us coast guard and offer the ais data service to other government and commercial customers 
further  we will be working with system integrators and maritime information service providers for value added service and to facilitate the sales and distribution of our ais data 
in january  we entered into our first ais data license distribution agreement for commercial purposes with lloyd s 
we will continue to work with additional candidates to address the various market sectors for ais data and believe orbcomm is the only commercially available provider of satellite based ais data reaching beyond coastal access into the open water 
provide comprehensive technical support  customer service and quality control 
we have allocated additional resources to provide customer support for training  integration and testing in order to assist our vars and other distributors in the roll out of their applications and to enhance end user acquisition and retention 
we provide our var and oem customers with access to customer support technicians 
we also deploy our technicians to our var and oem customers to facilitate the integration of our mm data communications system with their applications during the planning  development and implementation processes and to certify that these applications are compatible with our system 
our support personnel include professionals with application development  in house laboratory  and hardware design and testing capabilities 
industry overview increasingly  businesses and governments face the need to track  control  monitor and communicate with fixed and mobile assets that are located throughout the world 
at the same time  these assets increasingly incorporate microprocessors  sensors and other devices that can provide a variety of information about the asset s location  condition  operation and environment and are capable of responding to external commands and queries 
as these intelligent devices proliferate  we believe that the need to establish two way communications with these devices is greater than ever 
the owners and operators of these intelligent devices are seeking low cost and efficient communications systems that will enable them to communicate with these devices 
we operate in the machine to machine and telematics  or mm  industry  which includes various types of communications systems that enable intelligent machines  devices and fixed or mobile assets to communicate information from the machine  device or fixed or mobile asset to and from back office information systems of the businesses and government agencies that track  monitor  control and communicate with them 
these mm data communications systems integrate a number of technologies and cross several different industries  including computer hardware and software systems  positioning systems  terrestrial and satellite communications networks and information technologies such as data hosting and report generation 
there are three main components in any mm data communications system fixed or mobile assets 
intelligent or trackable assets include devices and sensors that collect  measure  record or otherwise gather data about themselves or their environment to be used  analyzed or otherwise disseminated to other machines  applications or human operators and come in many forms  including devices and sensors that report the location  speed and fuel economy data from trucks and locomotives  monitor the location and condition of trailers  railcars and marine shipping containers  
table of contents report operating data and usage for heavy equipment  monitor fishing vessels to enforce government regulations regarding geographic and seasonal restrictions  report energy consumption from a utility meter  monitor corrosion in a pipeline  monitor fluid levels in oil storage tanks  measure water delivery in agricultural pipelines  and monitor environmental conditions in agricultural facilities 
communications network 
the communications network enables a connection to take place between the fixed or mobile asset and the back office systems and users of that asset s data 
the proliferation of terrestrial and satellite based wireless networks has enabled the creation of a variety of mm data communications applications 
networks that are being used to deliver mm data include terrestrial communications networks  such as cellular  radio paging and wifi networks  and satellite communications networks  utilizing low earth orbit or geosynchronous satellites 
back office application or user 
data collected from a remote asset is used in a variety of ways with applications that allow the end user to track  monitor  control and communicate with these assets with a greater degree of control and with much less time and expense than would be required to do so manually 
market opportunity commercial transportation large trucking and trailer leasing companies require applications that report location  engine diagnostic data  driver performance  fuel consumption  compliance  rapid decelerations  fuel taxes  driver logs and zone adherence in order to manage their truck fleets more safely and efficiently and to improve truck and trailer utilization 
truck and trailer fleet owners and operators  as well as truck and trailer oems  are increasingly integrating mm data communications systems into their trucks and trailers 
as trucks and trailer tracking applications phase out the use of older analog cellular wireless networks  end users will need to migrate to alternative communications systems and we expect that an increasing number of customers will be seeking long term solutions for their mm data communications needs as they make their replacement decisions 
trailer tracking represents a significantly larger potential market as we estimate that there are approximately three trailers to every truck 
the trailer market also requires additional applications  such as cargo sensor reporting  load monitoring  control of refrigeration systems and door alarms 
future regulations may require position tracking of specific types of cargo  such as hazardous materials  and could also increase trailer tracking market opportunities 
the railcar market also requires many of these same applications and many trailer applications using mm data communications system can readily be translated to the railcar market 
heavy equipment heavy equipment fleet owners and leasing companies seeking to improve fleet productivity and profitability require applications that report diagnostic information  location including for purposes of geo fencing  time of use information  emergency notification  driver usage and maintenance alerts for their heavy equipment  which may be geographically dispersed  often in remote  difficult to reach locations 
using mm data communications systems  heavy equipment fleet operators can remotely manage the productivity and mechanical condition of their equipment fleets  potentially lowering operating costs through preventive maintenance 
oems can also use mm applications to better anticipate the maintenance and spare parts needs of their customers  expanding the market for more higher margin spare parts orders for the oems 
heavy equipment oems are increasingly integrating mm data communications systems as standardized into their equipment at the factory or offering them as add on options through certified after market dealers 

table of contents since the heavy equipment market is dominated by a small number of oems  mm data communications service providers targeting this market segment focus on building relationships with these oems  such as caterpillar  komatsu  hitachi and volvo 
fixed asset monitoring companies with widely dispersed fixed assets require a means of collecting data from remote assets to monitor productivity  minimize downtime and realize other operational benefits  as well as managing and controlling the functions of such assets  for example  the remote operation of valves and electrical switches 
mm data communications systems can provide industrial companies with applications for automated meter reading  oil and gas storage tank monitoring  pipeline monitoring and environmental monitoring  which can reduce operating costs for these companies  including labor costs  fuel costs  and the expense of on site monitoring and maintenance 
marine vessels marine vessels have a need for satellite based communications due to the absence of reliable terrestrial based coverage more than a few miles offshore 
mm data communications systems may offer features and functions to luxury recreational marine vessels and commercial fishing vessels  such as onboard diagnostics and other marine telematics  alarms  requests for assistance  security  location reporting and tracking  two way messaging  catch data and weather reports 
in addition  owners and operators of commercial fishing and other marine vessels are increasingly subject to regulations governing  among other things  commercial fishing seasons and geographic limitations  vessel tracking  safety systems  and resource management and protection using various mm communications systems 
government and homeland security governments worldwide are seeking to address the global terror threat by monitoring land borders and hazardous materials  as well as marine vessels and containers 
in addition  modern military and public safety forces use a variety of applications  particularly in supply chain management  logistics and support  which could incorporate our products and services 
mm communications systems can be used in applications to address infiltration across land borders  for example  monitoring seismic sensors placed along the border to detect incursions 
increasingly  there is a need to monitor maritime vessels for homeland security and mm data communications systems could be used in applications to address homeland security requirements  such as tracking and monitoring these vessels and containers 
we have begun to leverage our investment in ais technology to resell ais data collected by our network to other maritime services and governmental agencies 
further expansion of the ais business has been driven by our ais distribution agreements for commercial purposes 
we are seeking to expand our commercial activities with other distribution partners in the future 
consumer transportation automotive companies are seeking a means to address the growing need for safety systems in passenger vehicles and to broadcast a single message to multiple vehicles at one time 
within the automotive market  there is no single communications technology that satisfies the need for coverage  high reliability and low cost 
an example of an automotive safety application is a system that has the ability to detect and report the deployment of a vehicle s airbag  triggering the dispatch of an ambulance  tow truck or other necessary response personnel 
the terrestrial cellular communications systems currently employed have substantial dead zones  where network coverage is not available  and are difficult to manage globally 
with emerging technology  satellite based automotive safety systems may be able to provide near real time message delivery with minimal network latencies  thereby providing a viable alternative to cellular based systems 
while our system currently has latency limitations which make it impractical for us to address this market fully  we believe that our existing network may be used with dual mode devices  combining our subscriber communicators with communications devices for cellular networks  allowing our communications services to function as an effective back up system by filling the coverage gaps in current cellular or wireless networks used in consumer transportation applications 
in addition  we may undertake additional capital expenditures beyond our 
table of contents current capital plan in order to expand our satellite constellation and lower our latencies to the level that addresses the requirements of resellers and oems developing applications for this market if we believe the economic returns justify such an investment 
we believe we can supplement our satellite constellation within the lead time required to integrate applications using our communications service into the automotive oem product development cycle 
products and services our principal products and services are satellite based data communications services and product sales from subscriber communicators 
in  we commenced terrestrial based cellular communications services  which consist of reselling airtime using cellular providers wireless technology networks  and product sales from cellular wireless sims for use with devices or equipment that enable the use of the cellular providers wireless networks for data communications 
our communications services are used by businesses and government agencies that are engaged in tracking  monitoring  controlling  or communicating with fixed or mobile assets globally 
our low cost  industrially rated subscriber communicators are embedded into many different assets for use with our system 
our products and services are combined with industry or customer specific applications developed by our vars  which are sold to their end user customers 
for our satellite based data and terrestrial based cellular communications services  we do not generally market to end users directly  instead  we utilize a cost effective sales and marketing strategy of partnering with resellers such as vars  ivars and country representatives 
these resellers  which are our direct customers  market to end users 
satellite communications services we provide global two way mm data communications services through our satellite based system 
we focus our communications services on narrowband data applications 
these data messages are typically sent by a remote subscriber communicator through our satellite system to our ground facilities for forwarding through an appropriate terrestrial communications network to the ultimate destination 
our system  typically combined with industry or customer specific applications developed by our resellers  permits a wide range of fixed and mobile assets to be tracked  monitored  controlled  and communicated with from a central point 
we derive subscription based recurring revenue from our resellers typically based upon the number of subscriber communicators activated on  and the amount of data transmitted through  our communications system 
customers pay a range of monthly service charges to access our communications system generally in addition to a one time provisioning fee  which we believe are the lowest price points in the market 
terrestrial cellular communication services these communication services include gsm and cdma offerings that support higher bandwidth applications that are not typical for an orbcomm satellite application 
these data messages are sent by sims  which are routed through the cellular providers wireless networks to our ground facilities and forwarded to the ultimate destination in real time 
these services commenced in the third quarter of we derive subscription based recurring revenue from resellers typically based upon the number of sims activated on  and the amount of data transmitted through  the cellular providers wireless networks

all of these ge equipment services divisions directly or indirectly sell applications utilizing our mm data communications services and subscriber communicators manufactured by stellar 
as a result  ge equipment services has a number of different sales channels for the distribution of our asset monitoring and tracking products either to third party end users or to other ge divisions who are end users 
ge rail services is also integrating our mm data communications system into its railwise application for railcars 
ge equipment services european division offers railwise 
penske truck leasing also uses our mm data communications system to monitor tractor trailers  and other ge businesses are monitoring many different types of assets  including ge healthcare s portable mri machines  locomotives for ge rail  tractor trailers for penske truck leasing  and portable electric generators for ge energy 
ai one of our largest customers in was ai  which is dedicated to mm data communications applications and which renewed its ivar agreement with us through 
table of contents on april   we entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with ai with respect to the supply agreement dated october  between our stellar subsidiary and ai the agreement 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we received million as settlement for ge s obligation under the agreement 
we and ai terminated the agreement and all parties respective obligations relating to it  and released each other from any claims relating to their obligations arising under the agreement  except for certain obligations related to warranties  indemnities  confidentiality and intellectual property 
concurrent with the settlement agreement  we and ai entered into the services agreement the services agreement with a term of january  through december   pursuant to which we and ai agree to expand the scope of services provided or that may in the future be provided to ai to include other satellite  cellular or dual mode cellular plus satellite data communications services  in addition to the low earth orbit satellite based data communication services the low earth services under the ivar agreement

us coast guard in may  we were awarded a contract by the us coast guard the uscg to develop and demonstrate the ability to receive  collect  and forward ais data over our satellite system the concept validation project 
ais is a shipboard broadcast system that transmits a marine vessel s identification and position to aid navigation and improve maritime safety 
the international maritime organization has mandated the use of ais on all safety of life at sea solas vessels  which are vessels over tons 
the cds carries an ais receiver in addition to our standard communications payload 
also we have included the ais capability in our quick launch satellites and intend to outfit our next generation satellites with the ais capability 
we believe we are the only commercially available ais data provider with capability beyond terrestrial based systems reaching into the open seas 
current terrestrial based ais networks provide limited coverage and are not able to provide the expanded coverage capability desired by the uscg 
by using our remaining two quick launch satellites  the uscg can collect and process ais data well beyond the coast of the united states in a cost effective and timely fashion 
the uscg has paid us the full contract price of million  primarily for the construction and launch of an ais enabled demonstration satellite 
these payments are included in deferred revenue 
additional amounts are payable now that the uscg has accepted the subsequent post launch ais data transmission services and maintenance options 
on april   we and the uscg entered into an amendment to the agreement extending the definitive launch date to august  in consideration for agreeing to the extend the launch date  we agreed to provide the uscg with all ais data from each of the quick launch satellites being launched with the cds  to the extent the satellites are providing service  for continuous days  which commenced on february  at no additional cost 
in addition  the uscg will have certain intellectual property rights over the ais data received by the ais receivers aboard the quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite solely during a day evaluation period to share only with other us government agencies  provided that during a day evaluation period we were permitted to use the ais data from the quick launch satellites in connection with our other programs 
on june   the cds and five quick launch satellites were launched 
in july  we began transmitting ais test data to the uscg 
in august  the uscg accepted the ais data and elected to receive initial post 
table of contents launch maintenance for million and ais data transmission services for million over the initial term of fourteen months 
on september   the uscg increased the initial amount of the usage for the ais data transmission services for an additional million 
in  communications capability for three of the quick launch satellites and the cds has been lost 
in august  we placed in service the remaining two quick launch satellites for which we maintain communications capability 
these satellites are providing worldwide ais services 
in august  the uscg elected to exercise the subsequent post launch maintenance and ais data transmissions services options for million and million  respectively  to continue receiving service from the remaining two quick launch satellites 
sales  marketing and distribution we generally market our satellite and terrestrial communications services through resellers ie  vars and internationally through ivars  international licensees and country representatives 
the following chart shows how our low cost  multi channel distribution network is structured flow chart vars and ivars 
we are currently working with a number of vars and ivars and seek to continue to increase the number of our vars and ivars as we expand our business 
the role of the var or ivar is to develop tailored applications that utilize our system and then market these applications  through non exclusive licenses  to specific  targeted vertical markets 
vars and ivars are responsible for establishing retail pricing  collecting airtime revenue from end users and for providing customer service and support to end users 
our relationship with a var or ivar may be direct or indirect and may be governed by a reseller agreement between us  the international licensee or country representative  on the one hand  and the var or ivar on the other hand  that establishes the var s or ivar s responsibilities with respect to the business  as well as the cost of satellite service to the var or ivar 
vars and ivars are responsible for their own development and sales costs 
vars and ivars typically have unique industry knowledge  which permits them to develop applications targeted for a particular industry or market 
our vars and ivars have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
these applications often require significant time and financial investment to develop for commercial use 
by leveraging these investments  we are able to minimize our own research and development costs  increase the scale of our business without increasing overhead and diversify our business risk among many sales channels 
vars and ivars pay fees for access to our system based on the number of subscriber communicators they have activated on the network and on the amount of data transmitted 
vars and ivars are also generally required to pay a one time fee for each subscriber communicator activated on our system and for other administrative charges 
vars and ivars then typically bill end users based upon the full value of the application and are responsible for customer care to the end user 
generally  subject to certain regulatory restrictions  the ivar arrangement allows us to enter into a single agreement with any given ivar and allows the ivars to pay directly to us a single price on a single monthly invoice in a single currency for worldwide service  regardless of the territories they are selling into  thereby avoiding the need to negotiate prices with individual international licensees and country representatives 
we pay our international licensees and country representatives a commission on revenues received from ivars from each subscriber communicator activated in a specific territory 
the terms of our reseller agreements with ivars typically provide for a three year initial term that is renewable for additional three year terms 
under these agreements  the ivar is 
table of contents responsible for promoting their applications in their respective territory  providing sales forecasts and provisioning information to us  collecting airtime revenue from end users and paying invoices rendered by us 
in addition  ivars are responsible for providing customer support 
international licensees and country representatives 
we generally market and distribute our services outside the united states and canada primarily through international licensees and country representatives  including through our subsidiary  satcom international group plc  which has entered into country representative agreements with our affiliated international licensee  orbcomm europe llc  covering the united kingdom  ireland and switzerland and a service license agreement covering substantially all of the countries of the middle east and a significant number of countries of central asia 
in addition  orbcomm europe and satcom have entered into an agreement obligating orbcomm europe to enter into a country representative agreement for turkey with satcom  if the current country representative agreement for turkey expires or is terminated for any reason 
we rely on these third parties to establish business in their respective territories  including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals  as well as managing local vars 
in addition  we believe that our international licensees and country representatives  through their local expertise  are able to operate in these territories in a more efficient and cost effective manner 
we currently have agreements covering over 
countries and territories through our multiple international licensees and country representatives 
as we seek to expand internationally  we expect to continue to enter into agreements with additional international licensees and country representatives  particularly in asia and africa 
international licensees and country representatives are generally required to make the system available in their designated regions to vars and ivars 
in territories with multiple countries  it is typical for our international licensees to appoint country representatives 
country representatives are sub licensees within the territory 
they perform tasks assigned by the international licensee 
in return  the international licensees are responsible for  among other things  operating and maintaining the necessary gateway earth stations within their designated regions  obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to provide our services in their designated regions  and marketing and distributing our services in such regions 
country representatives are entities that obtain local regulatory approvals and establish local marketing channels to provide orbcomm services in their designated countries 
as a us company  we are not legally qualified to hold a license to operate as a telecommunications provider in some countries and our country representative program permits us to serve many international markets 
in some cases  a country representative enters into a joint venture with us 
in other cases  the country representative is an independent entity that pays us fees based on the amount of airtime usage on our system 
country representatives may distribute our services directly or through a distribution network made up of local vars 
subject to certain limitations  our service license agreements grant to the international licensee  among other things  the exclusive right subject to our right to appoint ivars to market services using our satellite system in a designated region and a limited right to use certain of our proprietary technologies and intellectual property 
international licensees and country representatives who are appointed by us pay fees for access to the system in their region based on the number of subscriber communicators activated on the network in their territory and the amount of data transmitted through the system 
we may adjust pricing in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements 
we pay international licensees and country representatives a commission based on the revenue we receive from ivars that is generated from subscriber communicators that ivars activate in their territories 
we have entered into or are negotiating new service license or country representative agreements with several international licensees and country representatives  respectively  including former licensees of the predecessor company and new groups consisting of affiliates of former licensees of the predecessor company 
until new service license agreements are in place  we will operate in those regions where a licensee has not been contracted either pursuant to letters of intent entered into with such licensee or pursuant to the terms of the original agreements with the predecessor company  as is currently the case in south korea and morocco 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in negotiating new service license or country representative agreements 

table of contents competition currently  we are the only commercial provider of below ghz band  or little leo  two way data satellite services optimized for narrowband 
however  we are not the only provider of data communication services  and we face competition from a variety of existing and proposed products and services 
competing service providers can be divided into three main categories terrestrial tower based  low earth orbit mobile satellite and geostationary satellite service providers 
terrestrial tower based networks while terrestrial tower based networks are capable of providing services at costs comparable to ours  they lack seamless global coverage 
terrestrial coverage is dependent on the location of tower transmitters  which are generally located in densely populated areas or heavily traveled routes 
several data and messaging markets  such as long haul trucking  railroads  oil and gas  agriculture  utility distribution  and heavy construction  have significant activity in sparsely populated areas with limited or no terrestrial coverage 
in addition  there are many different terrestrial systems and protocols  so service providers must coordinate with multiple carriers to enable service in different coverage areas 
in some geographic areas  terrestrial tower based networks have gaps in their coverage and may require a back up system to fill in such coverage gaps 
beginning in and continuing today  we have entered into re seller agreements with several major cellular wireless providers in the us and the rest of the world to provide terrestrial communications services to our customers who want these services using the wireless communications networks of these cellular wireless providers 
low earth orbit mobile satellite service providers low earth orbit mobile satellite service providers operating above the ghz band  or big leo systems  can provide data connectivity with global coverage that can compete with our communications services 
to date  the primary focus of big leo satellite service providers has been primarily on circuit switched communications tailored for voice traffic  which  by its nature  is less efficient for the transfer of short data messages because they require a dedicated circuit that is time and bandwidth intensive when compared to the amount of information transmitted 
however  big leo satellite service providers have shifted their focus more on mm data communications 
these systems entail significantly higher costs for the satellite fleet operator and the end users 
our principal big leo mobile satellite service competitors are globalstar  inc and iridium communications inc 
geostationary satellite service providers geostationary satellite system operators can offer services that compete with ours 
certain pan regional or global systems operating in the l or s bands  such as inmarsat plc  are designed and licensed for mobile high speed data and voice services 
however  the equipment cost and service fees for narrowband  or small packet  data communications with these systems is significantly more expensive than for our system 
some companies  such as the omnitracs subsidiary of qualcomm incorporated  which uses ses s satellites operating in c and ku bands  have developed technologies to use their bandwidth for mobile applications 
we believe that the equipment cost and service fees for narrowband data communications using these systems are also significantly higher than ours  and that these geostationary providers cannot offer global service with competitive communications devices and costs 
in addition  these geostationary systems have other limitations  such as requiring a clear line of sight between the communicator equipment and the satellite  are affected by adverse weather or atmospheric conditions  and are vulnerable to catastrophic single point failures of their satellites with limited backup options 
research and development we are able to minimize our research and development costs by leveraging the investments made by our var s and ivar s 
see sales marketing and distribution 
we have incurred no research and development costs in  and 
table of contents backlog we have no significant backlog as of december  the backlog of subscriber communicators at our stellar subsidiary as of december  was  units  or approximately million  which excludes  units that ai had committed to purchase under the agreement see key strategic relationships general electric company  under which they were in default 
in addition  our pre bill backlog  which represents subscriber communicators activated at the customer s request for testing prior to putting the units into actual service  was  units as of december   as compared with a pre bill backlog of  as of december  we believe that the majority of units that comprise our pre bill backlog will be billable within a one year period 
we are not able to determine pre bill backlog in dollars because the service costs for each subscriber communicator varies by customer 
orbcomm communications system overview our data communications services are provided by our proprietary two way satellite system  which is designed to provide near real time and store and forward communication to and from both fixed and mobile assets around the world 
during the third quarter of  we began providing terrestrial cellular wireless data communications services through a reseller agreement with a cellular wireless provider 
our system has three operational segments the space segment  which consists of a constellation of operational satellites in multiple orbital planes between and miles above the earth four primary planes of five to eight satellites each operating in the vhf band  the ground and control segment  which consists of fifteen gateway earth stations  four regional gateway control centers and a network control center in dulles  virginia  through which data sent to and from satellite subscriber communicators are routed  including a communications node for terrestrial services through which data sent to and from terrestrial units are routed  and the subscriber segment  which consists of satellite subscriber communicators and cellular terrestrial units  or wireless modems incorporating sims used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and our system 
for most applications using our system  data is generated by end user developed software and is currently transferred to either a subscriber communicator  or a gprs based wireless device using a sim on the cellular provider s wireless network 
in the case of the satellite subscriber communicator selection  data is encapsulated and transmitted to the next satellite that comes into view 
the data is then routed by the satellite to the next gateway earth station it successfully connects to  which in turn forwards it to the associated gateway control center 
within the gateway control center  the data is processed and forwarded to its ultimate destination after acknowledgement to the satellite subscriber communicator that the entire data message content has been received 
in the case of the cellular device  a message is routed through the cellular provider s wireless network gateway gprs support node ggsn  to the associated orbcomm access point name apn located within the gateway control center  and forwarded to its ultimate destination in real time 
the destination may be another subscriber communicator  a corporate resource management system  any personal or business internet e mail address  a pager or a cellular phone 
in addition  data can be sent in the reverse direction a feature which is utilized by many applications to remotely control assets 
when a satellite is in view of and connected to a gateway earth station at the time it receives data from a subscriber communicator  a transmission is initiated to transfer the data in what we refer to as near real time mode 
in this near real time mode  the data is passed immediately from a subscriber communicator to a satellite and onto the gateway earth station to the appropriate control center for routing to its final destination 
when a satellite is not immediately in view of a gateway earth station  the satellite switches to a store and forward mode to accept data in globalgram format 
these globalgrams are short messages consisting of data of up to approximately bytes and are stored in a satellite until it can connect through a gateway earth station to 
table of contents the appropriate control center 
the automatic mode switching capability between near real time service and globalgram service allows the satellite network to be available to the satellite subscriber communicators worldwide regardless of their location 
end user data can be delivered by the gateway control center in a variety of formats 
communications options include private and public communications links to the control center  such as standard internet  dedicated telecommunications company and vpn based transports 
data can also be received via standard e mail protocols with full delivery acknowledgement as requested  or via our internet protocol gateway interface in html and xml formats 
wherever possible  our system makes use of existing  mature technologies and conforms to internationally accepted standards for electronic mail and web technologies 
for wireless based applications  the orbcomm and cellular providers apn provides the flexibility for developers to control the end to end connectivity as needed for the application  using customizable tcp  udp  and sms services 
this allows existing legacy applications to be retrofit and completely new system designs to be implemented to integrate existing as well as new end user business applications 
system status satellite impairments and insurance recovery on june   the cds and five quick launch satellites were launched 
due to continued delays associated with the construction of the final quick launch satellite  we are retaining it for future deployment 
since launch  communications capability for three of the quick launch satellites and the cds has been lost as described below 
in august  we placed into service the remaining two quick launch satellites for which we maintain communications capability 
on february   one quick launch satellite experienced a power system anomaly that subsequently resulted in a loss of contact with the satellite 
after consultation with ohb and our own engineers  we believe that after an extended period of no communication with the satellite  the satellite was not recoverable 
a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of this satellite of million was recognized during the first quarter of on july   another quick launch satellite experienced a gateway transmitter anomaly that resulted in a loss of contact with the satellite by our ground control systems 
after consulting with our engineers  we believe that the gateway transmitter will not be recovered  resulting in an inability to provide orbcomm messaging and ais data services by this satellite 
a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of this satellite of million was recognized during the third quarter of on august   another quick launch satellite experienced a power system anomaly 
subsequently  on august   the cds also experienced an anomaly with its power system 
these anomalies resulted in a loss of contact with the satellites 
after consulting with ohb and our own engineers  we believe that after such an extended period of no communication with the satellites  it is unlikely that the satellites will be recovered based on its experience with earlier satellites with which contact was similarly lost 
a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of these satellites of million was recorded for a total impairment charge of million recognized during the third quarter of during the quarter ended december   we accrued additional expense of million relating to the quick launch satellites which is recorded in impairment charges satellite network 
the loss of these satellites can result in longer latencies in transmitting messages but is not otherwise expected to have a material adverse effect on the current communications service as the satellites were not in full operational service 
the remaining two quick launch satellites are equipped with an ais payload that provides redundant capabilities for our ais data service  and we will be relying on these satellites to provide ais data service 
these satellites are providing limited orbcomm messaging and worldwide ais services 
these satellites are experiencing attitude control system anomalies which result in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected 
these pointing errors result in reduced power generation  improper satellite spacing within the orbital plane and reduced communications capabilities 
one of these satellites has an intermittent flight computer anomaly and a power system anomaly which has significantly reduced its availability 
the similarity of these 
table of contents satellites to the failed satellites described below is believed to significantly reduce their expected useful lives 
as a result  these two satellites have been fully depreciated as of december  if these satellites also fail  we will not be able to provide ais data service  including under existing contracts  unless we are able to procure other ais data service from third parties or until the launch of our ais payload equipped next generation satellites  scheduled as early as the end of we purchased an in orbit insurance policy that covers the total loss or constructive total loss of the cds and five quick launch satellites during the coverage period that ended on june  under the terms of the policy  a satellite that does not meet the working satellite criteria constitutes a constructive total loss of that satellite for insurance purposes 
the in orbit insurance policy is subject to certain exclusions including a deductible under which no claim is payable under the policy for the first satellite to suffer a constructive total loss or total loss 
we filed a claim under our in orbit insurance policy for all six satellites as either a total loss or constructive total loss 
the total loss claim was for the one satellite that suffered a power system failure resulting in loss of contact in february  and the constructive total loss claim for each of the other five satellites was on the basis that these satellites did not meet the working satellite criteria stated in the policy 
the maximum amount recoverable by us under the policy from third party insurers for all six satellites covered by the policy was million  after taking into account the one satellite deductible  under which no claim is payable for the first satellite to suffer a constructive total loss or total loss  and less any salvage value that can be established 
on december   we and the third party insurers entered into a settlement and release agreement to settle any and all claims relating to the cds and the five quick launch satellites discussed above 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we received million from the third party insurers 
in addition  each of the insurers has waived all rights  title and interest in and to the cds and the five quick launch satellites 
as a result  we recorded a million insurance recovery in our consolidated statements of operations in next generation satellite launch on may   we entered into an agreement with sierra nevada corporation snc to construct eighteen low earth orbit satellites in three sets of six satellites for our next generation satellites 
snc will also provide launch support services  a test satellite excluding the mechanical structure  a satellite software simulator and the associated ground support equipment 
further  we have the option  exercisable at any time until the third anniversary of the execution of the agreement  to order up to thirty additional satellites substantially identical to the eighteen satellites 
the total contract price is million  excluding any optional satellites or change order  subject to price reductions for failure to achieve certain milestones 
our agreement with snc does not include the falcon e as one of the launch vehicles covered under the fixed price contract 
we are negotiating with snc a change order to perform some or all of the additional work required to launch the next generation satellites on multiple falcon e launch vehicles but to date have not agreed with snc on any changes required 
we expect any such change order to result in increased costs 
if we are unable to agree on changes with snc  we intend to negotiate with our launch services provider  utilize internal resources or other third parties  to perform a portion of the required additional work 
snc is behind schedule on its contractual milestones although these delays are currently not impacting the first scheduled launch window in our contract with our launch services provider of december  through march  on august   we entered into commercial launch services agreement the lsa with space exploration technologies corp 
spacex pursuant to which spacex will provide launch services the launch services using multiple spacex falcon e launch vehicles for the carriage into low earth orbit our next generation commercial communications satellites currently being constructed by snc 
under the lsa  spacex will also provide us satellite to launch vehicle integration and support services  as well as certain related optional services 
the lsa anticipates that the launch services will be performed between the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  subject to certain rights of ours and spacex to reschedule any of the particular launch services as needed 
the lsa also provides us the option to procure  prior to each launch service  reflight launch services whereby in the event the applicable launch service results in a failure due to the spacex launch vehicle  spacex will provide comparable reflight launch services at no additional cost to us beyond the initial option price for such reflight launch services 

table of contents the total price payable under the lsa excluding any options or additional launch services is million  subject to certain adjustments 
we may postpone and reschedule the launch services for any reason at our sole discretion  following a delay of months for any particular launch services 
we also have the right to terminate any of the launch services subject to the payment of a termination fee in an amount that would be based on the date we exercise our termination right 
through a series of launches  we intend to replenish the existing constellation of satellites with next generation satellites with increased communications capabilities and our ais payload  which depending on the capabilities of the replacement satellites  which may require fewer satellites than we currently have 
flexibility in the number of satellites per launch  the number of satellites inserted into each plane and target plane may allow us to modify our plans within just a few months before launch 
in addition  we have required snc to include options to order additional satellites if the market demands such an increase or if lower latencies are required or to mitigate a launch failure 
first generation satellite health the majority of our current satellite fleet was put into service in the late s and has an estimated operating life of approximately nine to twelve years after giving effect to certain operational changes and software updates 
we believe that our satellite performance remains stable and sufficient for the use of our customers 
our satellite availability  or the percentage of time that an operational satellite is available to pass commercial traffic  was in twenty of the operational satellites have aggregate average availability over 
with the high probability of several satellites in view at any one time  especially in the primary coverage area  and the constant motion of the satellites  the time an operational satellite is unavailable is relatively insignificant 
we consider a satellite operational unless it can no longer provide any communications service  and we determine that further recovery efforts are not expected to return it to service 
due to our satellite constellation architecture  which consists of numerous independent satellites  our space segment is inherently redundant and service quality is not significantly affected by an individual satellite failure  although service quality could be significantly affected by multiple satellite failures 
our system has experienced minor degradation over time  equal to less than over the past five years excluding three satellites that have slightly lower commercial service capability 
the degradation is primarily due to battery capacity reduction 
we have and expect to continue to develop operational procedures to minimize the impact for providing messaging services with degraded batteries 
in  one of our plane d satellites  which had limited availability and a battery anomaly preventing nighttime operation  stopped providing regular operational service although it may continue to provide operational service on a limited basis 
the remaining five plane d satellites have been repositioned to minimize coverage gaps that impact system latency and overall capacity 
in addition  one of our plane b satellites is no longer providing operational service 
the remaining seven plane b satellites have been repositioned to minimize coverage gaps that impact system latency and overall capacity 
in april  our plane f polar satellite  one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in  was retired due to intermittent service  without any material impact on our service 
prior to such retirements  a failure of an operational satellite last occurred in october  prior to our acquisition of the satellite constellation in  when a satellite experienced a processor malfunction 
these failures are less than anticipated failure rates and demonstrate the benefits of a distributed satellite system architecture like ours 
we do not expect the absence of these satellites to materially affect our business 
these satellites are fully depreciated 
gateway health the gateway earth stations in the united states are performing well 
we continue to perform infrastructure upgrades including software upgrades which improved power conditioning and remote monitoring 
in general  our international gateway control centers are stable 
our gateway control centers all regularly exceeded availability on a month to month basis 
the majority of the international gateway earth stations are performing well 
in  the international gateway earth stations located in malaysia  south america and kazakhstan experienced intermittent outages 
we refurbished and replaced numerous components at the malaysian gateway earth station 
table of contents which has resolved the intermittent outages 
in  we expect to perform similar refurbishment activities at the kazakhstan and south american gateway earth stations 
network capacity we continue to conduct analyses to investigate the utilization of our communication channels 
various metrics were used in evaluating the different elements of the communication protocol 
the efficiency of the satellites random access subscriber receivers is measured as the ratio of successfully received inbound communication packets to the number of assignments made to subscriber communicators 
in the beginning of  the average value of this ratio was approximately  which is lower than the expected ratio of between and 
throughout and  a number of improvements were made to raise this performance ratio to over 
several modifications also were made in that impacted satellite capacity directly  resulting in a substantial increase in throughput capability 
it should be noted that failed messaging transactions do not result in lost messages  but do require subscriber communicators to re initiate message transmissions 
for the user  such instances could translate into message delays 
regulation of our system in the united states fcc authorization any entity seeking to construct  launch  or operate a commercial satellite system in the united states must first be licensed by the us federal communications commission fcc 
orbcomm license corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  holds the satellite constellation license originally issued to orbcomm global lp in which we refer to as the space segment license 
pursuant to an application we filed on may   the space segment license was most recently modified by the fcc on march   and currently authorizes the operation of the first generation orbcomm satellites  the construction  launch and operation a total of orbcomm next generation replacement satellites  as well any required construction  launch an operation during the term of the license of additional technically identical replacement satellites 
orbcomm license corp 
also holds additional fcc licenses to operate four united states gateway earth stations  and deploy and operate up to  subscriber communicators in the united states 
we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
we also believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  although we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
license renewal our space segment license renewal application was granted by the fcc on march   extending the term of the space segment license until april the current fcc licenses for the united states gateway earth stations and subscriber communicators expire on may  and june   respectively  and the renewal applications must be filed between and days prior to expiration 
although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license renewals  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact renew our fcc licenses in the future 
additionally  there can be no assurance that  to the extent that any modification our fcc licenses may be required in the future to address changed circumstances  that any related fcc applications we may file will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
fcc license conditions we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
we also believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  although we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
under the fcc s current rules and policies relating to little leo licensing  access in the united states to certain portions of the uplink and downlink spectrum assigned to our system was made subject to possible future spectrum sharing arrangements with one or more other little leo systems  if such systems are proposed  and then authorized by the fcc 
however  there are currently no other fcc little leo licensees authorized in our spectrum 
while other entities could seek to be licensed in the little leo service by the fcc  to our knowledge no new applications have been submitted to date 
if any one or more new entities are licensed and do in fact proceed with 
table of contents system deployment in accordance with the previously established fcc requirements  we believe that there would be no material adverse effect on our system operations  although we cannot assure you it will be the case 
non common carrier status all of our system s fcc licenses authorize service provision on a non common carrier basis 
as a result  the system and the services provided thereby have been subject to limited fcc regulations  but not the obligations  restrictions and reporting requirements applicable to common carriers or to providers of commercial mobile radio services  or cmrs 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future  we will not be deemed by the fcc to provide services that are designated common carrier or cmrs  or that the fcc will not exercise its discretionary authority to apply its common carrier or cmrs rules and regulations to us or our system 
if this were to occur  we would be subject to fcc obligations that include record retention requirements  limitations on use or disclosure of customer proprietary network information and truth in billing regulations 
in addition  we would need to obtain fcc approval for foreign ownership in excess of percent and authority under section of the communications act of  as amended  to provide international services 
finally  we would be subject to additional reporting obligations with regard to international traffic and circuits  and equal employment opportunity compliance 
united states import and export control regulations we are subject to us import and export control laws and regulations  specifically the arms export control act  the international traffic in arms regulations  the export administration regulations and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the us department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control  and we believe we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations 
we also believe that we have obtained all the specific authorizations currently needed to operate our business and believe that the terms of the relevant licenses are sufficient given the scope and duration of the activities to which they pertain 
regulation of our system in other countries communications services we  the relevant international licensee and or the relevant international licensee s country representative in each country outside the united states must obtain the requisite local regulatory authorization before the commencement of service in that country 
the process for obtaining the applicable regulatory authorization varies from country to country  and in some instances may require technical studies or actual experimental field tests under the direction and or supervision of the local regulatory authority 
failure to obtain or maintain any requisite authorizations in any given country or territory could mean that services may not be provided in that country or territory 
certain countries continue to require that some or all telecommunications services be provided by a government owned or controlled entity 
therefore  under such circumstances  we may be required to offer our services through a government owned or controlled entity 
as part of our international initiative  we are in the process of seeking or assessing the prospect of obtaining regulatory authority in other countries and territories  including china  india and russia 
because our satellites are licensed by the fcc  the scope of the local regulatory authority in any given country or territory outside of the united states with the exception of countries where gateway earth stations are located is generally limited to the operation of subscriber communicator equipment  but may also involve additional restrictions or conditions 
based on available information  we believe that the regulatory authorizations obtained by us  our international licensees and or their country representatives are sufficient for the provision of commercial services in the subject countries and territories  subject to continuing regulatory compliance 
we also believe that additional local service provision authorizations may be obtained in other countries and territories in the near future 
non us gateway earth stations to date  in addition to those in the united states  gateway earth stations have been authorized and deployed in argentina  australia  brazil  cura ao  italy  japan  kazakhstan  malaysia  morocco and south korea 
gateway 
table of contents earth stations are generally licensed on an individual facility basis 
this process normally entails radio frequency coordination within the country of operation for the specific frequencies to be used in the designated geographic location of the subject gateway earth station 
this domestic frequency coordination is in addition to any international coordination that may be required  as determined by the proximity of the gateway earth station location to foreign borders see international regulation of our system 
based on the best available information  we believe that each of the above listed gateway earth stations authorizations is sufficient for the provision of our commercial services in the areas served by the relevant facilities 
we will need additional gateway earth station authorizations in other countries as we install additional gateway earth stations around the world 
equipment standards each manufacturer of the applicable subscriber communicator is contractually responsible to obtain and maintain the governmental authorizations necessary to operate their subscriber communicators in each jurisdiction 
most countries generally require all radio transmission equipment used within their borders to comply with operating standards that may include specifications relating to required minimum acceptable levels for radiated power  power density and spurious emissions into adjacent frequency bands not allocated for the intended use 
technical criteria established by telecommunications equipment standards issued by the fcc and or the european telecommunications standards institute  or etsi  are generally accepted  and or closely duplicated by domestic equipment approval regulations in most countries 
all current models of subscriber communicators comply with established fcc standards and many comply with etsi standards 
international regulation of our system our use of certain orbital planes and related system radio frequency assignments  as licensed by the fcc  is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the itu 
in order to protect satellite systems from harmful radio frequency interference from other satellite communications systems  the itu maintains a master international frequency register  or mifr  of radio frequency assignments and their associated orbital locations 
each itu member state referred to as an administration is required by treaty to give notice of  coordinate and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations with the itu s radio communication bureau 
the fcc serves as the notifying administration for the united states and is responsible for filing and coordinating our allocated radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations for the system with both the itu s radio communication bureau and the national administrations of other countries in each satellite s service region 
while the fcc  as our notifying administration  is responsible for coordinating the system  in practice the satellite licensee is generally responsible for identifying any potential interference concerns with existing systems or those enjoying date priority and to coordinate with such systems 
if we are unable to reach agreement and finalize coordination  the fcc would then assist with such coordination 
when the coordination process is completed  the itu formally enters each satellite system s orbital and frequency use characteristics in the mifr 
such registration notifies all proposed users of frequencies that the registered satellite system is protected from interference from subsequent or non conforming uses by other nations 
in the event disputes arise during coordination  the itu s radio regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution procedures are based on the willingness of the parties concerned to reach a mutually acceptable agreement voluntarily 
neither the itu specifically  nor international law generally  provides clear remedies if this voluntary process fails 
the fcc has notified the itu that our system was initially placed in service in april and that it has operated without any substantiated complaints of interference since that time 
the fcc has also informed the itu that our system has successfully completed its coordination with all countries other than russia 
we expect that we will successfully complete the itu coordination process with russia in the future  at which time the complete system will be formally registered in the mifr 
on september   the fcc transmitted an advance publication submission to the itu relating to the cds  the quick launch satellites and the next generation satellites  the first step in the international coordination process for our new satellites 
if design modifications to future system satellites entail substantial changes to the frequency utilization by the subject system component s  additional 
table of contents international coordination may be required or reasonably deemed advisable 
however  we believe that itu coordination can be successfully completed in all circumstances where such coordination is required  although we cannot assure you that we will successfully complete such itu coordination 
failure to complete requisite itu coordination could have a material adverse effect on our business 
regardless  to date  and to our best knowledge  the system has not caused harmful interference to any other radio system  or suffered harmful interference from any other radio system

item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
any of these risks could also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or the price of our common stock 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 

table of contents risks relating to our business a global recession and continued worldwide credit and capital constraints could adversely affect us 
recent global economic conditions  including concerns about a continued global recession  tightening of credit and capital markets and failures or material business deteriorations of financial institutions and other entities  have resulted in unprecedented government intervention in the us  europe and other regions of the world 
in addition  the market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and a reduction of general business activity 
if these conditions continue or worsen  risks to us include potential declines in revenues  profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders for our products and services  payment delays or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers  end users and prospective customers and end users  potential adverse impacts on our ability and our customers and vendors ability to access credit and capital sources  and potential reprioritization by our customers  end users and prospective customers and end users of resources away from investments in capital improvements  equipment  vehicles or vessels which use our products and services including in the transportation market among other markets which use our products and services 
any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flow 
our business plan depends on both increased demand for mobile satellite services and our ability to successfully implement it 
our business plan is predicated on growth in demand for mm and ais mobile data satellite services 
demand for such satellite services may not grow  or may even contract  either generally or in particular geographic markets  for particular types of services or during particular time periods 
a lack of demand could impair our ability to sell products and services  develop and successfully market new products and services and could exert downward pressure on prices 
any decline in prices would decrease our revenues and profitability and negatively affect our ability to generate cash for investments and other working capital needs 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain the health  capacity and control of our existing satellite network  the ability of our vendors to successfully complete the design  build and launch of our next generation satellites and related ground infrastructure  products and services and  once launched  our ability to maintain the health  capacity and control of such satellite constellation  the level of market acceptance and demand for our products and services  our ability to introduce innovative new products and services that satisfy market demand  our ability to sell our products and services in additional countries  the ability of our oems  vars and ivars to market and distribute their products  services and applications effectively and their continued development of innovative and improved solutions and applications for our products and services  the effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering similar services and products  and our ability to maintain competitive prices for our products and services and control costs 

table of contents we have incurred substantial operating losses and are incurring net losses 
we anticipate additional future losses 
we must increase our revenues to become profitable 
we have had annual net losses since our inception  including a net loss of million for fiscal year and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our future results will continue to reflect significant operating expenses  including expenses associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts  maintaining the infrastructure to operate as a public company and the maintenance of existing gateway earth stations and satellite network ground segment facilities 
as a result  we may incur additional operating losses and net losses in the future 
the continued development of our business also will require additional capital expenditures for  among other things  the development  construction  launch and insurance for our next generation satellites  and the installation of additional gateway earth stations and associated satellite network ground segment facilities around the world  as well as the maintenance of existing gateway earth stations and satellite network ground segment facilities that we own and operate 
accordingly  as we make these capital investments  our future results will include greater depreciation and amortization expense which reflect the full cost of acquiring these new assets 
in order to become profitable  we must increase revenue 
revenue will depend on the success of our resellers and acceptance of our products and services by end users in current markets  as well as in new geographic and industry markets 
we may not become profitable and we may not be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
we may need additional capital to complete our capital expenditure plans  which may not be available to us when we need it on favorable terms  or at all 
our next generation satellites may not be completed on time  and the costs associated with it may be greater than expected 
if our future cash flows from operations are less than expected or if our capital expenditures exceed our spending plans  either in terms of aggregate amount or timing  our existing sources of liquidity  including cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from sales of our products and services may not be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations  capital expenditures including the deployment of additional satellites  working capital and other financing requirements 
if we continue to incur operating losses in the future  we may need to reduce further our operating costs or obtain alternate sources of financing  or both  to remain viable and  in particular  to fund the design  construction  launch and insurance for our next generation satellites 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to additional sources of capital on favorable terms or at all 
we estimate that the aggregate costs associated with the design  building launch and insurance of our next generation satellites and related infrastructure upgrades will be approximately million  approximately million of which has been paid 
we may not complete our next generation satellites and related infrastructure  products and services on time  on budget or at all 
the design  manufacture and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been subject to delays and cost overruns 
the deployment of our next generation satellites may suffer from delays  interruptions or increased costs due to many factors  some of which may be beyond our control  including lower than anticipated internally generated cash flows  engineering or manufacturing performance falling below expected levels of output or efficiency  denial or delays in receipt of regulatory approvals or non compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities  the breakdown or failure of equipment or systems  non performance by third party contractors  including the prime system contractor and associated subcontractors  the inability to license necessary technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all  use of a new or unproven launch vehicle  launch delays or failures or in orbit satellite failures once launched or the decision to manufacture additional replacement satellites for future launches  
table of contents labor disputes or disruptions in labor productivity or the unavailability of skilled labor  changes in project scope  additional requirements imposed by changes in laws  and severe weather or catastrophic events such as fires  earthquakes  storms or explosions 
if any of the above events occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to deploy our next generation satellites and related infrastructure  products and services 
we incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance requirements 
we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses as a public company  including costs resulting from regulations regarding corporate governance practices 
for example  the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors  audit committees  distribution of annual and interim reports  stockholder meetings  stockholder approvals  solicitation of proxies  conflicts of interest  stockholder voting rights and codes of conduct 
our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements 
moreover  these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly 
further  these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
if end users do not accept our services and the applications developed by vars or we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or licenses for particular countries or territories  we will fail to attract new customers and our business will be harmed 
our success depends on end users accepting our services  the applications developed by vars  and a number of other factors  including the technical capabilities of our system  the availability of low cost subscriber communicators  the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and other approvals in the united states and other countries and territories in which we operate  the price of our services and the extent and availability of competitive or alternative services 
we may not succeed in increasing revenue from the sale of our products and services to new and existing customers 
our failure to significantly increase the number of end users will harm our business 
our business plan assumes that potential customers and end users will accept certain limitations inherent in our system 
for example  our satellite system is optimized for small packet  or narrowband  data transmissions  is subject to certain delays in the relay of messages  referred to as latencies  and may be subject to certain line of sight limitations between our satellites and the end user s subscriber communicator 
in addition  our satellite system is not capable of handling voice traffic 
certain potential end users  particularly those requiring full time  real time communications and those requiring the transmission of large amounts of data or voice traffic  may find such limitations unacceptable 
furthermore  our satellite based ais system does not receive all ais transmission signals on ais equipped vessels in a given day due to signal collisions and co channel interference of ais transmissions  particularly in areas with a high density of ais equipped vessels such as ports 
in addition to the limitations imposed by the architecture of our system  our failure to obtain the necessary regulatory and other approvals or licenses in a given country or territory will preclude the availability of our services in such country or territory until such time  if at all  that such approvals or licenses can be obtained 
certain potential end users requiring messaging services in those countries and territories may find such limitations unacceptable 
we face competition from existing and potential competitors in the telecommunications industry  including numerous terrestrial and satellite based network systems with greater resources  which could reduce our market share and revenues 
competition in the telecommunications industry is intense  fueled by rapid  continuous technological advances and alliances between industry participants seeking to capture significant market share 
we face competition from numerous existing and potential alternative telecommunications products and services provided 
table of contents by various large and small companies  including sophisticated two way satellite based data and voice communication services and next generation digital cellular services  such as gsm and g  which has influenced the price at which our vars and other service providers offer our services 
the provision of satellite based data services and products is subject to downward price pressure to expand their respective market share 
recently  competition from iridium  inmarsat and  to a lesser extent  globalstar  three global satellite communication services operators  has been increasing with respect to low speed data service 
in addition  a continuing trend toward consolidation and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry could give rise to significant new competitors  and foreign competitors may benefit from government subsidies  or other protective measures  afforded by its home country 
some of these competitors may provide more efficient or less expensive services than we are able to provide  which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our revenues and business 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
additionally  many of these companies have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers 
furthermore  these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer customers more attractive terms than we can 
we have a limited operating history and recently commenced the commercialization of our new satellite based ais service  which makes it difficult to evaluate your investment in us 
we have conducted commercial operations since april  when we acquired substantially all of our current communications system from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries 
in addition  we recently commenced the commercialization of our new satellite based ais service and four of our six satellites recently launched with ais capability have failed and are no longer able to provide service 
our prospects and ability to implement our current business plan  including our ability to provide commercial two way data communications service in key markets on a global basis and to generate revenues and positive operating cash flows  will depend on our ability to  among other things successfully operate and maintain our remaining two quick launch satellites with ais capability in light of the failure of the other quick launch satellites of identical design  and successfully design  construct  launch  place in commercial service  operate and maintain our next generation satellites in a timely and cost efficient manner  develop licensing and distribution arrangements in key markets within and outside the united states sufficient to capture and retain an adequate customer base  install the necessary ground infrastructure and obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory and other approvals in key markets outside the united states  by our own efforts or through our existing or future international licensees  to expand our business internationally  and successfully attract and maintain manufacturers that provide for the timely design  manufacture and distribution of subscriber communicators in sufficient quantities  with appropriate functional characteristics and at competitive prices  for various applications 
given our limited operating history  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives or develop a sufficiently large revenue generating customer base to achieve profitability 
in particular  because we acquired a fully operational satellite constellation and communications system from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries  our current senior management team has limited experience with managing the design  construction  launch  and in orbit testing and deployment of a satellite system 
the cds and three quick launch satellites experienced anomalies that subsequently resulted in a loss of contact with these satellites  which could also occur with the two remaining quick launch satellites of the same design 
any additional losses of these satellites could have a major impact on our plans to replenish and extend the operating life of our satellite constellation 
even if we can determine the root cause and establish operations procedures  if any  to preclude similar failures from occurring on the remaining two quick launch satellites that are of the same design  we may not be able to prevent a similar occurrence from happening on the remaining two quick launch satellites 

table of contents our plans to extend the operating life of our network are dependent on the health of our satellites  and the failure of the cds and other quick launch satellites could have a significant impact on the operating life of our network 
the continued operation of the remaining two deployed quick launch satellites is important to us to leverage our work with ais to then resell ais data collected by our satellites  as well as to augment our current satellite constellation 
in addition  these new satellites were intended to supplement and ultimately replace our existing plane a satellites and are important to maintain adequate service levels and to provide additional capacity for future subscriber growth 
a failure of our remaining deployed quick launch satellites could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are relying on these satellites to provide ais data service 
if these satellites also fail  we will not be able to provide ais data service  including under existing contracts  unless we are able to procure other ais data from third parties or until the launch of our ais payload equipped next generation satellites 
see the orbcomm communications system system status for a description of the status of our communications network 
our success in generating sufficient cash from operations to fund a portion of the cost of constructing  launching and insuring our next generation satellites will depend in part on the market acceptance and success of our new ais data service  which may not occur 
we recently commenced the commercialization of our satellite based ais service to receive and report ais transmissions to be used for ship tracking and other navigational activities  and have been working closely with the us coast guard on the ais project 
four of our six satellites launched with ais capability have failed and are no longer able to provide service 
we intend to market ais data received from the remaining two quick launch satellites as well as our next generation satellites to other us and international government agencies  as well as to companies whose businesses require such information 
we are currently relying on the two remaining quick launch satellites to provide ais data service 
if these satellites also fail  we will not be able to provide ais data service  including under existing contracts  unless we are able to procure other ais data from third parties or until the launch of our ais payload equipped next generation satellites 
the market for our satellite based ais service is new and untested 
we cannot predict with certainty the potential demand for the services we plan to offer or the extent to which we will be able to meet that demand 
although we believe the market for satellite based ais service is significant  the actual size of the market is unknown and subject to significant uncertainty 
demand for our ais data service offerings in general  in particular geographic markets  for particular types of services or during particular time periods may not enable us to generate sufficient positive cash flow to fund a portion of the cost of our next generation satellites 
among other things  end user acceptance of our ais data service offerings will depend upon our ability to maintain commercially acceptable ais service from the remaining two quick launch satellites in light of the failure of the other quick launch satellites of identical design 
the actual size of the addressable market  our ability to provide attractive service offerings at competitive prices to our target markets  the effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering alternative technologies or lower priced services  and general and local economic conditions 
our business plan assumes a rapidly growing revenue base for ais data service 
if we cannot implement this business plan successfully and gain market acceptance for these planned ais data services  our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on third parties to market and distribute our services to end users 
if these parties are unwilling or unable to provide applications and services to end users  our business will be harmed 
we rely on vars to market and distribute our services to end users in the united states  and we rely on international licensees  country representatives  vars and ivars  outside the united states we refer collectively here to all such parties as resellers 
we also rely on resellers to market and distribute our ais services 
the 
table of contents willingness of our existing resellers  as well as potential new resellers  to engage or continue to engage in our business depends on a number of factors  including whether they perceive our services to be compatible with their business objectives  whether they believe we will successfully deploy our next generation satellites  whether the prices they can charge end users will provide an adequate return  and regulatory constraints  if any 
we believe that successful marketing of our services will depend on the design  development and commercial availability of applications that support the specific needs of the targeted end users 
the design  development and implementation of applications require the commitment of substantial financial and technological resources on the part of these resellers 
certain resellers are  and many potential resellers will be  newly formed or small ventures with limited financial resources  and such entities might not be successful in their efforts to design applications or effectively market our services 
the inability of these resellers to provide applications to end users could have a harmful effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our success depends upon the pricing of applications by our resellers to end users  over which we have no control other than with respect to ais services under certain circumstances 
as a result of these arrangements  we are dependent on the performance of our resellers to generate substantially all our service revenues 
if our resellers fail to market or distribute our services effectively  our revenues  profitability  liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected 
defects or errors in applications could result in end users not being able to use our services  which would damage our reputation and harm our financial condition 
our resellers must develop applications quickly to keep pace with rapidly changing markets 
these applications  as well as new models of subscriber communicators  have long development cycles and are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when subsequent versions are introduced  which could result in the disruption of our services to the end users 
while we sometimes assist our resellers in developing applications  we have limited ability to accelerate development cycles to avoid errors and defects in their applications 
such disruption could damage our reputation as well as the reputation of the respective resellers  and result in lost customers  lost revenue  diverted development resources  and increased service and warranty costs 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss or decline or slowdown in growth in business of any customer could seriously harm our business 
significant customers such as the ai subsidiary of id systems  inc formerly a division of ge  represented and of our revenues in and  respectively  caterpillar  and hitachi represent a substantial portion of our revenues in and  and are expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future 
we expect ai to continue to represent a substantial part of our revenues in the near future 
as a result  the loss of these customers or any other major customer  or decline or slowdown in the growth in business of these customers or any other significant customer  which could occur at any time  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage of the orbcomm system by our customers and end users  the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of ai or any other significant customer  which could occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of billable subscriber communicators activated on the orbcomm system by such customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our international licensees and country representatives are not successful in establishing their businesses outside of the united states  the prospects for our business will be limited 
outside of the united states  we rely in part on international licensees and country representatives to establish businesses in their respective territories  including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals as well as managing local vars 
international licensees and country representatives may not be successful in obtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory and other approvals to provide our services in their assigned territories and  even if those approvals are obtained and maintained  international licensees and or country representatives may not be successful in developing a market and or distribution network within their territories 
certain of the international licensees and or country representatives are  or are likely to be  newly formed 
table of contents or small ventures with limited or no operational history and limited financial resources  and any such entities may not be successful in their efforts to secure adequate financing and to continue operating 
in addition  in certain countries and territories outside the united states  we rely on international licensees and country representatives to operate and maintain various components of our system  such as gateway earth stations 
these international licensees and country representatives may not be successful in operating and maintaining such components of our communications system and may not have the same financial incentives as we do to maintain those components in good repair 
some of our international licensees and country representatives are experiencing significant operational and financial difficulties and have in the past defaulted on their obligations to us 
many of our international licensees and country representatives were also international licensees and country representatives of our predecessor company and  as a consequence of the bankruptcy of orbcomm global lp  they were left in many cases with significant financial problems  including significant debt and insufficient working capital 
certain of our international licensees and country representatives including in korea  malaysia  mexico  south america and africa  and to a lesser extent  europe have not yet been able to successfully or adequately reorganize or recapitalize themselves and as a result have continued to experience significant material difficulties  including the failure to pay us for our services 
to date  several of our licensees and country representatives have had difficulty in paying their usage fees and have not paid us or have paid us at reduced rates and in cases where collectibility is not reasonably assured  we have not reflected invoices issued to such licensees and country representatives in our revenues or accounts receivable 
the ability of these international licensees and country representatives to pay their obligations to us may be dependent  in many cases  upon their ability to successfully restructure their business and operations or raise additional capital 
in addition  we have from time to time had disagreements with certain of our international licensees related to these operational and financial difficulties 
to the extent these international licensees and country representatives are unable to reorganize and or raise additional capital to execute their business plans on favorable terms or are delayed in doing so  our ability to offer services internationally and recognize revenue will be impaired and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
as a result of these difficulties experienced by our international licensees  we have and expect to continue to acquire their operations and  where permissible  seek to maintain control of international licensees through majority ownership 
although we have implemented a strategy for the acquisition of certain independent licensees and gateway earth station operators when circumstances permit  we may not be able to continue to implement this strategy on favorable terms and may not be able to realize the additional efficiencies that we anticipate from this strategy 
in some regions it is impracticable to acquire the independent gateway earth station operators either because local regulatory requirements or business or cultural norms do not permit an acquisition  because the expected revenue increase from an acquisition would be insufficient to justify the transaction  or because the independent gateway earth station operator will not sell at a price acceptable to us 
in those regions  our revenue and profits may be adversely affected if those independent gateway earth station operators do not fulfill their own business plans to increase substantially their sales of services and products 
while expanding our international operations would advance our growth  it would also increase numerous risks  including difficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors  difficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the needs of local customers  lack of local acceptance or knowledge of our products and services  lack of recognition of our products and services  unavailability of or difficulties in establishing relationships with distributors  significant investments  including the development and deployment of dedicated gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure as certain countries require physical gateways within their jurisdiction to connect the traffic coming to and from their territory  
table of contents instability of international economies and governments  changes in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions  exposure to varying legal standards  including intellectual property protection and foreign state ownership laws  in other jurisdictions  difficulties in obtaining required regulatory authorizations  difficulties in enforcing legal rights in other jurisdictions  local domestic ownership requirements  changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements  and foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls 
these risks could affect our ability to successfully compete and expand internationally 
the prices for most of our products and services are denominated in us dollars 
any appreciation of the us dollar against other currencies will increase the cost of our products and services to our international customers and  as a result  may reduce the competitiveness of our international offerings and make it more difficult for us to grow internationally 
we currently are unable to offer near real time service in important regions of the world due to the absence of gateway earth stations in those areas  which is limiting our growth and our ability to compete 
our objective is to establish a worldwide service network  either directly or through independent gateway operators  but to date we have been unable to do so in certain areas of the world and we may not succeed in doing so in the future 
we have been unable to find capable independent gateway operators or otherwise obtain regulatory authorizations to install and operate gateway earth stations for several important regions and countries  including southern africa  india  russia and certain parts of southeast asia 
this could reduce overall demand for our products and services and reduce the value of our services for potential users who require service in these areas 
a natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide communications service 
natural disasters could damage or destroy our gateway earth stations or our other ground based facilities resulting in a disruption of service to our customers in the affected region 
in addition  the collateral effects of such natural disasters could impair the functioning of our ground equipment 
if a natural disaster were to impair or destroy any of our ground facilities  we might be unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time 
even if the gateway earth stations are not affected by natural disasters  our service could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages wireline or terrestrial wireless networks that we utilize  or disrupts our ability to connect to those networks 
such failure or service disruptions could harm our business and results of operations 
we rely on a limited number of manufacturers for our subscriber communicators 
if we are unable to  or cannot find third parties to  manufacture a sufficient quantity of subscriber communicators at a reasonable price  the prospects for our business will be negatively impacted 
the development and availability on a timely basis of relatively inexpensive subscriber communicators are critical to the successful commercial operation of our system 
our stellar subsidiary relies on a contract manufacturer  delphi automotive systems llc  or delphi  a subsidiary of delphi corporation  to produce subscriber communicators 
our customers may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of subscriber communicators at price points or with functional characteristics and reliability that meet their needs 
an inability to successfully develop and manufacture subscriber communicators that meet the needs of customers and are available in sufficient numbers and at prices that render our services cost effective to customers could limit the acceptance of our system and potentially affect the quality of our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business may be materially and adversely affected if stellar s agreement with delphi corporation is terminated or modified 
if our agreements with third party manufacturers are  or stellar s agreement with delphi corporation is  terminated or expire  our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant 
table of contents delays  added expense and an inability to maintain or expand our customer base 
any of these events could require us to take unforeseen actions or devote additional resources to provide our services and could harm our ability to compete effectively 
there are currently three manufacturers of subscriber communicators  including stellar  quake global  inc  or quake  and digi international  which acquired mobile applitech s business 
in addition  sierra wireless is manufacturing a model of dual mode subscriber communicator gsm cellular and orbcomm based on a licensing arrangement with digi international with respect to the orbcomm communications component 
if our agreements with third party manufacturers  including our subscriber communicator manufacturing agreements with quake or digi international are terminated or expire  our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant delays in customers activating subscriber communicators on our communications system  added expense for our customers and our inability to maintain or expand our customer base 
we depend on recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so would seriously harm our business 
because of the technical nature of our services and the market in which we compete  our success depends on the continued services of our key personnel  including certain of our engineering personnel  and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our executive officers or key technical personnel 
competitors and others have in the past  and may in the future  attempt to recruit our employees 
the available pool of individuals with relevant experience in the satellite industry is limited  and the process of identifying and recruiting personnel with the skills necessary to operate our system can be lengthy and expensive 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training  which requires significant resources and management attention 
even if we invest significant resources to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts 
our management team is subject to a variety of demands for its attention and rapid growth which could further strain our management and other resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently face a variety of challenges  including maintaining the infrastructure and systems necessary for us to operate as a public company  addressing our potential litigation matters and managing the growth of our business 
our recent growth and expansion has increased the responsibilities of our management team 
any litigation  regardless of the merit or resolution  could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management 
as we continue to expand  we may further strain our management and other resources 
our failure to meet these challenges as a result of insufficient management or other resources could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
pursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional risks 
we may pursue acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic transactions on an opportunistic basis 
we may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions  including integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture 
these risks may include legal  organizational  financial  loss of key customers and distributors and diversion of management s time 
in addition  if we were to choose to engage in any major business combination or similar strategic transaction  we may require significant external financing in connection with the transaction 
depending on market conditions  investor perceptions of our company and other factors  we may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms  in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement any such transaction 
any such financing  if obtained  may further dilute existing stockholders 

table of contents we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder  consumer  antitrust and other issues 
as described in item legal proceedings  we have been involved in a number of litigation matters including a class action lawsuit that was settled by our insurance provider in litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  including increases in demands for attention on our management team  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change and we may not be able to compete with new and emerging technologies 
we operate in the telecommunications industry  which is characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological change 
new and advanced technology which can perform essentially the same functions as our messaging and ais service though without global coverage  such as digital cellular networks gsm and g  direct broadcast satellites  new deployed satellites of competing low earth orbit satellite systems and other forms of wireless transmission  are in various stages of development by others in the industry 
these technologies are being developed  supported and rolled out by entities that may have significantly greater resources than we do 
these technologies could adversely impact the demand for our services 
research and development by others may lead to technologies that render some or all of our services non competitive or obsolete in the future 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we may be subjected to increased regulatory restrictions which could disrupt our service or increase our operating costs 
system operators and service providers are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of various countries and the rules and policies they adopt 
these rules and policies  among other things  establish technical parameters for the operation of facilities and subscriber communicators  determine the permissible uses of facilities and subscriber communicators  and establish the terms and conditions pursuant to which our international licensees and country representatives operate their facilities  including certain of the gateway earth stations and gateway control centers in our system 
these rules and policies may also require our international licensees and country representatives to cut off the data passing through the gateway earth stations or gateway control centers without notifying us or our end users  significantly disrupting the operation of our communications system 
these rules and policies may also impose regulatory constraints on the use of subscriber communicators within certain countries or territories 
international and domestic licensing and certification requirements may cause a delay in the marketing of our services and products  may impose costly fees and procedures on our international licensees and country representatives  and may give a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete with our international licensees and country representatives 
possible future changes to regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate may result in additional regulatory requirements or restrictions on the services and equipment we provide  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
although we believe that we or our international licensees and country representatives have obtained all the licenses required to conduct our business as it is operated today  we may not be able to obtain  modify or maintain such licenses in the future 
moreover  changes in international or domestic licensing and certification requirements may result in disruptions of our communications services or alternatively result in added operational costs  which could harm our business 
our use of certain orbital planes and radio frequency assignments  as licensed by the fcc  is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the itu 
in the event disputes arise during coordination  the itu s radio regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms and neither the itu specifically  nor does international law generally  provide clear remedies in this situation 
finally  our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  fees  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  fees  policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory environment  including with respect to prohibiting or limiting the distribution of real or near real time ais data 

table of contents our business relies on our ability to maintain our fcc licenses 
our fcc licenses a license for the satellite constellation  separate licenses for the four us gateway earth stations and a blanket license for the subscriber communicators are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy certain conditions or to meet certain prescribed milestones 
our fcc satellite constellation license is valid until april and authorizes the continued operation of the first generation orbcomm satellites  the construction  launch and operation of a total of orbcomm next generation satellites  as well any required construction  launch an operation during the term of the license of additional technically identical replacement satellites 
the us gateway earth station and subscriber communicator licenses will expire in renewal applications for the gateway earth station and subscriber communicator licenses must be filed between and days prior to expiration 
although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license renewals  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact renew our fcc licenses in the future 
additionally  there can be no assurance that  to the extent that any modification of our fcc licenses may be required in the future to address changed circumstances  that any related fcc applications we may file will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fcc revokes or fails to renew our fcc licenses  or does not grant any future application we file to modify one or more of our licenses  or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our fcc licenses  any such circumstance could have a material adverse impact on our business 
finally  our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory environment 
our business would be harmed if our international licensees and country representatives fail to acquire and retain all necessary regulatory approvals  we are currently unable to offer service in important regions of the world due to regulatory requirements  which is limiting our growth and our ability to compete 
our business is affected by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which we operate 
due to foreign ownership restrictions in various jurisdictions around the world  obtaining and maintaining local regulatory approval for operation of our system is the responsibility of our international licensees and or country representatives in each of these licensed territories 
in addition  in certain countries regulatory frameworks may be rudimentary or in an early stage of development  which can make it difficult or impossible to license and operate our system in such jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that our international licensees  our country representatives and or us will be successful in obtaining or maintaining any additional approvals that may be desirable and  if these efforts are not successful  we will be unable to provide service in such countries 
our inability to offer service in one or more important new markets  particularly in china or india  could have a negative impact on our ability to generate more revenue and could diminish our business prospects 
our ability to provide service in certain regions is limited by local regulations as some countries  like china  india and russia  have specific regulatory requirements such as local domestic ownership requirements or requirements for physical gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure within their jurisdiction to connect traffic coming to and from their territory 
while we are currently in discussions with parties in these countries to satisfy these regulatory requirements  we may not be able find an acceptable local partner or reach an agreement to develop additional gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure or the cost of developing and deploying such infrastructure may be prohibitive  which could impair our ability to expand our product and service offerings in such areas and undermine our value for potential users who require service in these areas 
the inability to offer to sell our products and services in all major international markets could impair our international growth 
in addition  the construction of such gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure in foreign countries may require us to comply with certain us regulatory requirements which may contravene the laws or regulations of the local jurisdiction 
there are numerous risks inherent to our international operations that are beyond our control 
international telecommunications services are subject to country and region risks 
most of our coverage area and some of our subsidiaries are outside the united states 
as a result  we are subject to certain risks on a country by country or region by region basis  including changes in domestic and foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  licensing requirements  tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers  exchange 
table of contents controls  expropriation  and political and economic instability  including fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies which may make payment in us dollars more expensive for foreign customers or payment in foreign currencies less valuable for us 
certain of these risks may be greater in developing countries or regions  where economic  political or diplomatic conditions may be significantly more volatile than those commonly experienced in the united states and other industrialized countries 
we do not currently maintain in orbit or other insurance for our satellites 
we do not currently maintain in orbit insurance coverage for our satellites to address the risk of potential systemic anomalies  failures or catastrophic events affecting the existing satellite constellation 
we obtained in orbit insurance for the cds and five quick launch satellites for total loss or constructive total loss as defined under the terms of the policy 
on december   we and the third party insurers entered into a settlement and release agreement to settle all claims related to the cds and the five quick launch satellites for million 
we may obtain launch insurance for the launch of our next generation satellites 
however  any determination as to whether we procure insurance  including in orbit and launch insurance  will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of insurance in the market and the cost of available insurance 
we may not be able to obtain insurance at reasonable costs 
even if we obtain insurance  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses we may suffer due to applicable deductions and exclusions 
the price  terms and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite services 
the cost of obtaining insurance can vary as a result of either satellite failures or general conditions in the insurance industry 
insurance policies on satellites may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition to higher premiums  insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles  shorter coverage periods and additional satellite health related policy exclusions 
an uninsured failure of one or more of our satellites could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  higher premiums on insurance policies would increase our costs  thereby reducing our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums 
moreover  if we were to determine in the future that the terms of any particular insurance is economically unfavorable or unfeasible after taking into account factors such as cost of the insurance and scope of insurance exclusions and limitations  we may elect to self insure against losses of such satellites 
even where we have obtained in orbit insurance for a satellite  this insurance coverage will not protect us against all losses that might arise as a result of a satellite failure 
our current in orbit insurance policies contain  and any future policies can be expected to contain  specified exclusions and material change limitations customary in the industry at the time the policy is written 
these exclusions typically relate to losses resulting from acts of war  insurrection or military action  government confiscation  as well as lasers  directed energy beams  or nuclear or anti satellite devices or radioactive contamination 
in addition  should we wish to launch a spare satellite to replace a failed operational satellite  the timing of such launch will be dependent on prior commitments made by potential suppliers of launch services to other satellite operators 
our insurance does not protect us against lost or delayed revenue  business interruption or lost business opportunities 
we do not maintain third party liability insurance with respect to our satellites 
accordingly  we have no insurance to cover any third party damages that may be caused by any of our satellites 
if we experience significant uninsured losses  such events could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business relies on intellectual property  some of which third parties own  and we may inadvertently infringe upon their patents and proprietary rights 
many entities  including some of our competitors  currently or may in the future hold patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that we offer 
we cannot assure you that we are aware of all intellectual property rights that our products may infringe upon 
in general  if a court were to determine that one or more of our products infringes upon intellectual property held by others  we may be required to cease developing or marketing those products  to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property  or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing upon others patents 
we cannot estimate 
table of contents the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain intellectual property licenses  or the availability and cost of any such licenses 
to the extent that we are required to pay royalties to third parties to whom we are not currently making payments  these increased costs of doing business could negatively affect our profitability or liquidity 
if a competitor holds intellectual property rights  it may not allow us to use its intellectual property at any price  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
if we become subject to unanticipated domestic or foreign tax or fee liabilities  it could materially increase our costs 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions 
we believe that we have complied in all material respects with our obligations to pay taxes in these jurisdictions 
however  our position is subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions 
if the applicable taxing authorities were to challenge successfully our current tax positions  or if there were changes in the manner in which we conduct our activities  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  we could become subject to material unanticipated tax or fee liabilities 
we may also become subject to additional tax or fee liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws  which could in certain circumstances have a retroactive effect 
risks related to our technology new satellites are subject to launch failures  delays and cost overruns  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations and business 
satellites are subject to certain risks related to failed or delayed launches 
launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites  and to obtain other launch opportunities 
launch delays can be caused by a number of factors  including delays in manufacturing satellites  preparing satellites for launch  securing appropriate launch vehicles or obtaining regulatory approvals 
we intend to conduct various satellite launches for our next generation satellites that could commence as early as the fourth quarter of to replenish existing satellites and to augment the existing constellation in order to expand the messaging capacity of our network and improve the service level of our network 
any launch failures of our additional satellites could result in delays of at least six to nine months from the date of the launch failure until additional satellites under construction are completed and their launches are achieved 
such delays would have a negative impact on our future growth and would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our satellites have a limited operating life  a number of our recently launched satellites have failed and others have degraded over time resulting in increased system latencies 
if we are unable to deploy replacement satellites  our services will be harmed and materially and adversely affect our operations and business 
the majority of our first generation satellites were placed into orbit between and our first generation satellites have an average operating life of approximately nine to twelve years after giving effect to certain operational changes and software updates 
on june   we launched five of the six quick launch satellites together with our cds in a single mission to supplement and ultimately replace our existing plane a satellites and we plan launch our next generation satellites that could commence as early as the fourth quarter of in addition to supplementing and replacing our first generation satellites  these satellites were also intended to expand the capacity of our communications system 
four of our six recently deployed satellites have failed and are no longer able to provide service 
the failure of our two remaining deployed quick launch satellites  which are of the same design of the failed quick launch satellites  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are relying on these satellites to provide ais data service 
if these satellites also fail  we will not be able to provide ais data service  including under existing contracts  unless we are able to procure other ais data from third parties or until the launch of our ais payload equipped next generation satellites 
these satellite failures combined with the aging of our first generation satellites have resulted in increased system 
table of contents latencies  which have resulted and may continue to result in our customers or potential customers delaying deployments or using a competing wireless data network 
while we expect that our current constellation to provide a commercially acceptable level of satellite messaging service through the scheduled launch of our next generation satellites  we cannot guarantee we will be able to provide such level of service through such launches of our next generation satellites 
also  our satellites have already exceeded their original design lives and the actual remaining useful lives of our satellites may be shorter than we expect 
if we are unable to effectively develop and deploy our next generation satellites before our current constellation ceases to provide a commercially acceptable level of service our business will suffer 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the payload  bus and launch vehicle for our next generation satellites and any increased cost  delay or disruption in the supply of these components and related services will adversely affect our ability to replenish our satellite constellation and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we entered into an agreement with sierra nevada corporation snc to design and manufacture next generation satellites 
in  we entered into a commercial launch services agreement with space exploration technologies corp 
spacex to provide launch services using multiple spacex falcon e launch vehicles for the carriage into low earth orbit of our next generation satellites being constructed by snc 
our reliance on these suppliers for their services involves significant risks and uncertainties  including whether our suppliers will provide an adequate supply of required components of sufficient quality  will charge the agreed upon prices for the components or will perform their obligations on a timely basis 
if any of our suppliers becomes financially unstable  we may have to find a new supplier 
there are a limited number of suppliers for communication satellite components and related services and the lead time required to qualify a new supplier may take several months 
there are only a limited number of suppliers to launch our satellites 
there is no assurance that a new supplier will be found on a timely basis  or at all  if any one of our suppliers ceases to supply their services for our satellites or cease to provide launch services 
any delay in our launch schedule could adversely affect our ability to provide communications services  particularly as the health of our current satellite constellation declines and we could lose current or prospective customers as a result of service interruptions 
the loss of any of our satellite suppliers or delay in our launch schedule or any significant increase in costs in our next generation satellite program could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
once launched and properly deployed  our satellites are subject to significant operating risks due to various types of potential anomalies 
satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and  accordingly  are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions  or anomalies  that may occur in our satellites 
some of the principal satellite anomalies include mechanical failures due to manufacturing error or defect  including mechanical failures that degrade the functionality of a satellite  such as the failure of solar array panel deployment mechanisms  antenna failures that degrade the communications capability of the satellite  circuit failures that reduce the power output of the solar array panels on the satellites  failure of the battery cells that power the payload and spacecraft operations during daily solar eclipse periods  power system failures that result in a shut down or loss of the satellite  attitude control system failures that degrade or cause the inoperability of the satellite  transmitter or receiver failures that degrade or cause the inability of the satellite to communicate with subscriber communicator units or gateway earth stations communications system failures that affect overall system capacity  and satellite computer or processor failures that impair or cause the inoperability of the satellites 

table of contents equipment degradation during the satellite s lifetime  including degradation of the batteries ability to accept a full charge  degradation of solar array panels due to radiation  and general degradation resulting from operating in the harsh space environment 
deficiencies of control or communications software  including failure of the charging algorithm that may damage the satellite s batteries  problems with the communications and messaging servicing functions of the satellite  and limitations on the satellite s digital signal processing capability that limit satellite communications capacity 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  anomalies in some of the categories described above  including with respect to the cds and five quick launch satellites 
see the orbcomm communications system system status satellite impairments and insurance recovery 
the continued operation of the remaining two deployed quick launch satellites is important to us to leverage our work with ais to then resell ais data collected by our satellites  as well as to augment our current satellite constellation 
in addition  these new satellites were intended to supplement and ultimately replace our existing plane a satellites and is important to maintain adequate service levels and to provide additional capacity for future subscriber growth 
a failure of any of our remaining deployed quick launch satellites could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the effects of these anomalies include  but are not limited to  failure of the satellite  degraded communications performance  reduced power available to the satellite in sunlight and or eclipse  battery overcharging or undercharging and limitations on satellite communications capacity 
some of these effects may be increased during periods of greater message traffic and could result in our system requiring more than one attempt to send messages before they get through to our satellites 
although these effects do not result in lost messages  they could lead to increased messaging latencies for the end user and reduced throughput for our system 
see the orbcomm communications system system status network capacity for a description of our network capacity 
while we have already implemented a number of system adjustments we cannot assure you that these actions will succeed or adequately address the effects of any anomalies in a timely manner or at all 
a total of first generation satellites were launched by orbcomm global lp and of these  a total of remain operational 
our plane f polar satellite  one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in  was retired in april due to intermittent service 
two additional satellites one from each of plane b and plane d were retired in also due to intermittent service 
the other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures early in their lifetime and the previous mission ending satellite failure affecting our system occurred in october  prior to our acquisition of the satellite constellation 
the absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity 
while certain software deficiencies may be corrected remotely  most  if not all  of the satellite anomalies or debris collision damage cannot be corrected once the satellites are placed in orbit 
see the orbcomm communications system system status first generation for a description of the operational status and anomalies that affect our satellites 
we may experience additional anomalies in the future  whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components  and operational redundancy may not be available upon the occurrence of such an anomaly 
our system could fail to perform or perform at reduced levels of service because of technological malfunctions  satellite failures or deficiencies or events outside of our control  which would seriously harm our business and reputation 
our system is exposed to the risks inherent in a large scale  complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology 
any disruption to our services  information systems or communication networks or those of third parties into which our network connects could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time 
satellite anomalies and other technical and operational deficiencies of our communications system described in this annual report on form k could result in system failures or reduced levels of service 
in addition  certain components of our system are located in foreign countries  and as a result  are potentially subject to governmental  regulatory or other actions in such countries which could force us to limit the 
table of contents operations of  or completely shut down  components of our system  including gateway earth stations or subscriber communicators 
any disruption to our services or extended periods of reduced levels of service could  and increased latencies in our satellite network delivering messages have and could continue to  cause us to lose customers or revenue  result in delays or cancellations of future implementations of our products and services  result in failure to attract customers or could result in litigation  customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating our business 
the failure of any of the diverse and dispersed elements of our system  including our satellites  our network control center  our gateway earth stations  our gateway control centers or our subscriber communicators  to function and coordinate as required could render our system unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success 
any system failures or extended reduced levels of service could reduce our sales  increase costs or result in liability claims and seriously harm our business 
we do not currently have back up facilities for our network control center 
in the event of a general failure at our network control center  our system will be disrupted and our operations will be harmed 
the core control segment of our system is housed at our primary isp providers data center located in sterling  virginia 
we currently do not have back up facilities for certain essential command and control functions that are performed by our network control center  and as a result  our system and business operations remain vulnerable to the possibility of a failure at our network control center 
there would be a severe disruption to the functionality of our system in the event of a failure at our network control center 
although we plan to install a back up network control center in  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the installation on a timely basis or that such a back up network would eliminate disruption to our system in the event of a failure 
all operational satellites are subject to the possibility to be impacted by space debris or another spacecraft 
collisions with space debris or other spacecraft  could materially affect system performance and our business 
our satellites do not have the ability to actively maneuver to avoid potential impact by space debris or other satellites 
on february  a satellite owned by iridium satellite llc and russia s cosmos collided in an orbital altitude similar to ours causing an increase in risk of space debris damaging or interfering with the operation of our satellites 
much of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateway earth stations was designed and manufactured over ten years ago and could be more difficult and expensive to service  upgrade or replace 
much of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateway earth stations was designed and manufactured over ten years ago and portions are becoming obsolete 
as they continue to age  they may become less reliable and will be more difficult and expensive to service  upgrade or replace 
although we maintain inventories of some spare parts  it nonetheless may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary replacement parts for the hardware 
our business plan contemplates updating or replacing some of the hardware and software in our network  however  the age of our existing hardware and software may present us with technical and operational challenges that complicate or otherwise make it not feasible to carry out our planned upgrades and replacements  and the expenditure of resources  both from a monetary and human capital perspective  may exceed our estimates 
without upgrading and replacing our equipment  obsolescence of the technologies that we use could have a material adverse affect on our revenues  profitability and liquidity 
technical or other difficulties with our gateway earth stations could harm our business 
our system relies in part on the functionality of our gateway earth stations  some of which are owned and maintained by third parties 
while we believe that the overall health of the majority of our gateway earth stations remains stable  we have and may continue to experience technical difficulties or parts obsolescence with our gateway earth stations which negatively impact service in the region covered by that gateway earth station 
certain problems with these gateway earth stations have and may continue to reduce their availability and negatively impact the performance of our system in that region 
for example  the owner of the malaysian gateway earth station has been unable to raise sufficient capital to properly maintain this gateway earth station 
we are also experiencing commercial disputes with the entities that own the gateway earth stations in south america  korea and kazakhstan 
in  the international gateway earth stations located in malaysia  south america and kazakhstan experienced intermittent outages 
we refurbished and replaced various components at the malaysian gateway earth station to 
table of contents address the outages 
in  we expect to perform similar refurbishment activities at the kazakhstan and south american gateway earth stations 
in addition  due to regulatory and licensing constraints in certain countries in which we operate  we are unable to wholly own or majority own some of the gateway earth stations in our system located outside the united states 
as a result of these ownership restrictions  we rely on third parties to own and operate some of these gateway earth stations 
if our relationship with these third parties deteriorates or if these third parties are unable or unwilling to bear the cost of operating or maintaining the gateway earth stations  or if there are changes in the applicable domestic regulations that require us to give up any or all of our ownership interests in any of the gateway earth stations  our control over our system could be diminished and our business could be harmed 
rapid and significant technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair our competitive position and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures 
the space and communications industries are subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology 
we expect to face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems 
new technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying customer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards 
particular technological developments that could adversely affect us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power  flexibility  efficiency or capabilities than our current constellation or our next generation satellites  as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies 
for us to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive  we may need to make significant capital expenditures 
customer acceptance of the products and services that we offer will continually be affected by technology based differences in our product and service offerings compared to those of our competitors 
new technologies may be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws and therefore may not be available to us 
any failure by us to implement new technology within our system may compromise our ability to compete 
our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks 
we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations 
our network and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other security problems 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions  delays or malfunctions in our operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems  including reputational harm and litigation  caused by any breaches 
although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement security measures  these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could lower network operations center availability  which could harm our business 
risks related to an investment in our common stock the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile and your investment may decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
further  our common stock has a limited trading history 
factors that could affect the trading price of our common stock include further failure of our current or future satellites or a delay in the launch of our next generation satellites  liquidity of the market in  and demand for  our common stock  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial or subscriber growth estimates  if any  of market analysts  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  including quarterly results  our financial or subscriber growth performance failing to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  our ability to raise additional funds to meet our capital needs  the outcome of any litigation by or against us  including any judgments favorable or adverse to us  
table of contents conditions and trends in the end markets we serve and changes in the estimation of the size and growth rate of these markets  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors  investor perception of our prospects  our industry and the markets in which we operate  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  loss of one or more of our significant customers  changes in governmental regulation  changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors  investor perception of and confidence in capital markets and equity investments  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for telecommunications companies in particular  have experienced and continue to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation has previously been instituted against us and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
in  two securities firms ceased providing research coverage of our company and our business 
in  one additional securities firm ceased providing such research coverage 
if we do not continue to maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions which could affect the price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions do not permit actions by our stockholders by written consent and require the approval of the holders of at least of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
in addition  these provisions include procedural requirements relating to stockholder meetings and stockholder proposals that could make stockholder actions more difficult 
our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors serving staggered  three year terms and may be removed only for cause 
any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the vote of the majority of directors then in office 
our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer  effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more for our outstanding common stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 

table of contents if persons engage in short sales of our common stock  the price of our common stock may decline 
selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security 
a significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security 
further sales of common stock could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market  which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock 
holders of our securities could  therefore  experience a decline in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock 
we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and  because we currently intend to retain all cash we generate to fund the growth of our business  we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any future dividend payments would be within the discretion of our board of directors and would depend on a variety of factors  including our results of operations  working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  financial condition  contractual restrictions  business opportunities  anticipated cash needs  provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
we may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock

organization orbcomm llc was organized as a delaware limited liability company on april  and on april   we acquired substantially all of the non cash assets and assumed certain liabilities of orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries  which had filed for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the assets acquired from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries consisted principally of the in orbit satellites and supporting us ground infrastructure equipment that we own today 
at the same time  orbcomm llc also entered an agreement that resulted in the acquisition of the fcc licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of orbital sciences corporation  which was not in bankruptcy  in a related transaction 
prior to april   orbcomm llc did not have any operating activities 
we were formed as a delaware corporation in october and on february   the members of orbcomm llc contributed all of their outstanding membership interests in orbcomm llc to us in exchange for shares of our common stock  representing ownership interests in us equal in proportion to their prior ownership interest in orbcomm llc 
as a result of  and immediately following the contribution  orbcomm llc became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
overview we operate a global commercial wireless messaging system optimized for narrowband communications 
our system consists of a global network of low earth orbit  or leo  satellites and accompanying ground infrastructure 
our two way communications system enables our customers and end users  which include large and established multinational businesses and government agencies  to track  monitor  control and communicate cost 
table of contents effectively with fixed and mobile assets located anywhere in the world 
we also provide terrestrial based cellular communication services through reseller agreements with major cellular wireless providers which include gsm and cdma offerings 
these terrestrial based communication services enable our customers who have higher bandwidth requirements to receive and send messages from communication devices based on terrestrial based technologies using the cellular providers wireless networks as well as from dual mode devices combining our satellite subscriber communicators with devices for terrestrial based technologies 
as a result  our customers are now able to integrate into their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from the cellular providers wireless networks 
our products and services enable our customers and end users to enhance productivity  reduce costs and improve security through a variety of commercial  government  and emerging homeland security applications 
we enable our customers and end users to achieve these benefits using a single global satellite technology standard for machine to machine and telematic  or mm  data communications 
our customers have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
examples of assets that are connected through our mm data communications system include trucks  trailers  railcars  containers  heavy equipment  fluid tanks  utility meters  pipeline monitoring equipment  marine vessels  and oil wells 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as caterpillar  doosan infracore america  hitachi  hyundai heavy industries  komatsu  the manitowoc company and volvo construction equipment  ivars  such as asset intelligence now a subsidiary of id systems and formerly a division of ge  vars  such as xata corporation and american innovations  ltd  and government agencies  such as the us coast guard 
the recent global economic conditions  including concerns about a global economic recession  along with unprecedented credit and capital constraints in the capital markets and deteriorations of financial institutions have created a challenging economic environment leading to a lack of customer confidence 
our worldwide operations and performance depend significantly on global economic conditions and their impact on our customers decisions to purchase our services and products 
economic conditions have worsened significantly in many parts of the world  and may remain weak or even deteriorate further in the foreseeable future 
the worldwide economic turmoil may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results  and we may be unable to predict the scope and magnitude of its effects on our business 
vars and end users in any of our target markets  including in commercial transportation and heavy equipment  have and may experience unexpected fluctuations in demand for their products  as our end users alter purchasing activities in response to this economic volatility 
our customers may change or scale back product development efforts  the roll out of service applications  product purchases or other sales activities that affect purchases of our products and services  and this could adversely affect the amount and timing of revenue for the long term future  leaving us with limited visibility in the revenue we can anticipate in any given period 
these economic conditions also affect our third party manufacturers  and if they are unable to obtain the necessary capital to operate their business  this may also impact their ability to provide the subscriber communicators that our end users need  or may adversely affect their ability to provide timely services or to make timely deliveries of products or services to our end users 
it is currently unclear as to what overall effect these economic conditions and uncertainties will have on our existing customers and core markets  and future business with existing and new customers in our current and future markets 
starting in the fourth quarter of and during  we experienced a slowing of demand by several vars across our core markets 
it is currently unclear as to what overall effect these economic conditions and uncertainties will have on our existing customers and core markets  and future business with existing and new customers in our current and future markets 
as of december   we had approximately  billable subscriber communicators activated on our communications system compared to approximately  billable subscriber communicators as of december   an increase of approximately 
satellite replenishment the majority of our current fleet of satellites was put in service in the late s and has an estimated operating life of approximately nine to twelve years 
since  we have implemented several operational changes and software demonstration updates that we believe have enhanced the expected life of the satellites 
the majority of 
table of contents these changes focus on extending the life of the primary life limiting component the nickel hydrogen batteries which power the satellites 
through a series of launches  we intend to replenish the existing constellation of satellites with next generation satellites  which depending on the capabilities of the replacement satellites  which may require fewer satellites than we currently have 
flexibility in the number of satellites per launch  the number of satellites inserted into each plane and target plane may allow us to modify our plans within just a few months before launch 
in addition  we have required snc our manufacturer for our next generation satellites to include options to order additional satellites if the market demands such an increase or if lower latencies are required or to mitigate a launch failure 
we intend to launch next generation satellites equipped with increased communications capabilities and our ais payload currently being constructed by snc with the first of several launches using multiple spacex falcon e launch vehicles based on our agreement with spacex  our launch service provider 
the agreement with spacex anticipates that the launch services will be performed between the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  subject to certain rights of us and the launch service provider to reschedule any of the following launch services as needed 
the agreement also provides us the option to procure  prior to each launch service  reflight launch services whereby in the event the applicable launch service results in a failure due to the spacex launch vehicle  our launch service provider will provide comparable reflight launch services at no additional cost to us beyond the initial option price for such reflight launch services 
for the year ended  we spent million on capital expenditures  of which million was for the next generation satellites including million for the launch services contract  million was for the quick launch satellites and million was for the coast guard demonstration satellite 
for the year ended  we spent million on capital expenditures  of which million was for the next generation satellites  million was for the quick launch and million was for the coast guard demonstration satellite 
for the year ended  we spent million on capital expenditures  of which million was for the coast guard demonstration satellite and million was for the quick launch satellites 
satellite impairments and insurance recovery on june   the coast guard demonstration satellite and five quick launch satellites were launched 
due to continued delays associated with the construction of the final quick launch satellite  we are retaining it for future deployment 
since launch  communications capability for three of the quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite has been lost as described below 
in august  we placed the remaining two quick launch satellites in service for which we maintain communications capability 
these satellites are providing limited orbcomm messaging and worldwide ais services 
these satellites are experiencing attitude control system anomalies which result in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected 
these pointing errors result in reduced power generation  improper satellite spacing within the orbital plane and reduced communications capabilities 
one of these satellites has an intermittent flight computer anomaly and a power system anomaly which has significantly reduced its availability 
the similarity of these satellites to the failed satellites described below is believed to significantly reduce their expected useful lives to three and five months 
on february   one quick launch satellite experienced a power system anomaly that subsequently resulted in a loss of contact with the satellite 
after consultation with ohb and our own engineers  we believe that after an extended period of no communication with the satellite  the satellite was not recoverable 
a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of this satellite of million was recognized during the first quarter of on july   another quick launch satellite experienced a gateway transmitter anomaly that resulted in a loss of contact with the satellite by our ground control systems 
after consulting with our engineers  we believe that the gateway transmitter will not be recovered  resulting in an inability to provide orbcomm messaging and ais data services by this satellite 
a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of this satellite of million was recognized during the third quarter of 
table of contents on august   another quick launch satellite experienced a power system anomaly 
subsequently  on august   the coast guard demonstration satellite also experienced an anomaly with its power system 
these anomalies resulted in a loss of contact with the satellites 
after consulting with ohb and our own engineers  we believe that after such an extended period of no communication with the satellites  it is unlikely that the satellites will be recovered based on its experience with earlier satellites with which contact was similarly lost 
a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of these satellites of million was recorded for a total impairment charge of million recognized during the third quarter of during the quarter ended december   we recorded an additional non cash impairment charge of million 
the loss of these satellites can result in longer latencies in transmitting messages but is not otherwise expected to have a material adverse effect on the current communications service as the satellites were not in full operational service 
the remaining two quick launch satellites are equipped with an ais payload that provides redundant capabilities for our ais data service  and we will be relying on these satellites to provide ais data service 
if these satellites also fail  we will not be able to provide ais data service  including under existing contracts  unless we are able to procure other ais data service from third parties or until the launch of our ais payload equipped next generation satellites  scheduled as early as the end of we purchased an in orbit insurance policy that covers the total loss or constructive total loss of the coast guard demonstration satellite and five quick launch satellites during the coverage period that ended on june  under the terms of the policy  a satellite that does not meet the working satellite criteria constitutes a constructive total loss of that satellite for insurance purposes 
the in orbit insurance is subject to certain exclusions including a deductible under which no claim is payable under the policy for the first satellite to suffer a constructive total loss or total loss 
we filed a claim under our in orbit insurance policy for all six satellites as either a total loss or constructive total loss 
the total loss claim was for the one satellite that suffered a power system failure resulting in loss of contact in february  and the constructive total loss claim for each of the other five satellites is on the basis that these satellites did not meet the working satellite criteria stated in the policy 
the maximum amount recoverable by us under the policy from third party insurers for all six satellites covered by the policy was million  after taking into account the one satellite deductible  under which no claim is payable for the first satellite to suffer a constructive total loss or total loss  and less any salvage value that can be established 
on december   we and the third party insurers entered into a settlement and release agreement to settle any and all claims relating to the coast guard demonstration satellite and the five quick launch satellites discussed above 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we received million from the third party insurers 
in addition  each of the insurers has waived all rights  title and interest in and to the coast guard demonstration satellite and the five quick launch satellites 
as a result  we recorded a million insurance recovery in our consolidated statements of operations in orbcomm japan on march   we received a equity interest in orbcomm japan  which was accounted for an investment in affiliates at march  orbcomm japan s results of operations were not significant for the period from march  through march  on may   we received an additional equity interest in japan and  as a result  our ownership interest increased to 
on june   we entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling stockholder  which terminated its substantive participatory rights in the governance of orbcomm japan and as a result  we obtained the controlling interest in orbcomm japan 
we consolidated the results of orbcomm japan as though the controlling interest was acquired on april  and therefore deducted million of orbcomm japan s earnings for the period prior to june  the date we acquired our controlling interest from our results of continuing operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents discontinued operations we are focused on our network business and are in the process of discussing with interested parties about a sale of our subsidiary  stellar satellite communications  ltd 
stellar 
the ge settlement agreement and the services agreement discussed below provides us with the ability to dispose of stellar without disrupting orbcomm s growth prospects with ge and allows us to concentrate on our service based data communications business 
as a result  we classified stellar s assets and liabilities as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and presented stellar s results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented 
we expect to complete a sale of stellar during see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
on april   we entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with ge with respect to the supply agreement dated october  the agreement to supply up to  units of in production and future models of subscriber communicators through december  to support ge s applications utilizing our data communications system 
 of these units were non cancelable except for specified early termination provisions 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we received million as settlement for ge s obligation under the agreement 
ge did not purchase its minimum committed volumes for and in  we recognized a gain of million for customer claims settlements in loss from discontinued operations 
we and ge terminated the agreement and all their respective obligations relating to it  and released each other from any claims relating to their obligations arising under the agreement  except for certain obligations related to warranties  indemnities  confidentiality and intellectual property 
ge concurrent with the settlement agreement  we and ge entered into a services agreement the services agreement with a term of january  through december  pursuant to which we and ge agreed to expand the scope of services provided or that may in the future be provided to include other satellite  cellular or dual mode cellular plus satellite data communications services  in addition to the low earth orbit satellite based data communication services the low earth services 
under the services agreement  ge will activate and provide telematics and machine to machine data communications services on all communicators sold or managed by or on behalf of ge in the united states  canada and mexico for purposes of communications between i subscriber communicators sold or managed by or on behalf of ge s asset tracking and monitoring business and ii communications centers or customers of ge s asset tracking and monitoring business  whether satellite  cellular or dual mode cellular plus satellite  exclusively subject to certain restrictions and qualifications on orbcomm s communications system that provides the low earth services and terrestrial based cellular communication services through reseller agreements with major cellular wireless providers and that may in the future provide communication services through other third party communication networks in each case as long as we provide competitive services at competitive rates with appropriate regulatory approval  subject to the terms of the services agreement 
ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings attributable to orbcomm inc  before interest income expense  provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to our management and investors in evaluating our operating performance because it is one of the primary measures we use to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations  including our ability to obtain and maintain our customers  our ability to operate our business effectively  the efficiency of our employees and the profitability associated with their performance 
it also helps our management and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period on a consistent basis by removing the impact of our financing transactions and the depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from our operating results 
in addition  our management uses ebitda in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management and for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget 

table of contents ebitda is not a performance measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
while we consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  net loss or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different than ebitda measures presented by other companies 
the following table reconciles our net loss to ebitda for the periods shown years ended december  in thousands net loss attributable to orbcomm inc interest income interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda in improved by million over this improvement was due to recognizing a net gain of million on insurance settlement  higher net service revenues of million and a gain of million for customer claims settlement from ge reported in loss from discontinued operations  a decrease of million in stock based compensation offset by an increase in operating expenses of million from the full year consolidation of orbcomm japan for million  million of a satellite insurance policy  million for bad debt reserves  unanticipated expenses of million for a contested proxy vote  million in severance payments and million in legal fees related to the preparation of our satellite insurance claim 
ebitda in improved by million over including million from orbcomm japan 
this improvement was due to an increase in net service revenues of million  offset by increases in operating expenses of million  foreign exchange currency losses of million and noncontrolling interests and pre control earnings of orbcomm japan of million from april  operating expenses increased in primarily due to an increase in facility costs of million and million from orbcomm japan 
these increases were offset by a gain of million primarily from the settlement of claims against orbcomm japan and a million reduction in operating expenses associated with an asset purchase option 
revenues we derive service revenues from our resellers and direct customers from utilization of satellite subscriber communicators on our communications system and the reselling of airtime from the utilization of terrestrial based subscriber communicators using sims on the cellular providers wireless networks 
these service revenues generally consist of a one time activation fee for each subscriber communicator and sims activated for use on our communications system and monthly usage fees 
usage fees that we charge our customers are based upon the number  size and frequency of data transmitted by the customer and the overall number of subscriber communicators and sims activated by each customer 
revenues for usage fees from currently billing subscriber communicators and sims are recognized on an accrual basis  as services are rendered  or on a cash basis  if collection from the customer is not reasonably assured at the time the service is provided 
usage fees charged to our resellers and direct customers are charged primarily at wholesale rates based on the overall number of subscriber communicators activated by them and the total amount of data transmitted 
service revenues also includes ais data transmissions  services to the uscg described below  royalty fees from third parties for the use of our proprietary communications protocol charged on a one time basis for each satellite subscriber communicator connected to our mm data communications system and fees from providing engineering  technical and management support services to customers 
we derive product revenues primarily from sales of subscriber communicators to our resellers ie  our vars  ivars  international licensees and country representatives and direct customers and other equipment such as gateway earth stations and related products to customers 
during the third quarter of  we began selling cellular 
table of contents wireless subscriber identity modules  or sims  for our terrestrial communication services to our resellers and direct customers 
during  we entered into an agreement with the uscg to design  develop  launch and operate a single satellite equipped with the capability to receive  process and forward ais data the concept validation project 
under the terms of the agreement  title to the concept validation project demonstration satellite remains with us  however the uscg is granted a non exclusive  royalty free license to use the intellectual property related to the designs  processes and procedures developed under the agreement in connection with any of our future satellites that are ais enabled 
we are permitted to use the concept validation project demonstration satellite 
the agreement provides for post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services to be provided by us to the uscg for an initial term of months and an additional option to receive post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services subsequent to the initial term 
in  the uscg elected to receive the additional post launch maintenance and ais data transmissions services options for months to continue receiving service from the remaining two quick launch satellites 
costs and expenses we own and operate a satellite constellation  six of the fifteen gateway earth stations and two of the four gateway control centers 
satellite based communications systems are typically characterized by high initial capital expenditures and relatively low marginal costs for providing service 
because we acquired substantially all of our existing satellite and network assets from orbcomm global lp for a fraction of their original cost in a bankruptcy court approved sale  we have benefited from lower amortization of capital costs than if the assets were acquired at orbcomm global lp s original cost 
these satellites became fully depreciated during the fourth quarter of in  as discussed above  under overview satellite impairments and insurance recovery  communications capability for three of the quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite were lost 
as a result  we recognized non cash impairment charges of million in our consolidated statements of operations 
in december  we entered into a settlement and release agreement with the third party insurers with respect to our in orbit insurance policy and received million 
we recorded the million as an insurance recovery satellite network in our consolidated statements of operations 
in august  we placed the remaining two quick launch satellites in service and began depreciating these satellites over their expected useful lives of three and five months as these two satellites are experiencing similar anomalies to the three quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite that are expected to be permanent and significantly reduce their expected useful lives 
as a result our depreciation expense  a component of cost of services  increased significantly in this was primarily due to million of depreciation expense relating to the two remaining quick launch satellites 
we currently anticipate that when the next generation satellites are placed in service in they will be depreciated over a period of ten years  representing the estimated operational lives of the satellites 
we incur engineering expenses associated with the operation of our communications system and the development and support of new applications  as well as sales  marketing and administrative expenses related to the operation of our business 
as of december   we have employees and we do not expect a significant increase in critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  costs of revenues  accounts receivable  satellite network and other equipment  capitalized development costs  intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  uncertain tax positions 
table of contents and the value of securities underlying stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policy requires us to make significant judgments regarding the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance based on prior history and the creditworthiness of our customers 
in instances where collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when we receive cash from the customer 
revenues generated from the sale of satellite subscriber communicators  sims and other products are either recognized when the products are shipped or when customers accept the products  depending on the specific contractual terms 
sales of satellite subscriber communicators and sims and other items are not subject to return and title and risk of loss pass to the customer at the time of shipment 
sales of subscriber communicators and sims are primarily to resellers and are not bundled with service arrangements 
revenues from sales of gateway earth stations and related products are recognized only upon installation  customer acceptance and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from the activation of subscriber communicators and sims are initially recorded as deferred revenues and are  thereafter  recognized ratably over the term of the agreement with the customer  generally three years which is the estimated customer relationship period 
revenues generated from monthly usage and administrative fees and engineering services are recognized when the services are rendered 
revenues generated from royalties under our subscriber communicator manufacturing agreements are recognized when we issue to a third party manufacturer upon request a unique serial number to be assigned to each unit manufactured by such third party manufacturer 
under of our agreement with the uscg with respect to the concept validation project and related services  described under overview revenues  as no tangible deliverable other than services will be provided to the uscg and we retain title to the coast guard demonstration satellite  the arrangement is accounted for as a long term service arrangement 
the deliverables under the agreement with the uscg do not qualify as separate units of accounting 
commencing with acceptance of the ais data by the uscg in august  the revenues related to the design and development of the satellite  initial post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services are being recognized ratably over six years  the expected life of the customer relationship 
in august  the uscg elected to receive the subsequent post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services options to continue receiving service from the remaining two quick launch satellites 
these services are being recognized ratably over the remaining expected life of the customer relationship 
for arrangements with multiple obligations eg  deliverable and undeliverable products  and other post contract support  we allocate revenues to each component of the contract based upon objective evidence of each component s fair value 
we recognize revenues allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenues set forth above are met 
if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligations is not available  the arrangement consideration allocable to a delivered item is combined with the amount allocable to the undelivered item s within the arrangement 
revenues are recognized as the remaining obligations are fulfilled 
out of pocket expenses incurred during the performance of professional service contracts are included in costs of services and any amounts re billed to clients are included in revenues during the period in which they are incurred 
shipping costs billed to customers are included in product sales revenues and the related costs are included as costs of product sales 

table of contents amounts received prior to the performance of services under customer contracts are recognized as deferred revenues and revenue recognition is deferred until such time that all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
costs of product sales and services costs of services is comprised of payroll and related costs  including stock based compensation  materials and supplies  depreciation and amortization of assets used to provide services and usage fees to cellular wireless providers for the data transmitted by the resellers on our network 
costs of product sales includes the purchase price of subscriber communicators and sims sold and shipping charges 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are due in accordance with payment terms included in our negotiated contracts 
amounts due are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we make ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable to determine our required allowances based on a number of factors such as the age of the receivable  credit history of the customer  historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
past experience may not be indicative of future collections  as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts may deviate from our estimates as a percentage of accounts receivable and sales 
satellite network and other equipment satellite network and other equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we use judgment to determine the useful life of our satellite network based on the estimated operational life of the satellites and periodic reviews of engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network 
satellite network includes the costs of our constellation of satellites  and the ground and control segments  which consists of gateway earth stations  gateway control centers and the network control center the ground segment 
assets under construction primarily consist of milestone payments pursuant to procurement agreements  which includes the design  development  launch and other direct costs relating to the construction of the satellites and upgrades to the company s infrastructure and the ground segment 
once these assets are placed in service they will be transferred to satellite network and then depreciation will be recognized using the straight line method over the estimated lives of the assets 
no depreciation has been recorded on these assets as of december  long lived assets management reviews long lived assets  including license rights for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in connection with this review  we reevaluate the periods of depreciation and amortization 
we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is determined using the projected discounted future net cash flows 
we measure fair value by discounting estimated future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
considerable judgment by us is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows 
capitalized development costs judgments and estimates occur in the calculation of capitalized development costs 
we evaluate and estimate when a preliminary project stage is completed and at the point when the project is substantially complete and ready for use 
we base our estimates and evaluations on engineering data 
we capitalize the costs of acquiring  developing 
table of contents and testing software to meet our internal needs 
capitalization of costs associated with software obtained or developed for internal use commences when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has authorized further funding for the project  based on a determination that it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct cost of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with  and devote time to  the internal use software project 
capitalization of such costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
internal use software costs are amortized once the software is placed in service using the straight line method over periods ranging from one to five years 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
judgment is applied in determining whether the recoverability of our deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
a valuation allowance is established for the amount of deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
realization of our deferred tax assets may depend upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
effective january   we adopted the accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
also this guidance provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties and disclosures of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
in the first step  recognition  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable  or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be de recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
accounting for uncertainties in income taxes positions involves significant judgments by management 
during the years ended december  and  we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
during the year ended december   we recognized uncertain tax benefits totaling million 
due to the existence of our valuation allowance the uncertain tax benefits if recognized would not impact our effective income tax rate 
we are subject to us federal and state examinations by tax authorities for all years from we do not expect any significant changes to its unrecognized tax positions during the next twelve months 
discontinued operations we classify a component as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations when it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale  or it has been disposed of 
beginning in the second quarter of  we classified the assets and liabilities of stellar as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and their results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented 
we expect to complete a sale of stellar during the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of 
table of contents cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are no longer being depreciated 
the ultimate value to be realized will depend on the final offer and negotiated sales price realized for the component when it is sold 
loss contingencies we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
share based compensation our share based compensation plans consist of the long term incentives plan the ltip and the stock option plan 
the ltip approved by our stockholders in september  provides for the grants of non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  common stock  restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus  performance units and performance shares to our employees and non employee directors the stock option plan  adopted in  provides for the grants of non qualified and incentive stock options to officers  directors  employees and consultants 
we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  an evaluation is made at the grant date and future periods as to the likelihood of the performance criteria being met 
compensation expense is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the performance condition until the vesting date 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
for the years ended december   and stock based compensation expense was not significant in our discontinued operations 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of unrecognized compensation costs for all share based payment arrangements 
we expect that our planned use of share based payment arrangements will continue to be a significant expense for us in future periods 
we have not recognized  and do not expect to recognize in the near future  any tax benefit related to employee stock based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards 
the grant date fair value of the performance and time based rsu awards granted in  and are based upon the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each time and performance based sar award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the assumptions described below for the periods indicated 
expected volatility was based on the stock volatility for comparable publicly traded companies 
we use the simplified method based on the average of the vesting term and the contractual term to calculate the expected life of each sar award 
estimated forfeitures were based on voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of 
table of contents actual sar forfeitures 
the risk free interest rate was based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of the grant over the expected term of the sar grants 
years ended december  risk free interest rate to to expected life years and and estimated volatility factor and to expected dividends none none none stock option plan in  and we did not grant any stock options

the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve capital  maintain sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements while at the same time maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
due to the high investment quality and short duration of these marketable securities  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however will reduce future income 
a hypothetical movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on interest income
