item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our investment strategies our results of operations depend on the performance of our investment strategies 
poor performance of our investment strategies will reduce or minimize the value of our assets under management  on which our advisory fees are based 
since advisory fees comprise all of our operating revenues  poor performance of our investment strategies will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  poor performance will make it difficult for us to retain or attract clients and to grow our business 
the performance of our strategies is subject to some or all of the following risks 
our classic value investments subject the performance of our investment strategies to the risk that the companies in which we invest may not achieve the level of earnings recovery that we initially expect  or at all 
we generally invest in companies after they have experienced a shortfall in their historic earnings  due to an adverse business development  management error  accounting scandal or other disruption  and before there is clear evidence of earnings recovery or business momentum 
while very few investors are willing to invest when companies lack earnings visibility  our classic value investment approach seeks to capture the return that can be obtained by investing in a company before the market has a level of confidence in its ability to achieve earnings recovery 
however  our investment approach entails the risk that the companies included in our portfolios are not able to execute the turnaround that we had expected when we originally invested in them  thereby reducing the performance of our strategies 
since our positions in these investments are often substantial  there is the risk that we may be unable to find willing purchasers for our investments when we decide to sell them 
most of our strategies construct concentrated portfolios  generally ranging from to holdings  of companies underperforming their historical earnings power  which is subject to a higher risk of underperformance relative to benchmarks than the investment approaches of some of our competitors 
since we apply the same investment process across all of our investment strategies  utilizing one team  and given the overlapping universes of many of our investment strategies  we could have common positions and industry or sector concentrations across many of our investment strategies at the same time 
as such  factors leading one of our investment strategies to underperform may lead other strategies to underperform simultaneously 
our investment strategies may not obtain attractive returns in certain periods or during certain market conditions 
our products are best suited for investors with long term investment horizons 
in order for our classic value investment approach to yield attractive returns  we must typically hold securities for an average of over three years 
our investment strategies may not perform well during certain periods of time 
in addition  our strategies may not perform well during points in the economic cycle when value oriented stocks are relatively less attractive 
for instance  during the late stages of an economic cycle  investors may purchase relatively expensive stocks in order to obtain access to above average growth  as was the case in the late s 
value oriented strategies may also experience weakness during periods when the markets are focused on one investment thesis or sector 
in  and  our investment strategies underperformed their respective benchmarks  and there can be no assurance that such underperformance will not occur in future periods 
our investment approach may underperform other investment approaches  which may result in significant withdrawals of client assets or client departures or a reduction in our aum 
even when securities prices are rising generally  portfolio performance can be affected by our investment approach 
we employ a classic value investment approach in all of our investment strategies 
this investment approach has outperformed the market in some economic and market environments and underperformed it in others 
in particular  a prolonged period in which the growth style of investing outperforms the value style may cause our investment strategy to go out of favor with some clients  consultants or third party intermediaries 
our investment strategy may be less favored during certain time periods for other reasons as well  including due to perceived riskiness or volatility of our approach 
poor performance relative to peers  coupled with changes in personnel  extensive periods in particular market environments  or other difficulties may result in significant withdrawals of client assets  client departures or a reduction in our aum 
the recessionary environment has  and may continue to  negatively affect the companies in which we invest 
despite recent governmental efforts to stimulate the economy  the recessionary environment may continue 
the recent disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the economy and the financial markets has created difficult conditions for most companies  including many of those in which we invest 
the recessionary environment that the united states and the world face as a result of these factors has had the effect of pushing the prices of equity securities in which we invest lower than their historical levels 
in addition  the recessionary environment has had the effect of reducing the funds available to our clients to invest 
both of these trends could continue to reduce our aum  which is the main driver of our revenues and profitability 
the federal government has implemented a host of programs intended to stimulate the economy and unclog credit markets 
the ultimate effect of these governmental programs is unknown at this time and  despite their enactment and implementation  the recessionary environment may not improve for some time  or may deteriorate  either of which could materially adversely affect the companies in which we invest  the economy in general and our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as the trading price of our common stock 
our investment process requires us to conduct extensive fundamental research on any company before investing in it  which may result in missed investment opportunities and reduce the performance of our investment strategies 
we take a considerable amount of time to complete the in depth research projects that our investment process requires before adding any security to our portfolio 
our process requires that we take this time in order to understand the company and the business well enough to make an informed decision as to whether we are willing to own a significant position in a company whose current earnings are below its historic norms and that does not yet have earnings visibility 
however  the time we take to make this judgment may cause us to miss the opportunity to invest in a company that has a sharp and rapid earnings recovery 
any such missed investment opportunities could adversely impact the performance of our investment strategies 
our global value  eafe value  global diversified value  eafe diversified value  european value and emerging markets value strategies consist primarily of investments in the securities of issuers located outside of the united states  which may involve foreign currency exchange  political  social and economic uncertainties and risks 
our global value  eafe value  global diversified value  eafe diversified value  european value and emerging markets value strategies  which together represented billion and billion of our aum as of december  and december   respectively  and may comprise a larger portion of our aum in the future  are primarily invested in securities of companies located outside the united states 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact the portfolios of our clients who are invested in these strategies 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations may affect the levels of our aum from one reporting period to another 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to us currencies may result in a decrease in the dollar value of our aum  which  in turn  would result in lower us dollar denominated revenue 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities for these portfolios and continue to market these products as unhedged 
investments in non us issuers may also be effected by political  social and economic uncertainty effecting a country or region in which we are invested 
many non us financial markets are not as developed  or as efficient  as the us financial market  and  as a result  liquidity may be reduced and price volatility may be higher 
the legal and regulatory environments  including financial accounting standards and practices  may also be different  and there may be less publicly available information in respect of such companies 
these risks could adversely impact the performance of our strategies that are invested in securities of non us issuers 
risks related to our structure we are dependent upon distributions from our operating company to make distributions to our class a stockholders  and to pay taxes and other expenses 
we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership units of our operating company 
we have no independent means of generating revenue and cash flow 
our operating company is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and  as such  is not itself subject to us federal income tax 
instead  its taxable income is allocated to its members  including us  pro rata according to the number of membership units each owns 
accordingly  we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of our operating company and also incur expenses related to our operations 
we intend to cause our operating company to distribute cash to its members in an amount at least equal to that necessary to cover their tax liabilities  if any  with respect to the earnings of our operating company 
to the extent that we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations  and our operating company is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable laws or regulations  or loan agreements  or does not have sufficient earnings to make these distributions  we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and run our business and  thus  our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available to borrow under such circumstances on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we are required to pay certain former and current members of our operating company who sold to us membership units of our operating company in october  and the other holders of class b units of our operating company who subsequently have and will exchange their class b units for shares of our class a common stock most of the tax benefit of any amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we receive in connection with these sales of membership units and any future exchanges of class b units 
we used the net proceeds of our october initial public offering to purchase membership units of our operating company from three of its members  or the selling members 
these purchases have and are expected to continue to result in increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company that otherwise would not have been available 
subsequent exchanges of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock have and are expected to continue to result in increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company that otherwise would not have been available 
these increases in tax basis have and are expected to continue to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future  although the internal revenue service  or irs  might challenge all or part of this tax basis increase  and a court might sustain such a challenge 
pursuant to a tax receivable agreement dated october   among the selling members  all holders of class b units after our october initial public offering and us  we are required to pay the selling members and any holders of class b units who elect to exchange their class b units for shares of our class a common stock of the amount of the cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the increases in amortizable tax basis due to the sale to us of membership units in october and the subsequent exchanges of class b units for shares of our class a common stock 
the actual increase in tax basis  as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement  will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of exchanges  the price of our class a common stock at the time of the exchange  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable  the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable 
we expect that  as a result of the size and increases in our share of the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company attributable to our interest therein  the payments that we may make to these members likely will be substantial 
in october  each of the selling members agreed with us to waive any payments that we were required to make to them with respect to the and tax years  as a result of their sale to us of an aggregate of million membership units in october were the irs to successfully challenge the tax basis increases described above  we would not be reimbursed for any payments made under the tax receivable agreement 
as a result  in certain circumstances  we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings 
if we are deemed an investment company under the investment company act  our business would be subject to applicable restrictions under that act  which could make it impracticable for us to continue our business as contemplated 
we believe our company is not an investment company under section b of the investment company act because we are primarily engaged in a non investment company business 
we conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company 
however  if we were to be deemed an investment company  restrictions imposed by the investment company act  including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates  could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated 
risks related to our class a common stock the market price and trading volume of our class a common stock may be volatile  which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our class a common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our class a common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
if the market price of our class a common stock declines significantly  you may be unable to resell your shares of class a common stock at or above your purchase price  if at all 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our class a common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our class a common stock  or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our class a common stock  include decreases in our assets under management  variations in our quarterly operating results  failure to meet our earnings estimates  publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry  additions or departures of our key personnel  adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future  actions by stockholders  changes in market valuations of similar companies  changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations  or differing interpretations thereof  affecting our business  or enforcement of these laws and regulations  or announcements relating to these matters  adverse publicity about the asset management industry  generally  or individual scandals  specifically  and general market and economic conditions 
the market price of our class a common stock could decline due to the large number of shares of our class a common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of class b units of our operating company 
pursuant to the operating agreement of our operating company  on at least one date designated by us each year or  if we do not designate a date by september th of any year  on october th  each holder of class b units may exchange up to of its class b units for an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock  subject to certain restrictions set forth in the operating agreement 
pursuant to the resale and registration rights agreement  dated october   among the holders of class b units and us  i on at least one date designated by us each year or  if we do not designate a date by september th of any year  on a date that is three business days after october th these holders may resell the shares of class a common stock issued to them upon the exchange of up to of their class b units  and ii until october   they may only resell these shares in the manner determined by us 
we filed a form s registration statement  which became effective in february  in order to register our issuance to these holders of the total number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon exchange of all class b units outstanding immediately after the consummation of our operating company s reorganization 
we designated march  as the exchange date 
certain executive officers and employees elected to exchange an aggregate of  class b units for an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock  which  with the exception of those held by our executive officers  are freely tradable 
the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales pursuant to the form s registration statement  or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future  at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
control by our class b stockholders  which include our ceo and two presidents  of our other employees  certain outside investors and two former employees  of of the combined voting power of our common stock may give rise to conflicts of interest 
our class b stockholders collectively hold approximately of the combined voting power of our common stock 
these stockholders consist of our ceo  two presidents  of our other employees  certain unaffiliated investors and two former employees 
holders of shares of our class b common stock have entered into a class b stockholders agreement with respect to all shares of class b common stock then held by them and any additional shares of class b common stock they may acquire in the future 
pursuant to this agreement  they will vote these shares of class b common stock together on all matters submitted to a vote of our common stockholders 
to the extent that we cause our operating company to issue additional class b units  which may be granted  subject to vesting  to our employees pursuant to the pim llc equity incentive plan  these employees will be entitled to receive an equivalent number of shares of our class b common stock  subject to the condition that they agree to enter into this class b stockholders agreement 
each share of our class b common stock entitles its holder to five votes per share for so long as the class b stockholders collectively hold of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
when a class b unit is exchanged for a share of our class a common stock  an unvested class b unit is forfeited due to the employee holder s failure to satisfy the conditions of the award agreement pursuant to which it was granted  or any class b unit is forfeited as result of a breach of any restrictive covenants contained in our operating company s amended and restated operating agreement  a corresponding share of our class b common stock will automatically be redeemed by us 
for so long as our class b stockholders hold at least of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding  they will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs  including determinations with respect to acquisitions  dispositions  borrowings  issuances of securities  and the declaration and payment of dividends 
in addition  they will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring approval of stockholders  and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors  and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company 
our class b stockholders have the ability to prevent the consummation of mergers  takeovers or other transactions that may be in the best interests of our class a stockholders 
in particular  this concentration of voting power could deprive class a stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of class a common stock as part of a sale of our company  and could ultimately affect the market price of our class a common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor  which could also adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock and to designate the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of our preferred stock  each without any vote or action by our stockholders 
we could issue a series of preferred stock to impede the consummation of a merger  tender offer or other takeover attempt 
the anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may impede takeover attempts  or other transactions  that may be in the best interests of our stockholders and  in particular  our class a stockholders 
in addition  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts  or other transactions  that our stockholders may favor 
in the future  we may pay dividends to our stockholders  but our ability to do so is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure and applicable provisions of delaware law 
our board of directors may  in its discretion  reinstate the dividend in an amount to be determined by it 
subsequently  our board of directors may  in its discretion  decrease the level of dividends  or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely 
in addition  as a holding company  we depend upon the ability of pzena investment management  llc to generate earnings and cash flows and distribute them to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses and pay dividends to our stockholders 
we expect to cause pzena investment management  llc to make distributions to its members  including us 
however  the ability of pzena investment management  llc to make such distributions is subject to its operating results  cash requirements and financial condition and applicable delaware laws which may limit the amount of funds available for distribution to its members 
if  as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions  we are unable to generate sufficient distributions from our business  we may not be able to make  or may have to reduce or eliminate  the payment of dividends on our class a common stock  see item our dividend policy 
the disparity in the voting rights among the classes of our common stock may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our class a common stock 
each share of our class a common stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally  while each share of our class b common stock entitles its holder to five votes for so long as the number of shares of class b common stock represents of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
the difference in voting rights could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors view  or any potential future purchaser of our company views  the superior voting rights of the class b common stock to have value

quarter high low dividends declared per share high low dividends declared per share quarter ended march quarter ended june quarter ended september quarter ended december our dividend policy we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders  if any 
when and if our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the dividends declared 
as of december   we are no longer contractually prohibited from making dividend payments 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common stockholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends  or any of our financing facilities or other agreements restrict us from doing so 
in the future  our board of directors may  in its discretion and subject to the company s operating results  debt agreements and applicable law  reinstate the dividend at an amount to be determined by it 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an investment management firm that utilizes a classic value investment approach in each of our investment strategies 
we currently manage assets in a variety of value oriented investment strategies across a wide range of market capitalizations in both us and non us capital markets 
at december   our assets under management  or aum  were billion 
we manage separate accounts on behalf of institutions and high net worth individuals and act as sub investment adviser for a variety of sec registered mutual funds and offshore funds 
we function as the holding company through which the business of our operating company  pzena investment management  llc  is conducted 
following our initial public offering and reorganization on october   we became the sole managing member of pzena investment management  llc 
as such  we now control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and other investors collective membership interest in our operating company  we reflect their ownership as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  subsequent to october   our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company s net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of our business 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from management fees and incentive fees  which we collectively refer to as our advisory fees  by managing assets on behalf of institutional accounts and for retail clients  which are generally open end mutual funds catering primarily to retail clients 
our advisory fee income is recognized over the period in which investment management services are provided 
following the preferred method identified in the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  described in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report  income from incentive fees is recorded at the conclusion of the contractual performance period  when all contingencies are resolved 
our advisory fees are primarily driven by the level of our aum 
our aum increases or decreases with the net inflows or outflows of funds into our various investment strategies and with the investment performance thereof 
in order to increase our aum and expand our business  we must develop and market investment strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients and provide attractive returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our aum  and our ability to continue to attract clients  will depend on a variety of factors including  among other things our ability to educate our target clients about our classic value investment strategies and provide them with exceptional client service  the relative investment performance of our investment strategies  as compared to competing products and market indices  competitive conditions in the investment management and broader financial services sectors  general economic conditions  investor sentiment and confidence  and our decision to close strategies when we deem it to be in the best interests of our clients 
for our institutional accounts  we are paid fees according to a schedule  which varies by investment strategy 
the substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these clients pay us fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed upon benchmarks  which results in a slightly lower base fee  but allows us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed upon benchmark 
pursuant to our sub investment advisory agreements with our retail clients  we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the aum declines as the amount of aum increases 
certain of these funds pay us fixed rate management fees 
due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts  the average advisory fees we earn on them  as a percentage of aum  are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our institutional accounts 
the majority of advisory fees we earn on institutional accounts are based on the value of aum at a specific date on a quarterly basis  either in arrears or advance 
generally  advisory fees on certain of our institutional accounts  and with respect to most of our retail accounts  are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value 
advisory fees are also adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio  where the cash flow represents greater than of the value of the portfolio 
while a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate  the method used to calculate the fee according to the fee rate schedule may differ as described above 
our advisory fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following changes in aum due to appreciation or depreciation of our investment portfolios  and the levels of the contribution and withdrawal of assets by new and existing clients  distribution of aum among our investment strategies  which have different fee schedules  distribution of aum between institutional accounts and retail accounts  for which we generally earn lower overall advisory fees  and the level of our performance with respect to accounts on which we are paid incentive fees 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expenses  as well as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  bonuses  awards of equity to our employees and members of our operating company  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  and expenses  such as rent  professional service fees and data related costs  incurred  as necessary  to run our business 
compensation and benefits expense our largest expense is compensation and benefits  which includes the salaries  bonuses  equity based compensation  and related benefits and payroll costs attributable to our members and employees 
compensation and benefits packages are benchmarked against relevant industry and geographic peer groups in order to attract and retain qualified personnel 
since  we have experienced a general decrease in cash compensation and benefits expense  as we reduced our year end bonus packages to reflect the adverse economic conditions in our business and industry in general 
cash compensation has also declined since due to lower revenue based variable compensation costs and a decline in average headcount 
the table included in the section below describes the components of our compensation expense for the three years ended december  for the year ended december  in thousands cash compensation and other benefits distributions on compensatory units change in redemption value of compensatory units acceleration of vesting of compensatory units other non cash compensation total compensation and benefits expense historically  we granted interests in our operating company to selected employees which entitled the holder to a share of the future distributions of our operating company 
pursuant to the then terms of the operating agreement of our operating company  the holders of these interests had the right to require us to redeem their interests upon their termination of employment  or death 
prior to march   we accounted for the distributions on these interests  as well as the annual increase in their redemption value  as compensation expense 
our operating company s operating agreement was amended as of march  to eliminate its obligation to redeem these interests units under any circumstance 
as all of its membership units thereafter had only equity characteristics  neither distributions nor subsequent incremental changes to their value were charged against income from the date of the amendment 
as of march   we accelerated the vesting of all compensatory units as described in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report then subject to vesting 
the one time charge associated with this acceleration  approximately million  was recorded on march  subsequent to this date  distributions on these units have been recorded as a direct reduction of operating company capital 
on january   we adopted the pim llc equity incentive plan  pursuant to which we have issued restricted units  and options to acquire units  in our operating company 
we used a fair value method in recording the compensation expense associated with the granting of these restricted units  and options to acquire units  to new and existing members under the pim llc equity incentive plan 
under this method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the award s vesting period 
the fair value of the units is determined by reference to the market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant  since these units are exchangeable for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the fair value of the options to acquire units is determined by using an appropriate option pricing model on the grant date 
pursuant to the operating company s bonus plan  which became effective january   eligible employees whose cash compensation is in excess of certain thresholds have a portion of that excess mandatorily deferred 
these deferred amounts may be invested  at the employee s discretion  in certain of our investment strategies  restricted phantom units of our operating company  or money market funds 
amounts deferred in any calendar year reduce that year s cash compensation expense and vest ratably over a four year period beginning on january st of the next year 
therefore  the amortization of deferred amounts has been reflected in our expenses beginning january  for the years ended december    and  approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in such compensation was deferred 
at december  and  the liability associated with deferred compensation investment accounts was approximately million and million  respectively  and has been included as a component of other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized approximately million and million  respectively  in compensation and benefits expense associated with the amortization of all deferred compensation awards 
should additional amounts be deferred in future years  we would expect the non cash portion of our compensation expense to increase as the existing and subsequently deferred amounts are amortized through income 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrecorded compensation expense related to unvested operating company phantom units issued pursuant to our deferred compensation plan  operating company unit and option grants issued under our pim llc equity incentive plan  and stock and option grants issued under our pim inc equity incentive plan 
we expect that the amortization of these amounts will be approximately million for  million for  and million per year in and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include office expenses  professional and outside services fees  depreciation  and the costs associated with operating and maintaining our research  trading  and portfolio accounting systems 
our occupancy related costs and professional services expenses  in particular  generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the overall size and scale of our business operations 
as a result of our offering on october   we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  additional expenses associated with being a public company for  among other things  director and officer insurance  director fees  sec reporting and compliance including sox compliance  professional fees  transfer agent fees  and other similar expenses 
these additional expenses have and will continue to reduce our net income 
other income expense other income expense is derived primarily from investment income or loss arising from our investments in various private investment vehicles that we employ to incubate new strategies  interest expense on our outstanding debt  mark to market movements on our swap agreement prior to its termination  and interest income generated on our excess cash balances 
other income expense is also affected by changes in our estimates of the liability due to our selling and converting shareholders associated with payments owed to them under the tax receivable agreement which was executed in connection with our reorganization and offering on october  as discussed further below  under tax receivable agreement  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state  and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from the company s acquisitions of operating company units from its selling and converting shareholders 
amounts waived by our selling and converting shareholders reduce this liability 
we expect the interest and investment components of other income expense  in the aggregate  to fluctuate based on market conditions and the performance of our investment strategies 
non controlling interests our operating company has historically consolidated the results of operations of the private investment partnerships over which we exercise a controlling influence 
after our reorganization  we became the sole managing member of our operating company and now control its business and affairs and  therefore  consolidate its financial results with ours 
in light of our employees and outside investors interest in our operating company  we have reflected their membership interests as a non controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  subsequent to october   our income is generated by our economic interest in our operating company s net income 
as of december   the holders of class a common stock through the company and the holders of class b units of the operating company held approximately and  respectively  of the economic interests in the operations of the business 
income tax provision benefit while our operating company has historically not been subject to us federal and certain state income taxes  it has been subject to new york city unincorporated business tax 
as a result of our reorganization  we are now subject to taxes applicable to c corporations 
as such  our effective tax rate has increased as a result of our reorganization 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
as of december  and  the company s valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company units in conjunction with the offering and subsequent grants was million and a million  respectively 
interest on mandatorily redeemable units until the amendment of its operating agreement on march   the operating company recorded a net liability for its units issued to founders and those purchased by certain employees equal to the accumulated redemption value as of the balance sheet date of all such outstanding units 
this liability also included any undistributed earnings attributable to such units 
as such  interest on mandatorily redeemable units included distributions made on these outstanding units  as well as the incremental increases or decreases in their redemption values 
distributions were generally paid on the operating company s income before non cash compensation charges 
redemption values were determined based on fair value 
prior to march   these units were required to be redeemed upon a member s termination or death 
effective march   the operating company s operating agreement was amended to eliminate its obligation to redeem units under any circumstance 
since all units thereafter had only equity characteristics  neither distributions  nor subsequent incremental changes to these units value  were charged against income subsequent to the effective date of the amendment 
the million charge recorded in represents the distributions and incremental changes to these units fair value through march  operating results general our earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent upon prevailing financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly the equities markets  can have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
beginning in the second half of and continuing through the first quarter of  the performance of our investment strategies was negatively impacted by significant volatility in the equity markets 
investment performance during was influenced by our overweight exposure to the financial services sector in particular  which underperformed the market 
as a result  our assets under management declined by billion  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  beginning in the second quarter of  the performance of our investment strategies improved alongside the significant improvement in the equity markets 
as a result  our aum increased billion  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  for the year ended december   we experienced gross inflows of billion  which were offset by gross outflows of billion 
our institutional accounts experienced gross inflows of billion  which were partially offset by billion in gross outflows 
the institutional gross inflows were mainly attributable to the establishment of several new client relationships in our non us diversified value strategies  while the gross outflows were due to our investment strategies medium term underperformance relative to their respective benchmarks and client re balancing in response to the volatile economic environment 
for the year ended december   our retail accounts experienced billion in net outflows  as a result of billion in gross outflows and billion in gross inflows 
the gross outflows in retail accounts were driven by the underperformance and re balancing described above 
for the year ended december   we experienced gross outflows of billion  which were partially offset by gross inflows of billion 
our institutional accounts experienced gross outflows of billion  which were partially offset by billion in gross inflows 
the institutional gross outflows were mainly attributable to the weaker performance of our institutional funds compared to that of their respective benchmarks  while the gross inflows were primarily due to the establishment of new client relationships across a variety of our strategies 
for the year ended december   our retail accounts experienced billion in net outflows  as a result of billion in gross outflows and billion in gross inflows 
our average aum fluctuates based on changes in the market value of accounts advised and managed by us  and on fund flows 
accordingly  given our lower average aum levels  our revenues for the year ended december  have declined from previous years 
a decrease in revenue typically results in lower operating income and net income 
we expect that we will experience pressure on our operating margins in the future if aum were to decline similar to that of and for the year ended december   our operating expenses declined from their comparable and periods  as we identified and implemented cost savings opportunities 
assets under management and flows the change in aum in our institutional accounts and our retail accounts for the years ended december  and is described below year ended december  assets under management in billions institutional accounts beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows market appreciation depreciation end of period assets retail accounts beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows market appreciation depreciation end of period assets total beginning of period assets inflows outflows net flows market appreciation depreciation end of period assets at december   our billion of aum were invested in various value oriented investment strategies representing distinct geographical segments of the us  global  and europe  australasia  and far east eafe markets 
the following table describes the allocation of our aum  as of december  and  among our investment strategies aum at december  in billions us value strategies global value strategies eafe value strategies total year ended december  versus december  at december   the company managed billion in total assets  an increase of billion  or  from billion at december  the year over year increase in aum was due primarily to billion in market appreciation  offset by net outflows of billion 
improving overall economic conditions contributed to the performance related increase in our aum 
our institutional accounts experienced net inflows of billion and our retail accounts experienced net outflows of billion for the year ended december  these net inflows in institutional accounts were driven in part by the establishment of several new client relationships in our non us diversified value strategies 
the net outflows in retail accounts were driven by our investment strategies medium term underperformance relative to their respective benchmarks and client asset re balancing in response to the volatile economic environment 
at december   the company managed billion in institutional accounts and billion in retail accounts  for a total of billion in assets 
for the year ended december   assets in institutional accounts increased by billion  or  from billion at december   due to billion in market appreciation and billion in gross inflows  partially offset by billion in gross outflows 
for the year ended december   assets in retail accounts increased by billion  or  from billion at december   as a result of billion in market appreciation and billion in gross inflows  offset by billion in gross outflows 
at december   institutional accounts represented of our total aum  compared to at december  at december   our eafe value and global value investment strategies accounted for of our aum  compared to at december  year ended december  versus december  at december   the company managed billion in total assets  a decrease of billion  or  from billion at december  the year over year decrease in aum was due primarily to billion in market depreciation  and  to a lesser extent  net outflows of billion 
generally negative economic conditions and our overweight investment exposure to the financial services sector  in particular  contributed to the performance related decline in our aum 
our institutional and retail accounts experienced net outflows of billion and billion  respectively  for the year ended december  these net outflows were driven in part by our investment strategies underperformance relative to their respective benchmarks and client asset re balancing in response to the volatile economic environment 
at december   the company managed billion in institutional accounts and billion in retail accounts  for a total of billion in assets 
assets in institutional accounts decreased by billion  or  from billion at december   due to billion in market depreciation and billion in gross outflows  partially offset by billion in gross inflows 
during the year ended december   assets in retail funds decreased by billion  or  from billion at december   as a result of billion in market depreciation and billion in gross outflows  partially offset by billion in gross inflows 
at december   institutional accounts represented of our total aum  compared to at december  at december   our eafe value and global value investment strategies accounted for of our aum  compared to at december  revenues our revenue from advisory fees earned on our institutional accounts and our retail accounts for the three years ended december    and is described below year ended december  revenue in millions institutional accounts retail accounts total year ended december  versus december  our total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this change was driven primarily by a reduction in weighted average aum  which decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion from the year ended december  our weighted average fees were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was due in part to large institutional inflows in our newly launched eafe diversified value and global diversified value strategies 
we typically offer reduced fee rates to initial clients in our new product offerings 
weighted average fees also decreased in part due to an increase in the average size of the company s institutional accounts 
the company s tiered fee schedules typically charge lower rates as account size increases 
weighted average assets in institutional accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion at december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in institutional weighted average fees arose due to institutional inflows in our eafe diversified value and global diversified value strategies and a higher institutional average account size  as discussed above 
weighted average assets in retail accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in weighted average fees in retail accounts was due to the voluntary partial fee waiver on the john hancock classic value fund  partially offset by the timing of asset flows 
for the year ended december   our share of this reduction was million 
our waiver expires in may year ended december  versus december  our total revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this change was driven primarily by a reduction in weighted average aum  which decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion from the year ended december  our weighted average fees were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in weighted average fees was primarily due to a shift in asset mix towards institutional accounts 
weighted average assets in institutional accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion at december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
weighted average assets in retail accounts decreased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   and had weighted average fees of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
expenses our operating expenses are driven primarily by our compensation costs 
the table below describes the components of our compensation expense for the three years ended december    and prior to march   much of the historical variability in our compensation costs had been driven by distributions made on our compensatory units then outstanding  and the incremental increases or decreases in their redemption value subsequent to their grant date 
as of march   these items are no longer reflected in compensation expense 
for the year ended december  in thousands cash compensation and other benefits distributions on compensatory units change in redemption value of compensatory units acceleration of vesting of compensatory units other non cash compensation total compensation and benefits expense year ended december  versus december  total operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in general and administrative expenses as discussed below 
compensation and benefits expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in other non cash compensation associated with annual option awards to our employees  partially offset by an increase of million in cash compensation and other benefits 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was mainly attributable to declines in professional services fees and data systems costs 
year ended december  versus december  total operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the million charge taken in associated with the distributions on  and change in redemption value of  the compensatory units of our operating company  and the one time charge associated with the acceleration  as of march   of the vesting of all such compensatory units then subject to vesting 
as a result of changes to the operating company s operating agreement on march   these charges did not recur in compensation and benefits expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the million in charges described above that were not replicated in compensation and benefits expense also decreased due to a million reduction in cash compensation  as we lowered our headcount and reduced our year end bonus packages to reflect the adverse economic conditions in our business and industry in general 
these decreases were  to a limited extent  offset by a million increase in other non cash compensation associated with annual option awards to our employees 
our employee count decreased from at december   to at december  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was mainly attributable to the incurrence  in  of million in professional and outside services fees associated with our reorganization and initial public offering  and data system enhancements that were not replicated in these decreases were offset modestly by an increase in facility related costs associated with the full year impact of the lease of additional office space that began in other income expense year ended december  versus december  other income expense was income of million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of million of income associated with the positive performance of our investments in our own products and million in interest and dividend income 
this income was partially offset by million in interest charges associated with the operating company s term loan and subordinated note agreements  and million in other expense  primarily consisting of adjustments to the company s liability to its selling and converting shareholders 
other income expense was income of million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of million in income associated with the reduction in the liability to selling shareholders that occurred in conjunction with the tax valuation allowance taken on september  in the year ended december   the company also recognized approximately million in income related to the waiver  by its selling shareholders  of all payments due to them under the tax receivable agreement for the and tax years 
as discussed further below  this liability represents of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we realize as a result of the amortization of the increases in tax basis generated from the company s purchase of operating company units from its selling shareholders 
amounts waived by our selling shareholders reduce this liability 
this income was partially offset by million in losses related to the negative performance of our investments in our own products and million in interest charges associated with the operating company s term loan and subordinated notes agreements 
year ended december  versus december  other income expense was income of million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of million in income associated with the reduction in the liability to selling shareholders that occurred in conjunction with the tax valuation allowance taken on september   as noted above 
other income expense was an expense of million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of million in expenses associated with losses related to the negative performance of our investments in our own products  and million in interest expense  offset by million in interest  dividend and other income 
income tax provision benefit year ended december  versus december  the company recognized a million income tax benefit for the year ended december   and a million provision for the year ended december  the income tax benefit included million of benefit associated with adjustments to the valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax asset related to its tax receivable agreement 
the provision included million in expense associated with the establishment of this valuation allowance in september exclusive of these adjustments  the remaining income tax provision for the year ended december  consisted of million in operating company unincorporated business taxes and million of corporate income taxes 
for the year ended december   the remaining income tax provision consisted of million of operating company unincorporated business taxes and million of corporate income taxes 
the decline in these taxes is attributable primarily to declines in taxable income 
a comparison of the effective tax rate for the year ended december  to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is not meaningful due to the valuation allowance adjustments 
year ended december  versus december  the provision for income taxes increased by million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   due to the establishment  in the third quarter of  of a million valuation allowance assessed against the deferred tax asset recorded as part of our initial public offering 
exclusive of the valuation allowance  the remaining income tax provision for the year ended december  consisted of million of operating company unincorporated business taxes and million of corporate income taxes 
for the year ended december   the income tax provision consisted of million of operating company unincorporated business taxes and million of corporate income taxes 
the decline in unincorporated business taxes is attributable primarily to declines in taxable income 
the increase in corporate income taxes is the result of the full year effect of our liability for c corporation taxation in a comparison of the effective tax rate for the year ended december  to the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is not meaningful due to the valuation allowance 
non controlling interests year ended december  versus december  net income loss attributable to non controlling interests was income of million for the year ended december   and consisted of million associated with our employees and outside investors interest in the income of the operating company  and approximately million associated with our consolidated subsidiaries interest in the income of our consolidated investment partnerships 
for the year ended december   net income loss attributable to non controlling interests was income of million  and consisted of million associated with our employees and outside investors interest in the income of the operating company  offset by the million effect of the absorption  by our consolidated subsidiaries  of their share of the losses of our consolidated investment partnerships 
the change in net income attributable to non controlling interests reflects primarily the decline in our weighted average aum  which had a corresponding negative impact on revenues and income  offset by the positive return on the investments in our consolidated investment partnerships in year ended december  versus december  for the year ended december   net income loss attributable to non controlling interests was income of million  and consisted of million associated with our employees and outside investors interest in the income of the operating company  offset by the million effect of the absorption  by our consolidated subsidiaries  of their share of the losses of our consolidated investment partnerships 
for the year ended december   net income loss attributable to non controlling interests was a loss of million and consisted primarily of our employees and outside investors exclusive interest in the million loss of our operating company prior to the consummation of our reorganization on october   and the million effect of the absorption  by our consolidated subsidiaries  of their share of the losses of our consolidated investment partnerships 
these losses were offset by million associated with our employees and outside investors interest in the income of the operating company 
the change in net income attributable to non controlling interests reflects primarily the losses incurred at the operating company in that were not replicated in this change also reflects  to a lesser extent  the impact to our non controlling interests of the less favorable investment performance of the private investment vehicles we managed during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest on mandatorily redeemable units year ended december  versus december  there were no charges associated with interest on mandatorily redeemable units for the years ended december  and  as further explained below 
year ended december  versus december  there were no charges associated with interest on mandatorily redeemable units for the year ended december  as of march   the operating agreement of our operating company was amended to remove all mandatory redemption provisions related to our membership units 
the removal of these provisions caused our membership units to be classified as equity  and neither distributions  nor subsequent changes to these units value  were charged to income following the amendment 
non gaap net income our results for the years ended december  and included adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement and the associated liability to selling and converting shareholders 
excluding these adjustments  diluted net income and diluted net income per share was million and  respectively  for the year ended december   and million and  respectively  for the year ended december  we believe that these adjustments  and the non gaap measures derived from them  provide information to better analyze the company s operations between periods and over time 
investors should consider these non gaap measures in addition to  and not as a substitute for  financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of the non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures is included below for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share and share amounts gaap net income loss net effect of tax receivable agreement non gaap net income gaap non controlling interest of pzena investment management  llc less assumed corporate income taxes assumed after tax income of pzena investment management  llc non gaap net income of pzena investment management  inc non gaap diluted net income non gaap diluted earnings per share attributable to pzena investment management  inc common stockholders non gaap net income for diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted weighted average shares outstanding liquidity and capital resources historically  the working capital needs of our business have primarily been met through cash generated by our operations 
distributions to members of our operating company and loan amortization payments have been our largest use of cash from financing activities 
investing activities have historically been investments in our own investment strategies and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  inclusive of million in cash held by our consolidated investment partnerships 
advisory fees receivable were million 
we also had approximately million in marketable equity securities  net of approximately million in investments set aside to satisfy our obligations under our deferred compensation program 
we expect to fund the liquidity needs of our business in the next twelve months  and over the long term  primarily through cash generated from operations 
as an investment management firm  our business has been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
our liquidity is highly dependent on the revenue and income from our operations  which is directly related to our levels of aum 
for the year ended december   our weighted average aum and revenues declined by and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  these reductions contributed to a decline in our cash provided by operating activities during the same period 
to the extent that our aum declines in the future  the cash provided by operating activities may be negatively impacted 
in determining the sufficiency of liquidity and capital resources to fund our business  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including  among other things  cash  working capital  investments  long term liabilities  lease commitments  debt obligations  and operating company distributions 
further  we consider compensation  one of our largest expenses  as sufficiently variable such that it can be adjusted to mitigate the decline in revenue we have experienced  and may continue to experience  in the next twelve months 
we continuously evaluate our staffing requirements and compensation levels with reference to our own liquidity position and external peer benchmarking data 
the result of this review directly influences management s recommendations to our board of directors with respect to such staffing and compensation levels 
we anticipate that tax allocations to the members of our operating company  which consisted of of our employees  certain unaffiliated persons  two former employees  and us  will continue to be a material financing activity 
cash distributions to operating company members for partnership tax allocations would decline should the taxable income of the operating company decrease 
as discussed further below  on october   our operating company entered into a third amendment to its three year term loan facility the credit agreement  and issued million in senior subordinated notes the notes to entities established by richard s 
pzena  the company s chief executive officer  for the benefit of certain of his family members  an entity controlled by a company director  and a former employee 
the proceeds of the notes and million of cash reserves were used to reduce the principal amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
the amendment to the credit agreement  among other things  precluded us from paying dividends to shareholders  as did one of the provisions of the notes 
as of december   we had terminated our credit agreement and had million principal amount outstanding under the notes 
on december   the restriction on the payment of dividends in the notes was waived 
although we are comfortable with our current capital structure  in the current economic environment  it is uncertain whether additional or alternative sources of debt or equity financing would be available on acceptable terms  if required 
we do not anticipate meaningful outlays for internal investment or capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we believe that the repayment of our bank term loan  elimination of the dividend beginning in  reductions in headcount  and ability to vary cash compensation levels have provided us with an appropriate degree of flexibility in providing for our liquidity needs 
dividend policy we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of membership interests in our operating company 
as a result  we depend upon distributions from our operating company to pay any dividends that our board of directors may declare to be paid to our class a common stockholders  if any 
when  and if  our board of directors declares any such dividends  we then cause our operating company to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the dividends declared 
as of december   we are no longer contractually prohibited from making dividend payments 
we may not pay dividends to our class a common stockholders in amounts that have been paid to them in the past  or at all  if  among other things  we do not have the cash necessary to pay our intended dividends  or any of our financing facilities  or other agreements  restrict us from doing so 
in the future  our board of directors may  in its discretion and subject to the company s operating results  debt agreements and applicable law  reinstate the dividend at an amount to be determined by it 
to the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends in the future  we may decide not to pay dividends 
by paying cash dividends rather than investing that cash in our future growth  we risk slowing the pace of our growth  or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or unanticipated capital expenditures  should the need arise 
credit agreement and senior subordinated notes on july   our operating company borrowed million pursuant to the credit agreement  the proceeds of which were used to finance a special one time distribution to the members of our operating company as of that date 
concurrently  our operating company also obtained a million revolving credit facility to finance our short term working capital needs 
we refer to the term loan and revolving loan facilities as our credit agreement 
as a result of the first two amendments to the credit agreement  our operating company made required amortization payments of million in june and million in september as a result of the third amendment to the credit agreement  our operating company repaid million of the principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement on october  during the year ended december   the company repaid the remaining million of the principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement and terminated it 
in order to fund the million repayment by our operating company on october   we used million in cash reserves and the proceeds from the issuance  on october   of an aggregate of million principal amount of the notes to i entities established by richard s 
pzena  our company s chief executive officer  for the benefit of certain of his family members  ii an entity controlled by a company director  and iii a former employee of our operating company 
each of these notes is unsecured  has a ten year maturity on october   and bears interest at per annum 
the original provisions of the notes included a restricted payments covenant including dividend payments  a prohibition on incurring indebtedness which is not subordinated to the notes  and events of default based on failure to make payments  bankruptcy  change of control and acceleration of material indebtedness 
in addition  the notes were subordinated to the repayment in full of the loans under the credit agreement 
on december   the company  with the prior approval of the independent members of its board of directors  consented to waivers from each of the holders of the notes  in which they waived the restricted payments section of the notes  which prohibited the payments of cash dividends by the company  and the payment pro rata to all lenders section of the notes  which allowed the company to repay the million of notes held by the entity controlled by a company director and the former employee of our operating company  on december  as of december   we are no longer contractually prohibited from making dividend payments 
tax receivable agreement our purchase of membership units of our operating company concurrently with our initial public offering  and the subsequent and future exchanges by holders of class b units of our operating company for shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the exchange rights provided for in the operating company s operating agreement  has resulted in  and is expected to continue to result in  increases in our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating company at the time of our acquisition and these subsequent and future exchanges  which will increase the tax amortization deductions that otherwise would not have been available to us 
these increases in tax basis and tax depreciation and amortization deductions have reduced  and are expected to continue to reduce  the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the current members of our operating company  the one member of our operating company immediately prior to our initial public offering who sold all of its membership units to us in connection with our initial public offering  and any future holders of class b units  that requires us to pay them of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by us  or a change in control  as described in the tax receivable agreement as a result of the increases in tax basis described above and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement  including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement 
in october  the selling unitholders agreed to waive any payments that we were required to make to them for the and tax years pursuant to the tax receivable agreement 
cash flows operating activities provided million and million in cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year decline in cash flows from operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in weighted average aum from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december   which had a corresponding negative impact on total revenues and profits 
operating activities provided million and million in cash flows for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year decline in cash flows from operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in weighted average aum from billion for the year ended december   to billion for the year ended december   which had a corresponding negative impact on total revenues and profits 
this decline was partially offset by the full year impact of the reclassification of cash flows associated with the removal of the previous mandatory redemption provisions of the operating company s operating agreement  noted below 
overall cash compensation declined in  as we reduced our year end compensation packages and lowered headcount by approximately to reduce our overall cost structure 
investing activities consist primarily of investments in affiliates and other investment partnerships  as well as capital expenditures 
investing activities used less than million for each of the years ended december  and investing activities used million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change was largely a result of capital expenditures undertaken in that were not replicated in financing activities consist primarily of borrowing arrangements and contributions from  and distributions to  non controlling interests 
financing activities used million for the year ended december   and used million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a million reduction in distributions to non controlling interests associated with reduced operating company income  partially offset by a million increase in net principal repayments associated with our borrowing agreements 
financing activities used million for the year ended december   and used million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in distributions to non controlling interests associated with reduced operating company income and a suspension of our dividend payments 
this decrease was offset by million in repayments on our debt and the full year effect of the reclassification of cash flows associated with the removal of the previous mandatory redemption provisions of the operating company s operating agreement  noted above 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease for office space senior subordinated notes interest payments on senior subordinated notes total off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial condition 
management believes that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
unit based compensation on january   we adopted the update to the compensation topic of the fasb asc  which requires the recognition of the cost of equity based compensation based on the fair value of the award as of its grant date 
prior to the adoption of the update to the compensation topic of the fasb asc  we accounted for our unit based compensation in accordance with the appropriate us generally accepted accounting principles 
the adoption of the update to the compensation topic of the fasb asc did not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
pursuant to the update to the compensation topic of the fasb asc  we recognize compensation expense associated with the granting of equity based compensation based on the fair value of the award as of its grant date if it is classified as an equity instrument  and on the changes in settlement amount for awards that are classified as liabilities 
prior to march   our compensatory membership unit based awards had repurchase features that required us to classify them as liabilities 
accordingly  distributions paid on these membership units were classified as compensation expense 
in addition  changes to their redemption values subsequent to their grant dates have been included in compensation expense 
as of march   we accelerated the vesting of all compensatory units then subject to vesting 
the one time charge associated with this acceleration  approximately million  was recorded on march  our operating agreement was further amended as of march   such that our operating company will no longer be required to redeem any membership units for cash upon a member s termination or death 
accordingly  beginning with our interim financial statements for the three months ended june   our operating company is no longer required to include in compensation expense the distributions in respect of these membership units  or the change in their redemption value 
consolidation our policy is to consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
we also consolidate non variable interest entities which we control as the general partner or managing member 
we assess our consolidation practices regularly  as circumstances dictate 
all significant inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
investments in private investment partnerships in which we have a minority interest and exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method 
such investments  if any  are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as investments in affiliates and are recorded at the amount of capital reported by the respective private investment partnerships 
such capital accounts reflect the contributions paid to  distributions received from  and the equity earnings of  the private investment partnerships 
the earnings of these private investment partnerships are included in equity in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are a c corporation under the internal revenue code  and thus liable for federal  state and local taxes on the income derived from our economic interest in our operating company 
the operating company is a limited liability company that has elected to be treated as a partnership for tax purposes 
our operating company has not made a provision for federal or state income taxes because it is the responsibility of each of the operating company s members including us to separately report their proportionate share of the operating company s taxable income or loss 
similarly  the income of our consolidated investment partnerships is not subject to income taxes  as such income is allocated to each partnership s individual partners 
the operating company has made a provision for new york city unincorporated business tax ubt 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
determining the valuation allowance requires significant management judgments and assumptions 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
each quarter  we re evaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future profitability 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to the million valuation allowance  recorded against the deferred tax asset associated with our acquisition of operating company membership units  is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes  or variances in future projected operating performance  could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  evaluating our tax positions and establishing deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to earnings would result

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment adviser for the institutional separate accounts we manage and the retail clients for which we act as sub investment adviser 
as noted in item a  risk factors  global markets have continued to experience unprecedented volatility  and a challenging business climate is forecast for the foreseeable future 
market conditions have resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management  which directly impacts our revenues and net income 
a continued economic downturn  and volatility in the global financial markets  could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
all of our revenue for the three years ended december  was derived from advisory fees  which are typically based on the market value of our aum  which can be affected by adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange and equity prices 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities would cause our revenue and income to decline  due to a decrease in the value of the assets we manage 
in addition  such a decline could cause our clients to withdraw their funds in favor of investments offering higher returns or lower risk  which would cause our revenue and income to decline further 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the value of the holdings of our consolidated subsidiaries  which consist primarily of marketable securities 
at december   the fair value of these assets was million 
assuming a increase or decrease  the fair value would increase or decrease by million at december  interest rate risk during the year ended december   the company terminated its credit agreement 
since the interest on the company s remaining million of senior subordinated notes is at a fixed rate  the company does not have any exposure to interest rate risk at december
