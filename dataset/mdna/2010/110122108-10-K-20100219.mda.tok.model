net sales were million in 
table of contents biopharmaceutical segment results the increase in biopharmaceutical segment results is attributed to increased net sales of various key products noted above 
more favorable gross margin percentage attributed to favorable foreign exchange  higher average selling prices  a more favorable product mix and realized efficiencies from pti 
more efficient and reduced spending within marketing  selling and administrative 
partially offset by increased investments within our research and development pipeline 
net earnings from continuing operations attributable to bristol myers squibb company the increase is attributed to improved segment results 
partially offset by unfavorable impact of specified items in the prior year includes a gain on sale of imclone systems incorporated imclone shares

business environment we conduct our business primarily within the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry  which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations 
many competitive factors may significantly affect sales of our products  including product efficacy  safety  price and cost effectiveness  marketing effectiveness  product labeling  quality control and quality assurance of our manufacturing operations  and research and development of new products 
to successfully compete for business in the healthcare industry  we must demonstrate that our products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages 
currently  most of our new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category  in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future 
we manufacture branded products  which are priced higher than generic products 
generic competition is one of our leading challenges globally 
in the pharmaceutical biotechnology industry  the majority of an innovative product s commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity 
when a product loses exclusivity  it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands 
upon exclusivity loss  we can lose a major portion of that product s sales in a short period of time 
currently  generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under us law 

table of contents however  the law could change in the future 
even in the absence of new legislation  the us food and drug administration fda is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics 
competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing  which involve more complex processes which are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
both in the us and internationally  the healthcare industry is subject to various government imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on our net sales 
in the us  congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could result in major changes in the current healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
driven in part by budget concerns  medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others 
in addition  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the us this legislation has had a modest favorable impact on us as a result of an increase in the number of seniors with drug coverage 
at the same time  there continues to be a potential negative impact on the us biopharmaceuticals business that could result from pricing pressures or controls 
in many markets outside the us  we operate in environments of government mandated  cost containment programs  or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing 
pricing freedom is limited in the uk  for instance  by the operation of a profit control plan and in germany by the operation of a reference price system 
companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some countries 
the growth of managed care organizations mcos in the us has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the healthcare industry 
mcos seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers 
because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants  marketing prescription drugs to mcos has become an important part of our strategy 
companies compete for inclusion in mco formularies and we generally have been successful in having our major products included 
we believe that developments in the managed care industry  including continued consolidation  have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices 
pharmaceutical biotechnology production processes are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product 
shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals 
biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
as biologics become a larger percentage of our product portfolio  we will continue to make arrangements with third party manufacturers and to make substantial investments to increase our internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale 
one such investment is a new  state of the art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in devens  massachusetts  the construction of which was substantially completed in we expect to submit the site for regulatory approval in we have maintained a competitive position in the market and strive to uphold this position  which is dependent on our success in discovering  developing and delivering innovative  cost effective products to help patients prevail over serious diseases 
we are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits  claims  proceedings and investigations 
it is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the final outcomes of these investigations or litigations
