overview we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auction style sales technology  which we refer to as vb sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions  charities  car dealerships  fleet operators  vehicle rental companies and the general public 
we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters  however at certain locations  we sell directly to the general public 
the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs 
in the united states and canada  or north america  we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
in the united kingdom  or uk  a significant portion of our business is conducted on a principal basis  purchasing salvage vehicles outright from insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account 
our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue  purchased vehicle revenues  and other remarketing services 
revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or  under our percentage incentive program  or pip program  where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price 
under the consignment  or fixed fee  program  we generally 
table of contents charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation 
although sometimes included in the consignment fee  we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility  storage of the vehicle  and other incidental costs 
under the consignment programs  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue  not the actual sales price gross proceeds 
sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage  loading and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk 
operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  equipment maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management  accounting  data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees  research and development and marketing expenses 
during fiscal and fiscal  we converted all of our north american and uk sales  respectively  to an internet based auction style model using our vb internet sales technology which employs a two step bidding process 
the first step  called the preliminary bid  allows members to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins 
the second step allows members to bid against each other  and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process  in a real time process over the internet 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired fourteen facilities and established twelve new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america and the uk as of july  and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 

table of contents the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august  through july  locations acquisition or greenfield date geographic service area peterlee  england acquisition august northern england wisbech  england acquisition august eastern england rochford  england acquisition august southeast england london  canada greenfield september southern ontario windsor  new jersey greenfield november central new jersey walton  kentucky greenfield january northern kentucky birmingham  alabama greenfield february central alabama inverkeithing  scotland acquisition march central scotland whitburn  scotland acquisition march central scotland featherstone  england acquisition march northeast england doncaster  england acquisition march northeast england minneapolis  minnesota greenfield march central minnesota and wisconsin sikeston  missouri acquisition march southeast missouri york  england acquisition april northern england prairie grove  arkansas greenfield july northwest arkansas louisville  kentucky greenfield september northwest kentucky and southern indiana richmond  virginia greenfield october central virginia montgomery  alabama greenfield february central alabama greer  south carolina greenfield february northwest south carolina warren  massachusetts greenfield june central massachusetts bristol  england acquisition january united kingdom bedford  england acquisition january united kingdom colchester  england acquisition january united kingdom gainsborough  england acquisition january united kingdom luton  england acquisition january united kingdom scranton  pennsylvania greenfield february pennsylvania closed in fiscal former mag facility closed in fiscal in january  the company completed the acquisition of d hales limited d hales which operated five locations in the united kingdom 
this acquisition was undertaken because of its strategic fit with our business in the united kingdom 
in april  we completed the acquisition of simpson bros 
york holdings limited  a uk limited liability company simpson  which operated one location in york  england 
simpson s primary business activity was the dismantling of automobiles and the sales of salvaged auto parts 
in the same month  we also completed the acquisition of bob lowe salvage pool  inc  which operated one location in sikeston  missouri 
in february  we completed the purchase of the assets and business of ag watson auto salvage motors spares scotland limited ag watson  which operated two salvage locations in scotland and two salvage locations in northern england 
in august  we completed the acquisition of century salvage sales limited century  a vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilities located in the uk 
the total consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired 
on june   we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc  universal  for per share approximately based on currency exchange rates on june  
universal  based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk  is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries 
the aggregate acquisition consideration 
table of contents paid by us totaled approximately million approximately million based on currency exchange rates on june  and was funded from our available cash resources 
we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately million million as of june  
the acquisition was our first acquisition outside north america 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions  new openings  weather and product introductions during such periods 
in particular  we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
it is our intention  where possible  to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods 
changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 
in addition to growth through acquisitions  we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and members  and iv expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income presented in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue service revenues vehicle sales service revenues 
service revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the increase in service revenue was due primarily to an increase in the average revenue per car sold 
the increase in the revenue per car sold was driven by increased selling prices as over of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle at the auction 
we believe the increase in the average selling price was primarily due to i an increase in commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  and ii the general increase in used car pricing  which has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles that are either repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user 
we cannot determine the movement of these influences nor can we determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap  dismantling  retailing  or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing and used car pricing had on the selling price of vehicles 
unit volume grew by over one percent resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
the average dollar to pound exchange rate was dollars to the pound and dollars to the pound for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and led to a reduction in service revenue of million 

table of contents vehicle sales 
we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
vehicle sales revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the rise in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of million 
the rise in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies  which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  ii the general increase in used car pricing  which has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles that are either repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user  and iii in the uk  the continuing beneficial impact of vb which we introduced to the uk in and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide 
we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap  dismantling  retailing  or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing and used car pricing  nor can we isolate the impact that vb had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk 
the change in volume reflects the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of million 
the negative impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was million 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or  below fiscal the decline was driven primarily by operational efficiencies and by reductions in subhauling costs relative to the first two quarters of fiscal when the cost of diesel fuel peaked 
included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
cost of vehicle sales 
the cost of vehicles sold was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or 
unit volume decline led to a reduction of million and was primarily due to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis 
cost per unit sold was up and represented a million increase relative to last year 
the negative impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or 
the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions  including nascar and nhra sponsorships  to generate new member activity  ii the additional costs associated with the chairman and chief executive officer s non cash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april and iii increased headcount 
these changes increased general and administrative expenses by million  million  and million  respectively 
also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
other income expense 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or 
net interest income declined million due primarily to reduced interest yields 
other income  net  declined million primarily due a decline in rental income of million and the loss of million on the sale of an airplane in the current year and was offset by a million impairment of a note receivable  relating to the disposal of the assets of a discontinued business  and a million loss on the sale of an airplane in the prior year 

table of contents income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
the decrease was driven primarily by the reduction of state income taxes and the favorable tax treatment we received relating to certain interest expenses in the uk 
net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on customer revenue by class in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue service revenues vehicle sales service revenues 
service revenues were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of million  or  below fiscal the decline in service revenue was due to the negative impact on recorded service revenues due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate and was offset by growth in unit volume and a marginal growth in revenue per transaction 
the average dollar to pound exchange rate was dollars to the pound and dollars to the pound for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and led to a reduction in service revenue of million 
growth in unit volume was driven primarily by an increase in the units sold on behalf of insurance companies and units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships 
the growth resulted from market wins and  with respect to insurance company cars  from what we believe to be an increase in salvage frequency 
salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that are deemed total economic losses by the insurance company 
we believe the increased availability of such cars was as a result of lower average used car pricing 
the growth in unit volume generated million in additional revenue relative to last year 
revenue yield per transaction was marginally higher as the decline in the average selling price was offset by higher yield on services provided and generated million in additional revenue compared to last year 
over of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicles 
we believe the decline in the average selling price was primarily due to i the recent declines in commodity and used car pricing as we believe that commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies  has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  ii the decline in used car pricing because we believe used car pricing has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold to rebuilders and retailers  and iii the strengthening of the dollar as we believe a stronger dollar increases the purchase price of us vehicles paid for in our international buyers local currencies 
however  we do not have sufficient information to determine which vehicles are sold for scrap  dismantling  retailing or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the impact that commodity pricing  used car pricing and foreign currency exchange rates had on the selling price of vehicles

yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses were approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or  below fiscal the beneficial impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was million and was offset by an increase in the cost to process each car which was driven primarily by an increase in subhauling costs in the us and the additional costs associated with five new facilities 
included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
cost of vehicle sales 
the cost of vehicles sold was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or 
the beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the gbp to usd exchange rate was million 
unit volume decline was responsible for million of the total decline and was due primarily to the migration of certain contracts in the uk from a principal basis to a fee basis 
cost per unit sold was up marginally and represented a million increase relative to last year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or 
the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in gbp to usd exchange rate was approximately million 
the growth in general and administrative costs was due primarily to i increased it payroll and technology costs as we expanded our development and network departments  ii increased advertising costs as we invested in events and media promotions to generate public awareness  and iii the additional costs associated with the ceo and president s non cash compensation package approved by the shareholders in april also included in general and administrative expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the years ended july  and  respectively 
other income expense 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decline of approximately million  or 
net interest income declined million due to reductions in both the average cash balances and the interest yield 
other income  net  declined million primarily due to the impairment of a note receivable relating to the sale of assets of the public auction business which we exited in and the loss on the sale of an airplane in the uk  together totaling million  currency exchange losses on certain intercompany obligations and losses on the disposition of other certain assets 

table of contents income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
the increase was driven primarily by the decline in tax exempt interest income 
discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we received a million payment for a note receivable resulting from the sale of certain mag business assets and real estate 
we exited the mag business in our fiscal year 
the gain on the sale of the real estate was deferred until payment on the note receivable was received 
the million of income from discontinued operations represents that gain  net of taxes 
net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of working capital is cash generated though operations 
potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity 
however  with respect to the issuance of equity or debt  we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and  if available  if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 
historically  we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection on sellers fees  members fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles 
our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and  consequently  the number of cars totaled by the insurance companies 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
our primary source of working capital is net income 
accordingly  factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital 
those primary factors i seasonality  ii market wins and losses  iii supplier mix  iv accident frequency  v salvage frequency  vi change in market share of our existing suppliers  vii commodity pricing  viii used car pricing  ix foreign currency exchanges rates  x product mix  and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate  are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections in this form k 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  and cash equivalents of approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of us treasury bills and funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million from fiscal to fiscal we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase was driven primarily by a reduction in income taxes receivable of million which was offset by a decrease in net income of million 
the remaining increase of million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the increase in net income which was offset in part by the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal investing activities during the fiscal year ended july   we purchased approximately million of short term investments  which was offset by the sale of million of short term investments 
we historically invested our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa 
by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  we converted our entire balance of short term investments to cash and cash equivalents 
capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities  opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment 
we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations 
we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july  during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisition of d hales 
we made no acquisitions during the fiscal year ended july  during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisitions of century  simpson  ag watson  and bob lowe s salvage pool 
financing activities in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the exercise of stock options

in february  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
in october  our board of directors approved a million share increase in our stock repurchase program bringing the total current number of shares authorized for repurchase to million shares 
the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program 
subject to applicable securities laws  such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time 
for the year ended july   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a price of

adair  chief executive officer and then president  exercised stock options through cashless exercises 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  mr 
johnson  chairman of the board  exercised stock options through a cashless exercise 
a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price and federal and state minimum statutory tax withholding requirements 
we remitted approximately million to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees minimum statutory withholding requirements 
in fiscal year no stock options were exercised through the cashless exercise method

contractual obligations we lease certain domestic and foreign facilities  and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented  the leases generally require the company to pay property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other operating leases capital leases tax liabilities total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years other letters of credit contractual obligations consist of future non cancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases  used in the normal course of business 
tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
commercial commitments consist primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 

table of contents credit facilities on march   we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit agreement providing for a million revolving credit facility the credit facility 
currently available under the credit agreement is million  subject to a million foreign currency borrowing sublimit and a million letter of credit sublimit 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be used for repurchases of stock  capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility matures and all outstanding borrowings are due on the fifth anniversary of the credit agreement the maturity date  with annual reductions in availability of million on each of the first three anniversaries of the credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be repaid and re borrowed until the maturity date and bear interest  at our option  at either eurocurrency rate plus to  depending on the leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  at the end of the previous quarter or at the us prime rate 
a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the commitment fee ranges from to depending on the leverage ratio as of the end on the previous quarter 
the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and places certain business operating restrictions on us relating to  among other things  indebtedness  liens and other encumbrances  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  and dividends  distributions and redemptions of capital stock 
in addition  the credit agreement provides for a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the credit facility contains events of default that include  among others  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross defaults to certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency defaults  material judgments  invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains restrictions with respect to investments  mergers and acquisitions  dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock  these restrictions become effective only after our debt to ebitda ratio exceeds at july   the debt to ebitda ratio was less than as of july  and july   we did not have an outstanding balance under the credit facility

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  self insured reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  revenue recognition  share based compensation  long lived asset impairment calculations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our 
table of contents significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
where appropriate  we discuss sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 
revenue recognition we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer 
these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery  loading  title processing  preparation and storage 
we evaluate multiple element arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements  which addresses accounting for multiple element arrangements and revenue recognition for units of accounting 
the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller s behalf and  under most of our current north american contracts  collecting the proceeds from the member 
we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the member for the seller and  accordingly  we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection  net of applicable rebates or allowances 
vehicle sales  where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf  are recognized in accordance with asc on the sale date  which is typically the point of high bid acceptance 
upon high bid acceptance  a legal binding contract is formed with the member  and we record the gross sales price as revenue 
in certain cases  seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the member 
however  we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items 
as a result  we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered  which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the member for the seller 
we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle  charging a separate fee for each service 
each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of asc to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi element arrangement 
we have concluded that the sale and the post sale services are separate units of accounting 
the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale  and the fees for the post sale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 
we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  and relist and late payment fees  which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member 
no provision for returns has been established  as all sales are final with no right of return  although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non performance by our members or sellers 
vehicle pooling costs we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us  but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs 
table of contents are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 
we apply the provisions of fasb asc  inventory subsequent measurement  to our vehicle pooling costs 
asc requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as provided in asc in addition  asc requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance  ie total write offs total accounts receivable write off percentage 
we note that a one percentage point deviation in the write off percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of less than million 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our north america and uk operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us  canada and uk 
in arriving at a provision of income taxes  we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  such as various accruals  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet  we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
as of july   we had approximately million of valuation allowance arising from the net operating losses in states where we had discontinued certain operations in prior years and the potential losses if certain capital assets are sold in the uk 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated income statement 
historically  our income taxes have been sufficiently provided to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
nonetheless  our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors  including i the geographical allocation of our 
table of contents future earnings  ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles  iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations 
as a result  we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 
based on our results for the twelve months ended july   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million 
effective august   we adopted fasb asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position  could require the use of cash 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service and us states 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
long lived asset valuation  including intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires that the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions  measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  be recognized in the financial statements 
determining the fair value of options using the black scholes model  or other currently accepted option valuation models  requires highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents retained insurance liabilities we are partially self insured for certain losses related to medical  general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our insurance policies are subject to a  deductible per claim  with the exception of our medical policy which is  per claim 
in addition  each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue 
our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be impacted 
the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances 
the total amount reserved for all policies is approximately million as of july  if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by we estimate that our medical expense would change by approximately million and our medical accrual would change by approximately  if our total payroll changed by we estimate that our workers compensation expense would change by approximately  and our accrual for workers compensation expenses would change by  a change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than segment reporting our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments  which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 
recently issued accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and translation risk 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets  as of july   all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits  us treasury bills  and money market funds 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable  a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
as of july   we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgaged backed securities 
based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july   a change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results 
we do not hedge interest rate fluctuation risks 

table of contents foreign currency and translation exposure fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian and uk operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency  the canadian dollar and the british pound 
our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and british pound in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to revenue of approximately million for the twelve months ended july  there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
fluctuations in the foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period 
at july   the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of approximately million 
this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar or the british pound will not have a material affect on our consolidated financial position 
we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
