item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this report and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain forward looking statements  which generally include the plans and objectives of management for future operations  including plans and objectives relating to our future economic performance and our current beliefs regarding revenues we might generate and profits we might earn if we are successful in implementing our business and growth strategies 
the forward looking statements and associated risks may include  relate to or be qualified by other important factors  including  without limitation our ability to continue as a going concern  our ability to operate our subsidiaries pursuant to the terms and conditions of our dip financing and any cash collateral order entered by the bankruptcy court in connection with the chapter filings  our ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions in the chapter proceedings prosecuted by us from time to time  our ability to develop  prosecute  confirm and consummate one or more plans of reorganization with respect to the chapter filings  our ability to obtain and maintain normal terms with vendors and service providers  our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations  fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and its co products  the projected growth or contraction in the ethanol and co product markets in which we operate  our strategies for expanding  maintaining or contracting our presence in these markets  our ability to successfully operate our ethanol production facilities  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations  and our ability to distinguish ourselves from our current and future competitors 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
any of the factors described immediately above or in the risk factors section above could cause our financial results  including our net income or loss or growth in net income or loss to differ materially from prior results  which in turn could  among other things  cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
important developments background since our inception in  we have conducted ethanol marketing operations through our subsidiary kinergy marketing  llc  or kinergy  through which we market and sell ethanol produced by third parties 
in  we began constructing the first of our four wholly owned ethanol production facilities and were continuously engaged in plant construction until our fourth wholly owned facility was completed in we funded and operate our four wholly owned production facilities through a holding company and four other indirect subsidiaries 
in  we completed our madera  california facility and began producing ethanol and its co products at the facility  and also acquired a interest in a fully operational production facility in windsor  colorado 
in  we entered into credit agreements to borrow up to million to fund the construction of  or refinance indebtedness in respect of  up to five ethanol production facilities and provide working capital as each production facility became operational 
later in  the credit facility was reduced to million for up to four ethanol production facilities 
a portion of this indebtedness was used to refinance outstanding indebtedness in respect of our madera facility as well as other facilities under construction 
in  we began production at our columbia facility in boardman  oregon and in  we began production at our magic valley facility in burley  idaho and another facility in stockton  california 
see business production facilities 
our net sales increased significantly from million in to million in as our facilities began production in  and  with all of our facilities producing and selling ethanol in the last quarter of during these periods  we also sold additional volume under our ethanol marketing arrangements with third party suppliers 
however  our net sales dropped considerably to million in as we idled production at three of our four wholly owned production facilities for most of  as discussed further below 
our average ethanol sales price peaked at per gallon in  stayed relatively stable for and  but declined to per gallon in in  our average price of corn  the primary raw material for our ethanol production  began increasing dramatically  ultimately rising by over from per bushel in to per bushel in as a result  our gross margins  which peaked at in  began declining in  reaching negative in our average price of corn declined to per bushel in  but lower ethanol prices and overhead and depreciation expenses with no corresponding sales from our idled facilities resulted in a gross margin of negative in from until the fourth quarter of when our fourth wholly owned production facility was completed  we endured a cost structure commensurate with our construction activities  including substantial project overhead and staffing 
upon completion of our fourth wholly owned production facility  we sought to alter our cost structure to one more suitable for an operating company 
however  beginning in  we began experiencing significant financial constraints and adverse market conditions  and our working capital lines of credit for our production facilities were insufficient given substantially higher corn prices and other input costs in the production process 
in late and early  we idled production at three of our four wholly owned ethanol production facilities due to adverse market conditions and lack of adequate working capital 
our financial constraints and adverse market conditions continued  resulting in an inability to meet our debt service requirements  and in may  the holding company and each of our four plant subsidiaries  who were the obligors in respect of the aggregate million indebtedness described above  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states code  or the bankruptcy code 
in march  the holding company and our four plant subsidiaries filed a plan of reorganization  as discussed further below 
both we and the ethanol industry experienced significant adverse conditions through most of as a result of elevated corn prices  reduced demand for transportation fuel and declining ethanol prices  resulting in prolonged negative operating margins 
in response to these adverse conditions  as well as severe working capital and liquidity constraints  we reduced production significantly and implemented many cost saving initiatives 
market conditions improved in the last quarter of and in response  in january  we resumed operations at our magic valley facility 
however  margins began deteriorating in late february and continued to deteriorate in march if margins do not improve from current levels  we may be forced to curtail our production at one or more of our operating facilities 
we continue to assess market conditions and when appropriate  provided we have adequate available working capital  we plan to resume production at our idled facilities 
chapter filings on may   five of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  collectively referred to as the bankrupt debtors  each commenced a case by filing voluntary petitions for relief under the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware in an effort to restructure their indebtedness 
we refer to these filings as the chapter filings 
the five subsidiaries include a holding company and four other indirect subsidiaries that hold our wholly owned ethanol production facilities 
neither pacific ethanol  inc  referred to as the parent company  nor any of its other direct or indirect subsidiaries  including kinergy and pacific ag 
products  llc  or pap  have filed petitions for relief under the bankruptcy code 
we continue to manage the bankrupt debtors pursuant to asset management agreements and kinergy and pap continue to market and sell their ethanol and feed production under existing marketing agreements 
subsequent to the chapter filings  the bankrupt debtors obtained additional financing in the amount of up to million to fund working capital and general corporate needs  including the administrative costs of the chapter filings 
the term of this additional financing extends through june  but may terminate earlier upon the occurrence of certain events  including an event of default or the consummation of a formal plan of reorganization 
on march   the bankrupt debtors filed a joint plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court  which was structured in cooperation with certain of the bankrupt debtors secured lenders 
the proposed plan contemplates that ownership of the bankrupt debtors would be transferred to a new entity  which would be wholly owned by the bankrupt debtors secured lenders 
under the proposed plan  the bankrupt debtors existing prepetition and postpetition secured indebtedness of approximately million would be restructured to consist of approximately million in three year term loans  million in eight year pik term loans  and a new three year revolving credit facility of up to million to fund working capital requirements the revolver is initially capped at million but may be increased to up to million if more than two of the bankrupt debtors ethanol production facilities cease operations 
we are in continuing discussions with the secured lenders regarding our possible participation in the reorganization contemplated by the proposed plan  including the potential acquisition by us of an ownership interest in the new entity that would own the bankrupt debtors 
under the proposed plan  we would continue to manage and operate the ethanol plants under the terms of an amended and restated asset management agreement and would continue to market all of the ethanol and wet distillers grains produced by the plants under the terms of amended and restated agreements with kinergy and pap 
financial condition our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
at december   on a consolidated basis  we had an aggregate of million in cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities  which includes amounts that were held by the bankrupt debtors and other consolidated entities 
of this amount  approximately million was unrestricted and available to the parent company for its operations and obligations 
operations at two of our four wholly owned ethanol production facilities remain suspended due to market conditions and in an effort to conserve capital 
we have also taken and expect to take additional steps to preserve capital and generate additional cash 
we are in default to lyles united  llc and lyles mechanical co  collectively  lyles  under promissory notes due in march in an aggregate remaining principal amount of approximately million  plus accrued interest and fees 
we have announced agreements designed to satisfy this indebtedness 
these agreements are between a third party and lyles under which lyles may transfer its claims in respect of our indebtedness in million tranches  which claims the third party may then settle in exchange for shares of our common stock 
through the filing of this report  lyles claims in respect of an aggregate of million of our indebtedness have been settled through this process 
however  we may be unable to settle any further claims in respect of this indebtedness unless and until we receive stockholder approval of this arrangement as the nasdaq stock market imposes on its listed companies certain limitations on the number of shares issuable in certain transactions 
in addition  a payable in the amount of million from a judgment arising out of litigation against us in is due on june  we may not have sufficient funds to make this payment 
we have entered into a commitment letter with southern counties oil co  a california corporation  or sc fuels  in respect of a million credit facility to fund our ongoing working capital requirements  including for the repayment of our obligations to lyles 
sc fuels is owned and controlled by frank p 
greinke  who is one of our former directors  the owner of a customer and the trustee of the holder of a majority of our outstanding shares of series b preferred stock 
the commitment letter contemplates a senior secured credit facility with a two year term 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is to accrue and would be payable quarterly in arrears at the per annum rate of libor plus 
upon any default  the credit facility indebtedness would become immediately convertible into a new series of our preferred stock having rights and preferences substantially the same as our series b preferred stock  except that shares of the new series of preferred stock would not have economic anti dilution protection and the conversion price would be of the volume weighted average price of our common stock over the trading day period preceding conversion 
the credit facility is to be secured by our ownership interest in kinergy 
the commitment letter also contemplates other customary terms and conditions 
the consummation of the credit facility is subject to a number of significant contingencies  including satisfactory results of due diligence  the negotiation and preparation of definitive documentation and the repayment of our indebtedness to lyles united prior to or with the first draw under the credit facility or progress satisfactory to sc fuels in the repayment or restructuring of the indebtedness owing to lyles united 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in closing the credit facility 
as a result of these circumstances  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital  debt service and other liquidity needs until either june   if we are unable to timely close the sc fuels credit facility  or through december   if we are able to timely close the sc fuels credit facility and either pay or further defer the million owed to our judgment creditor on june  these expectations concerning our available liquidity until june  or through december  presume that lyles does not pursue any action against us due to our default on an aggregate of million of remaining principal  plus accrued interest and fees  and that we maintain our current levels of borrowing availability under kinergy s line of credit 
although we are actively pursuing a number of alternatives  including seeking a confirmed plan of reorganization with respect to the chapter filings  seeking stockholder approval to continue our debt for equity exchange program in respect of the lyles indebtedness and seeking to raise additional debt or equity financing  or both  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
if we cannot confirm a plan of reorganization with respect to the chapter filings  complete our debt for equity exchange program in respect of the lyles indebtedness  restructure our debt and raise sufficient capital  in each case in a timely manner  we may need to seek further protection under the bankruptcy code  including at the parent company level  which could occur prior to june  in addition  we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation by our creditors  namely  our judgment creditor or lyles  or be forced to substantially restructure or alter our business operations or obligations 
financial performance summary our net sales decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our net loss increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  factors that contributed to our results of operations for include net sales 
the decrease in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o lower sales volumes 
total volume of ethanol sold decreased by to million gallons in from million gallons in the decrease in sales volume is primarily due to both decreased gallons sold from our ethanol production facilities and from our third party marketing arrangements 
in  two new facilities commenced operations  and in  we produced ethanol at only one facility for most of the year  and o lower ethanol prices 
our average sales price of ethanol decreased to per gallon in as compared to per gallon in gross margins 
our gross margins decreased to negative for as compared to a gross margin of negative for the drop in gross margin was a result of lower ethanol prices and higher depreciation expense in  partially offset by a reduction in corn costs 
depreciation on the ethanol facilities was million for as compared to million in our average price of corn decreased by to per bushel in from per bushel in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in as compared to million in primarily as a result of decreases in payroll and benefits  bad debt expense  derivatives commissions  noncash compensation expense and travel expenses  which were partially offset by increases in professional fees 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  however  increased as a percentage of net sales due to our significant sales decline 
impairments 
our impairments increased by million to million in as compared to million in in  we recognized million in asset impairments 
in  we recognized million in impairment of goodwill and million in asset impairment 
the asset impairments in primarily relate to our ethanol production facilities 
the impairment of goodwill related to our annual goodwill review  mostly reflecting a decline in the valuation of our prior purchase of our interest in front range 
the asset impairment in reflects our decision to abandon construction of our imperial valley ethanol production facility due to adverse market conditions 
in  we further impaired our assets related to our imperial valley facility by an additional million  prior to their disposal 
gain from write off of liabilities 
gain from write off of liabilities was million in  with no corresponding gain in this gain was due to a write off of the liabilities related to our imperial valley facility 
other expense 
our other expense increased by million to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to decreased sales of our business energy tax credits  decreased interest income  where were partially offset by decreased mark to market losses  decreased interest expense and decreased finance cost amortization 
sales and margins over the past three years  our sales mix has shifted significantly from sales generated solely as a marketer of ethanol produced by third parties to now include sales generated as a producer of our own ethanol 
our production facility cost structure also changed significantly  beginning in  as our madera and front range facilities were in full production and continuing in as our columbia facility was in full production and our magic valley and stockton facilities commenced operations 
the shift in our sales mix greatly altered our dependency on certain market conditions from that based primarily on the market price of ethanol to that based significantly on the cost of corn  the principal input commodity for our production of ethanol 
accordingly  our profitability is now highly dependent on the market price of ethanol and the cost of corn 
average ethanol sales prices declined in as compared to the average cbot ethanol price decreased by in as compared to the decrease in the prevailing market price of ethanol was primarily due to the decline in crude oil prices that commenced in mid average corn prices also decreased significantly in as compared to specifically  the average cbot corn price decreased by in as compared to the decrease in the prevailing market price of corn was the primary cause of the decrease in our average corn price 
the average cbot corn price decreased to for from for we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and corn 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales and purchase commitments compared to the magnitude of our existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our exposure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we receive a predetermined service fee and we have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
we believe that our gross profit margins will primarily depend on five key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe will be impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including tax incentives  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  the market price of wdg  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at our facilities to our sales of ethanol produced by third parties 
management seeks to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and  when resources are available  implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address the various factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of increasing ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our limited resources to act upon anticipated factors above and or our inability to anticipate these factors or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate those factors or favorable movements in the factors themselves may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
results of operations the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
certain performance metrics that we believe are important indicators of our results of operations include years ended december  percentage variance gallons sold in millions average sales price per gallon corn cost per bushel cbot equivalent co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn average cbot ethanol price per gallon average cbot corn price per bushel we exclude transportation or basis costs in our corn costs to calculate a cbot equivalent in order to more appropriately compare our corn costs to average cbot corn prices 
co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn shows our yield based on sales of wdg generated from ethanol we produced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results as a percentage dollar percentage of net sales for the years ended variance variance years ended december  favorable favorable december  unfavorable unfavorable dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross loss selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairments goodwill impairments loss from operations gain from write off of liabilities nm other expense  net loss before noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity and provision for income taxes reorganization costs nm provision for income taxes net loss net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity net loss attributed to pacific ethanol  inc preferred stock dividends deemed dividend on preferred stock loss available to common stockholders net sales the decrease in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to a significant decrease in the total volume of ethanol sold and lower average sales prices 
total volume of ethanol sold decreased by million gallons  or  to million gallons in as compared to million gallons in this decrease in sales volume is primarily due to idled operations at three of our ethanol production facilities for nearly all of  as well as decreased sales volume from our third party ethanol marketing arrangements 
during  we completed construction of our stockton and magic valley facilities  and all of our four wholly owned facilities were in operation during the last quarter of our average sales price per gallon decreased to in from an average sales price per gallon of in the average cbot ethanol price per gallon decreased to in from an average cbot ethanol price per gallon of in our average sales price per gallon did not decrease as much as the average cbot ethanol price per gallon for due to both the timing of our sales and the proportion of our fixed price contracts during a period of rising ethanol prices 
cost of goods sold and gross loss our gross loss improved to negative million for from negative million for due to lower corn costs 
our gross margin decreased to negative for as compared to negative for the drop in gross margin was a result of lower ethanol prices and higher depreciation expense in  which were partially offset by a reduction in corn costs 
increased costs to manage our production facilities in relation to the volume they produced contributed to the drop in gross margins  particularly as it relates to our three wholly owned facilities which were not producing ethanol for most of but still incurring maintenance costs and depreciation expense 
total depreciation for was million up from million for our depreciation expense was lower because our stockton and magic valley facilities began operations during these factors were partially offset by lower corn costs 
corn is the single largest component of the cost of our ethanol production and our average price of corn decreased by to per bushel in from per bushel in overall  the price of corn has a significant impact on our production costs due to the timing of the corn and the related ethanol pricing from the time we purchase corn to the sale of ethanol 
generally  we fix our corn price upon shipment from the vendor  and in a falling market  our margins are compressed as both corn and ethanol prices continue to fall from transit to processing of the corn 
further  during we experienced unprecedented volatility in the price of corn ranging from the cbot low for the year of to the cbot high for the year of 
these prices moved in such a short period of time that it became difficult to sell the related ethanol production before the prices of both corn and ethanol changed dramatically primarily downward from the time of the corn purchase 
further  due to falling market prices toward the end of  corn and ethanol ending inventories had been purchased and produced  respectively  at prices higher than prevailing spot prices for the commodities at the end of as a result  we recorded additional losses from this market adjustment of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  decreased by million to million for as compared to million for sg a  however  increased as a percentage of net sales due to our significant sales decline 
the decrease in the amount of sg a is primarily due to the following factors payroll and benefits decreased by million due primarily to a reduction in employees  largely near the end of the first quarter of  as we reduced the number of administrative positions as a result of reduced production and related support needs  bad debt expense decreased by million due primarily to a high provision for bad debt in and a significant recovery from a trade receivable during the third quarter of  derivative commissions decreased by million due primarily to a significant amount of trades during and relatively little activity in  noncash compensation expense decreased by million due primarily to a reduction in the value of share grants to our board of directors in travel expenses decreased by million due primarily to the cessation of our construction related activities 
these items were partially offset by professional fees  which increased by million due primarily to increased legal fees and other legal matters associated with the bankrupt debtors bankruptcy proceedings 
costs associated with our chapter filings after the filing date on may  are recorded as reorganization costs 
asset impairments our asset impairments increased by million to million in as compared to million in in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment  we performed an impairment analysis on our long lived assets  including our ethanol production facilities and assets associated with our suspended plant construction project in the imperial valley near calipatria  california  or the imperial project 
based on our probability weighted cash flows for our long lived assets  including the current status of the bankrupt debtors restructuring efforts as they prepared to file a plan of reorganization  we determined that these assets must be assessed for impairment 
these assessments resulted in a noncash impairment charge of million  thereby initially reducing our property and equipment by that amount 
also in accordance with fasb asc  we assessed for impairment our assets associated with our imperial project in and in november  we began proceedings to liquidate these assets and liabilities 
based on our original assessment of the estimated undiscounted cash flows  we recorded an impairment charge of million  thereby initially reducing our property and equipment by that amount 
at the end of the third quarter in  our revised assessment of the estimated undiscounted cash flows resulted in an additional impairment charge of million 
goodwill impairments in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we conducted an impairment test of goodwill as of march  as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  requiring us to write off our entire goodwill balances from our previous acquisitions of kinergy and front range 
gain from write off of liabilities in connection with our imperial project  discussed above  in the fourth quarter of  the assets were sold and the resulting cash proceeds and the settlement of the remaining liabilities were deemed out of our control as they had been assigned to a trustee 
as such  we wrote off the remaining liabilities  resulting in a gain of million for the year ended december  other expense  net other expense increased by million to million in from other expense of million in the increase in other expense is primarily due to the following factors other income decreased by million primarily related to sales  which did not recur in  of our business energy tax credits sold in as pass through investments to interested purchasers  and interest income decreased by million due to lower average cash balances 
these items were partially offset by mark to market losses decreased by million related to our interest rate swaps which we de designated in associated with our bankrupt debtors credit facility  and interest expense decreased by million  as we ceased fully accruing interest on our debt due to the chapter filings 
since may   we only accrue interest on our debt that is probable to be repaid as part of a plan of reorganization  and amortization of deferred financing fees decreased by million  as we wrote off a significant amount of deferred financing fees at the time of the chapter filings 
reorganization costs in accordance with fasb asc  reorganizations  revenues  expenses  realized gains and losses  and provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring of the business must be reported separately as reorganization items in the statements of operations 
we wrote off a portion of our unamortized deferred financing fees on the debt which is considered to be unlikely to be repaid 
during  the bankrupt debtors settled a prepetition accrued liability with a vendor  resulting in a realized gain 
professional fees directly related to the reorganization include fees associated with advisors to the bankrupt debtors  unsecured creditors  secured creditors and administrative costs in complying with reporting rules under the bankruptcy code 
the bankrupt debtors reorganization costs for the year ended december  consist of the following in thousands write off of unamortized deferred financing fees settlement of accrued liability professional fees dip financing fees trustee fees total net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity relates to the consolidated treatment of front range  a variable interest entity  and represents the noncontrolling interest of others in the earnings of front range 
we consolidate the entire income statement of front range for the periods covered 
however  because we only own of front range  we must reduce our net income or increase our net loss for the noncontrolling interest  which is the ownership interest that we do not own 
for  this amount decreased by million from the same period in due to fluctuations in net loss of front range 
preferred stock dividends shares of our series a and b preferred stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in an amount equal to and per annum  respectively  of the purchase price per share of the preferred stock 
for our series a preferred stock  we declared and paid cash dividends of million for during  the former holder of our series a preferred stock converted all of its shares of series a preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
we did not pay any dividends on our series a preferred stock in as there was none outstanding during that period 
for our series b preferred stock  we declared cash dividends of million and million for and  respectively 
we are currently in arrears and have not paid the million of preferred dividends declared in deemed dividend on preferred stock during  we recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of million in connection with a subsequent issuance of shares of series b preferred stock 
this non cash dividend reflects the implied economic value to the preferred stockholder of being able to convert the shares into common stock at a price as adjusted for the value allocated to the warrants which was in excess of the fair value of the series b preferred stock at the time of issuance 
the fair value was calculated using the difference between the conversion price of the series b preferred stock into shares of common stock  adjusted for the value allocated to the warrants  of per share and the fair market value of our common stock of on the date of issuance of the series b preferred stock 
the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item and adjusts our reported net loss  together with the preferred stock dividends discussed above  to loss available to common stockholders 
liquidity and capital resources our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
at december   on a consolidated basis  we had an aggregate of million in cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities  which includes amounts that were held by the bankrupt debtors and other consolidated entities 
of this amount  approximately million was unrestricted and available to the parent company for its operations and obligations 
operations at two of our four wholly owned ethanol production facilities remain suspended due to market conditions and in an effort to conserve capital 
we have also taken and expect to take additional steps to preserve capital and generate additional cash 
we are in default to lyles united  llc and lyles mechanical co  collectively  lyles  under promissory notes due in march in an aggregate remaining principal amount of approximately million  plus accrued interest and fees 
we have announced agreements designed to satisfy this indebtedness 
these agreements are between a third party and lyles under which lyles may transfer its claims in respect of our indebtedness in million tranches  which claims the third party may then settle in exchange for shares of our common stock 
through the filing of this report  lyles claims in respect of an aggregate of million of our indebtedness have been settled through this process 
however  we may be unable to settle any further claims in respect of this indebtedness unless and until we receive stockholder approval of this arrangement as the nasdaq stock market imposes on its listed companies certain limitations on the number of shares issuable in certain transactions 
in addition  a payable in the amount of million from a judgment arising out of litigation against us in is due on june  we may not have sufficient funds to make this payment 
we have entered into a commitment letter with southern counties oil co  a california corporation  or sc fuels  in respect of a million credit facility to fund our ongoing working capital requirements  including for the repayment of our obligations to lyles 
sc fuels is owned and controlled by frank p 
greinke  who is one of our former directors  the owner of a customer and the trustee of the holder of a majority of our outstanding shares of series b preferred stock 
the commitment letter contemplates a senior secured credit facility with a two year term 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is to accrue and would be payable quarterly in arrears at the per annum rate of libor plus 
upon any default  the credit facility indebtedness would become immediately convertible into a new series of our preferred stock having rights and preferences substantially the same as our series b preferred stock  except that shares of the new series of preferred stock would not have economic anti dilution protection and the conversion price would be of the volume weighted average price of our common stock over the trading day period preceding conversion 
the credit facility is to be secured by our ownership interest in kinergy 
the commitment letter also contemplates other customary terms and conditions 
the consummation of the credit facility is subject to a number of significant contingencies  including satisfactory results of due diligence  the negotiation and preparation of definitive documentation and the repayment of our indebtedness to lyles united prior to or with the first draw under the credit facility or progress satisfactory to sc fuels in the repayment or restructuring of the indebtedness owing to lyles united 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in closing the credit facility 
as a result of these circumstances  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital  debt service and other liquidity needs until either june   if we are unable to timely close the sc fuels credit facility  or through december   if we are able to timely close the sc fuels credit facility and either pay or further defer the million owed to our judgment creditor on june  these expectations concerning our available liquidity until june  or through december  presume that lyles does not pursue any action against us due to our default on an aggregate of million of remaining principal  plus accrued interest and fees  and that we maintain our current levels of borrowing availability under kinergy s line of credit 
although we are actively pursuing a number of alternatives  including seeking a confirmed plan of reorganization with respect to the chapter filings  seeking stockholder approval to continue our debt for equity exchange program in respect of the lyles indebtedness and seeking to raise additional debt or equity financing  or both  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
if we cannot confirm a plan of reorganization with respect to the chapter filings  complete our debt for equity exchange program in respect of the lyles indebtedness  restructure our debt and raise sufficient capital  in each case in a timely manner  we may need to seek further protection under the bankruptcy code  including at the parent company level  which could occur prior to june  in addition  we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation by our creditors  namely  our judgment creditor or lyles  or be forced to substantially restructure or alter our business operations or obligations 
quantitative year end liquidity status we believe that the following amounts provide insight into our liquidity and capital resources 
the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report dollars in thousands as of and for the year ended december  variance current assets current liabilities property and equipment  net notes payable  net of current portion liabilities subject to compromise nm cash used in operating activities working capital working capital ratio change in working capital and cash flows working capital decreased to a deficit of million at december  from a deficit of million at december  as a result of a significant decrease in current liabilities of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in current assets of million 
current liabilities decreased significantly primarily due to the chapter filings  which reclassified our prepetition debt to liabilities subject to compromise  which was million at december  current liabilities also decreased due to a decrease in construction related liabilities from our write off of the liabilities of our imperial project 
current assets decreased primarily due to net decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  as we idled operations at three of our facilities for most of at december   our columbia and front range facilities were operating  whereas  at december   most of our facilities were operating at near full capacity

the dip financing matures on june   or sooner if certain covenants are not maintained 
the dip financing allows the dip lenders a first priority lien on a dollar for dollar basis of their term loans and working capital lines of credit funded prior to the chapter filings for each dollar of dip financing 
as the bankrupt debtors draw down on their dip financing  an equivalent amount is reclassified from liabilities subject to compromise to dip financing and rollup  or dip rollup

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
going concern assumption we have based our financial statements on the assumption of our operations continuing as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of the recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our existence 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at our facilities 
as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products  though ultimately titled to us  in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which  depending upon the terms of the transactions  title to the product may technically pass to us  but the risks and rewards of inventory ownership remain with third party suppliers as we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions and therefore act predominantly in an agency capacity 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer and supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the vendor s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related  unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
when we act in an agency capacity  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined agency fees and any associated freight only  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
we have determined that front range meets the definition of a variable interest entity 
we have also determined that we are the primary beneficiary and we are therefore required to treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes rather than use equity investment accounting treatment 
as a result  we have consolidated the financial results of front range  including its entire balance sheet with the balance of the noncontrolling interest displayed as a component of equity  and its income statement after intercompany eliminations with an adjustment for the noncontrolling interest as net income loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity  since the acquisition of our interest in front range on october  as long as we are deemed the primary beneficiary of front range  we must treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets are primarily associated with our ethanol production facilities  reflecting the original cost of construction 
our intangible assets  including goodwill  were derived from the acquisition of our interest in front range in and our acquisition of kinergy in in connection with the share exchange transaction 
in accounting for the share exchange transaction  we allocated the respective purchase prices to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase prices over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded as goodwill 
we evaluate impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of each asset or asset group could be less than the net book value of the asset or asset group 
in such event  we assess long lived assets for impairment by first determining the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows each asset or asset group is expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset or asset group 
if the amount of proceeds is less than the asset or asset group s carrying value  we then determine the fair value of the asset or asset group 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industries in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  including inflation  and purchasing decisions of our customers 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized asset impairment charges associated with our ethanol production facilities and our imperial project in the aggregate amounts of million and million  respectively 
we review our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these assets using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
during the year ended december   we performed our annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets and recognized an impairment loss of million  the entire amount of our goodwill 
allowance for doubtful accounts we primarily sell ethanol to gasoline refining and distribution companies and wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk from sales of our ethanol as of december   as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  those ethanol customers historically have had good credit ratings and historically we have collected amounts that were billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance in question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
for the year ended december   we recognized a recovery of bad debt expense of million and for the year ended december   we recognized a bad debt expense of million 
impact of new accounting pronouncements on june   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended its guidance to fasb accounting standards codification  or asc   consolidations  surrounding a company s analysis to determine whether any of its variable interest entities constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
we will adopt these provisions beginning on january  we are currently evaluating whether this guidance will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
on may   the fasb issued fasb asc  subsequent events  which provides guidance on management s assessment of subsequent events 
historically  management had relied on united states auditing literature for guidance on assessing and disclosing subsequent events 
fasb asc represents the inclusion of guidance on subsequent events in the accounting literature and is directed specifically to management  since management is responsible for preparing an entity s financial statements 
the guidance clarifies that management must evaluate  as of each reporting period  events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date that the financial statements are issued 
the guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual financial periods ending after june  we adopted the provisions of fasb asc for our reporting period ending june  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have evaluated subsequent events up through the date of the filing of this report 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb asc  consolidations  which amended existing guidance that changed our classification and reporting for our noncontrolling interests in our variable interest entity to a component of stockholders equity deficit and other changes to the format of our financial statements 
except for these changes in classification  the adoption of fasb asc did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on january   we adopted certain provisions of fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  which changed the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb asc and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the adoption of these amended provisions resulted in enhanced disclosures and did not have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  which mandates a two step process for evaluating whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to the entity s own stock 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on january   we adopted certain provisions of fasb asc  business combinations  which amended certain of its previous provisions 
these amendments provide additional guidance that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
the guidance requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
in addition  the guidance requires acquisition costs and restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur to be recognized separately from the business combination  therefore  expensed instead of part of the purchase price allocation 
these amended provisions will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
