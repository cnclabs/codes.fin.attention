table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and market technology solutions that enable it services to be securely delivered on demand independent of location  device or network powered by citrix virtual computing infrastructure 
our customers achieve lower it operating costs  increased information security  and greater business agility using citrix technologies that virtualize business meetings  user support  client hardware  desktop operating systems  applications  networks  server hardware and cloud services 
we market and license our products directly to enterprise customers  over the web  and through systems integrators  or sis  in addition to indirectly through value added resellers  or vars  value added distributors  or vads  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
executive summary our solutions can fundamentally change an information technology organization s approach and strategic value  transforming information technology  or it  into an on demand service by centralizing the delivery of applications and desktops 
further  this approach to it transforms data centers  making them far more flexible to adapt to the changing needs of an enterprise 
we believe our approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies in the area of desktop management  including but not limited to desktop virtualization and application virtualization  marketed as our desktop solutions  and server virtualization  application networking and optimization  marketed as our datacenter and cloud solutions  to deliver the most comprehensive end to end application delivery solution  and one that  when considered as a whole  is competitively differentiated by its feature set and interoperability 
the global recession that started in impacted it spending  and we see the uncertainties that remain in today s economic environment continuing to impact it spending  but to a lesser extent than in early we expect that we will continue to see many it projects delayed  scaled back or re evaluated 
the overall uncertainty in the global economy has adversely affected  and may continue to negatively impact  sales of our products and may result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of technologies and increased price competition 
at the same time  however  this environment puts a much sharper focus on it products and services that can reduce cost and deliver quick  tangible return on investment  or roi 
with our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions  we intend to continue highlighting our solutions abilities to reduce it costs  increase business flexibility and deliver roi 
further  we are seeing increased interest in desktop virtualization 
xenapp and xendesktop  for example  can reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop and applications in a customer s datacenter  where they are more easily and efficiently maintained 
xenserver and netscaler can alter the traditional economies of the datacenter by providing much greater levels of flexibility of computing resources  especially with respect to servers  by improving application performance and thereby reducing the amount of processing power involved  and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers for multiple purposes 
our online services product group is focused on developing and marketing web based access  support and collaboration software and services 
these products are primarily marketed via the web to individuals  prosumers and small businesses 
our real time collaboration products from our online services division offer secure and cost effective solutions that allow users to host and actively participate in online meetings  webinars and training sessions remotely and reduce costs associated with business travel 
our web based access solution offers a secure  simple and cost efficient way for users to access their desktops remotely 
further  we will endeavor to sustain the long term growth of our businesses and enhance our current solutions through technological innovation  engineering excellence  selective and strategic acquisition of technology  talent and or companies  and through a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
we expect to continue to make strategic investments in research and development of existing and new products  and we will invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future application 
we believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our desktop solutions and datacenter and cloud solutions is the key to meeting customer and partner needs and achieving our future growth 
from an operations standpoint  in order to operate more efficiently and to drive long term changes in our cost model  on january   we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring program  or the strategic restructuring program 
the strategic restructuring program included reducing our headcount by approximately full time positions 
in  we incurred a pre tax charge of million related to employee severance and related costs and non cancelable lease costs related to the consolidation of certain of our facilities 
in addition to the strategic restructuring program  we took steps in to reduce operating costs that included reprioritizing internal projects  reducing contract workers and limiting travel spending 

table of contents summary of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance product license revenue decreased to million  license updates revenue increased to million  online services revenue increased to million  technical services revenue increased to million  operating income increased to million  and diluted earnings per share increased to 
the decrease in our product license revenue was primarily driven by decreased sales of our application virtualization products  mainly in our emea segment 
as expected  we saw many customers delay or reduce planned it projects in response to macro economic conditions 
however  we are seeing signs of potential improvement  including improving dynamics in certain markets and a high level of interest in desktop virtualization 
we currently expect our product license revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of the increase in license updates revenue was driven by renewals of our subscription advantage product over a larger subscriber base 
our online services revenue increased due to increased sales of our web collaboration services 
we currently expect that total revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of  as well as when comparing the fiscal year to the fiscal year 
the increase in operating income is primarily due to a reduction in compensation and employee related costs of million primarily due to the strategic restructuring program  net of costs related to the strategic restructuring program 
also contributing to the increase in operating income is an increase in gross margin of million primarily due to an increase in total revenues due to factors discussed above 
in addition  the recent crisis in the credit markets caused some of our investments to experience declines in fair value  which resulted in impairment charges and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by holding these investments will have a material adverse effect on our operating cashflows or financial position 
we continue to monitor our overall investment portfolio and if the credit ratings of the issuers of our investments deteriorate or if the issuers experience financial difficulty  including bankruptcy  we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of the securities in our investment portfolio and recognize additional impairment charges for declines in fair value which are determined to be other than temporary 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
acquisition in october  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of vapps  inc  or vapps  a privately held delaware corporation headquartered in hoboken  new jersey 
vapps offers high quality audio conferencing solutions to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise and service provider markets that complement our online services products 
the total consideration for this transaction was approximately million in cash  including million in transaction costs 
in addition  if certain financial and operational milestones are achieved by the vapps business  contingent consideration of up to approximately million may be earned 
the sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash and investments 
in addition  we assumed approximately million unvested stock options upon the closing of the transaction 
in connection with the vapps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill  million to product related technologies and million to other intangible assets 
the goodwill related to the vapps acquisition was allocated to our online services segment and is not deductible for tax purposes 
revenues from vapps are included in our online services revenue 
the vapps results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning after the date of its acquisition and are not significant in relation to our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions during  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies  ardence delaware inc  a leading provider of solutions that allow information technology administrators to set up and configure pcs  servers  and web servers in real time from a centrally managed source  and xensource  inc  a privately held leader in enterprise grade virtual infrastructure solutions  collectively the acquisitions 
the acquisitions positioned us in adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets that will allow us to continue to extend our leadership in the broader application delivery infrastructure market 
the total consideration for the acquisitions was approximately million  comprised of approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million  million in cash and approximately million in direct transaction costs 
in addition  in connection with the acquisitions  we issued approximately million unvested shares of our common stock  million non vested stock units and assumed approximately million stock options each of which will be exercisable for the right to receive one share of our common stock upon vesting 
revenues from the products acquired in the acquisitions are primarily included in our product license revenue 
the acquisitions results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning after the date of each of the acquisitions 
the source of funds for the cash consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments 
in connection with the acquisitions  we allocated million to goodwill  million to product related intangible assets and million to other intangible assets 

table of contents in process research and development for acquisitions the fair values used in determining the purchase price allocation for certain intangible assets for our acquisitions were based on estimated discounted future cash flows  royalty rates and historical data  among other information 
purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  of million and million was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition of vapps and acquisitions  respectively  because it pertained to technology that was not currently technologically feasible  meaning it had not reached the working model stage  did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was determined using the income approach  which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a project s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return  which ranged from 
the rate of return determination included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the ipr d 
in  we adopted new accounting rules for acquisitions and future ipr d will be capitalized 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions continue to decline  or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate  we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
we license most of our products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with enhancements and unspecified upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates  when not bundled with the initial product license 
customers may also elect to purchase maintenance  technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to license updates  maintenance and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe of fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates for subscriptions related to new products 

table of contents in the normal course of business  we are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions  unless the product item is defective in manufacture  but we do provide most of our distributors with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the th day of the fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
product items returned to us under the stock balancing program must be in new  unused and unopened condition 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both  specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  and december  we also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 
for purposes of determining the expected volatility factor  we used the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns 
we also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards that vest based on service  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we issue non vested stock units and non vested stock with performance goals to certain senior members of management 
the number of non vested stock units or non vested stock underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units or non vested stock that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options  non vested stock and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information regarding our adoption of the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation 
valuation and classification of investments effective january   we adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the authoritative guidance  which  among other things  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
our investments are carried at fair value and in determining their fair value we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques 
the authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
the authoritative guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  described as level  and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs  described as level observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources  such as market quoted prices 
when level observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value  we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances 
when valuation techniques  other than those described as level are utilized  management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments 
the degree to which management s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
after we have determined the fair value of our investments  for those that are in an unrealized loss position  we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the amortized cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost  and our intent to sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  which may not be until maturity 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  rating agency actions and changes in credit default swap levels 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements 

table of contents product related technology assets we have acquired our product related technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
in applying purchase accounting  we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
we review acquired product related technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had million in goodwill related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we operate in a single industry segment consisting of the design  development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand 
our revenues are derived from sales of our desktop solutions and related technical services in the americas  emea  and asia pacific regions and from online services sold by our online services division 
these three geographic regions and the online services division constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill among these segments  which represent our reporting units 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb s authoritative guidance which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
there was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of and historically  we completed the annual goodwill impairment test as of december of each fiscal year 
during fiscal  we changed the annual impairment test date from december to october this change was made to allow for more time and better support in the completion of the assessment prior to the filing of our annual report on form k as a large accelerated filer 
in addition  the earlier date would allow us the additional time necessary to complete any step impairment analysis should one be required in the future prior to the filing of our annual report on form k 
we believe the resulting change in accounting principle related to changing the annual impairment testing date will not delay  accelerate  or avoid an impairment charge 
we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances 
a letter of preferability from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding this change in accounting principle is included as an exhibit to this annual report on form k for the year ended december  excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses from acquired companies and unrealized losses from temporary impairments on available for sale investments was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 

table of contents in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in overview and part item a entitled risk factors  which could impact our future performance and financial position

table of contents revenues net revenues include the following categories product licenses  license updates  online services and technical services 
product licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major products our desktop solutions  comprised primarily of our desktop virtualization product xendesktop and our application virtualization product xenapp  our datacenter and cloud solutions  comprised primarily of our server virtualization products  xenserver and essentials for xenserver and hyper v and our application networking products netscaler  access gateway and branch repeater 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our vads and vars to stimulate demand for our products 
revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our vads and vars 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
online services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements from our web collaboration  connectivity and remote support products  gotomeeting  gotowebinar  gototraining  gotoassist and gotomypc which are recognized ratably over the contract term 
technical services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term  as well as revenues from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products  which is recognized as the services are provided

table of contents deferred revenue deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates revenue from our subscription advantage product  online services revenues from annual service agreements for our online services products and technical services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts 
deferred revenues increased approximately million as of december  compared to december  primarily due to new sales of our subscription advantage product of million  increased sales of our support services of million and increased renewals of our subscription advantage product of million 
we currently expect deferred revenue to continue to increase in we do not believe that backlog  as of any particular date  is a reliable indicator of future performance 
while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped 
although the amount of such product license orders may vary  the amount  if any  of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of the same period

operating expenses foreign currency impact on operating expenses a substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak  the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the aggregate gain in our hedging contracts 
when the dollar is strong  the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the aggregate loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
due to the generally weaker dollar during the year ended december  compared to  our operating expenses were higher when converted to us dollars  but these higher expenses were partially offset by gains in our hedging programs

the rar asserts income tax deficiencies related to the transfer pricing and consequential adjustments of approximately million for tax years and  excluding interest 
in addition  the transfer pricing and consequential adjustments to our and tax years would impact our income tax liabilities in tax years subsequent to we disagree with the adjustments and have filed a protest  which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals division of the irs

we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses from acquired companies and unrealized losses from temporary impairments on available for sale investments was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes

available for sale investments as of december   we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately million  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  related to our million face value investment issued by aig matched funding corporation  or the aig capped floater  which matures in september american international group  inc  or aig  as the issuer s parent  provided a guarantee of the security at the time of purchase in september the unrealized loss was primarily caused by aig experiencing liquidity challenges which were reportedly precipitated by problems in the capital markets 
aig s lack of liquidity triggered a downgrade in the credit ratings for its long term issues by two rating agencies in as a result of aig s liquidity challenges  in november the federal reserve bank of new york  or the frbny  intervened with a five year credit facility to help stabilize aig and the overall market 
in addition  on march   aig announced further actions were taken in cooperation with the us department of treasury and the frbny to provide aig with additional financial stability 
as of the date of this report  aig has not been reported to have defaulted on capital repayments to holders of its recently matured debt and it continues to pay us interest on the aig capped floater 
because we do not intend to sell the aig capped floater and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  which may not occur until maturity  we do not consider the security to be other than temporarily impaired 
if aig s financial position deteriorates  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the aig capped floater and potentially recognize an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the investment 
based on our available cash and other investments  we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by holding the aig capped floater to recovery will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
gross realized gains on sales of available for sale investments during were million and gross realized losses on available for sale investments during were million

there was also an other than temporary loss on available for sale investments of approximately million related to an other than temporary impairment of an investment in our portfolio due to the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings 
we continue to monitor our overall investment portfolio and if the credit ratings of the issuers of our investments deteriorate or if the issuers experience financial difficulty  including bankruptcy  we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of the securities in our investment portfolio and recognize additional impairment charges for declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary 
trading investments as of december   we held municipal auction rate securities  of which substantially all were triple a rated  with an aggregate par value of approximately million  whose underlying assets are generally student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program through investment accounts managed by ubs financial services  inc  or ubs 
the market for municipal auction rate securities in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures in and there have been no successful auctions for the securities held in our portfolio since the failures began 
in november  we formally accepted the terms of a settlement from ubs  or the settlement 
upon accepting the terms of the settlement  we received an enforceable  non transferable right  or the put option  that enables us to sell our auction rate securities back to ubs during the period between june  and july  at par value 
accordingly  we recorded the fair value of the put option in other assets in our financial statements and contemporaneously made the fair value election as permitted by the authoritative guidance which states that companies may elect the fair value option for eligible financial assets 
therefore  we record changes in the fair value of the put option in earnings 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million related to our investments in auction rate securities and a corresponding loss of million related to the put option  both of which are included in other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents fair value measurements on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the authoritative guidance  which  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
fair value is defined as an exit price  representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  the guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis we measure our cash flow hedges at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets and we generally measure our investments in available for sale securities at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
due to the illiquidity in the municipal auction rate securities market caused by failed auctions  our valuation technique for certain of our municipal auction rate securities is to measure such securities at fair value using a discounted cash flow model 
in our discounted cash flow model  we used several assumptions to derive a fair value for our investments in municipal auction rate securities  including a discount rate based on the credit quality of the underlying investments and a factor to further discount the investments for the illiquidity currently present in the market for these securities 
accordingly  these trading investments are included in level also included in level is the put option 
in order to determine the fair value of the put option  we measured the differential between the aggregate par value of our auction rate securities and their fair value as of the reporting date and applied a discount rate that considers both the time period between the reporting date and the first date we will be able to exercise our right to put the auction rate securities to ubs per the terms of the settlement and the credit worthiness of ubs 
during  we measured our aig capped floater using indicative pricing for another aig security with similar terms  or the referenced security  which had regular trading activity  a level observation 
during  trading activity in the referenced security significantly decreased and other floating rate aig debt securities with regular trading activity were too close to their maturities to be used to establish a fair value for the aig capped floater 
therefore  in order to measure the aig capped floater at fair value we used a discounted cash flow model 
we then discounted those cash flows at a rate reflecting the market risk inherent in holding an aig security with a similar maturity as evidenced by pricing in the markets 
since utilizing a discounted cash flow model required us to make assumptions that were not directly or indirectly observable regarding the aig capped floater s fair value during  it was transferred to level and is included in the table below as a transfer to level assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level put option long term investments total in thousands balance at december  transfers to level proceeds received on level securities total realized gains losses included in earnings balance at december  realized gains losses included in earnings for the period are reported in other expense income  net

effective september   we entered into an amendment and restatement of the credit facility  or the amendment 
the amendment decreased the overall range of interest we will pay on amounts outstanding on the credit facility and lowered the facility fee 
in addition  the amendment extended the term of the credit facility 
the credit facility  as amended  allows us to increase the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of million 
the credit facility  as amended  currently provides for a revolving line of credit that will expire on september  in the aggregate amount of million  subject to continued covenant compliance 
a portion of the revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of million may be available for issuances of letters of credit and in the aggregate amount of million may be available for swing line loans 
the credit facility  as amended  currently bears interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on the level of our total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
in addition  we are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from to based on the aggregate amount available under the credit facility  as amended  and the level of our total debt and adjusted ebitda

during  capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities  the purchase of our corporate headquarters buildings and leasehold improvements 
we have an operating lease obligation related to a property that is not fully utilized that continues to with a total remaining obligation at december  of approximately million  of which million was accrued as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than we estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  japanese yen  australian dollars  indian rupees  swiss francs  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars  canadian dollars and danish krone 
to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million  resulting in a net asset position 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale and trading securities 
we maintain available for sale and trading investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale and trading are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
if market interest rates were to decrease by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
during  we entered into the credit facility  as amended in  or the amended credit facility 
accordingly  we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
this exposure relates to our million amended credit facility 
borrowings under the amended credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we had no amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december
