item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rates and regulation for more information on rates and regulation 
seasonal fluctuations our water business is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a material effect on customer usage 
customer demand for water generally is lower during the cooler and rainy  winter months 
demand increases in the spring when warmer weather returns and the rains end  and customers use more water for outdoor purposes  such as landscape irrigation 
warm temperatures during the generally dry summer months result in increased demand 
water usage declines during the fall as temperatures decrease and the rainy season begins 
during years in which precipitation is especially heavy or extends beyond the spring into the early summer  customer demand can decrease from historic normal levels  generally due to reduced outdoor water usage 
likewise  an early start to the rainy season during the fall can cause a decline in customer usage 
when summer temperatures are cooler than normal  water usage is generally lower 
a warmer than normal summer can result in higher customer usage 
in the past  the seasonality of water usage had a significant impact on operating revenues and net income 
in addition  the promotion of water conservation could also affect our operating revenues and net income 
during  cal water  after receiving california public utilities commission approval  changed its method of recognizing revenue and production costs with the adoption of the wram and mcba 
as a result  customer water usage does not have the same impact as in prior years 
this is discussed further in management s discussion and analysis 
drought can have an impact on the business 
when rainfall is below average for consecutive years  drought conditions can develop and certain customers may be required to reduce consumption to preserve available supply 
as an example  from to  california experienced a six year period when rainfall was below historic average 
during that period  some districts issued water rationing requirements to their customers 
in certain districts  penalties were assessed on customers who exceeded monthly allotments  which was approved by the cpuc after local governments enacted ordinances for drought 
during  the governor of california declared a drought emergency in the state and cal water s water wholesalers requested voluntary reduction in water usage 
on 
table of contents january   the california department of water resources indicated the snow content was percent of normal to date  statewide 
the financial impact of a drought  or of water rationing  has been minimized with the adoption of the wram and mcba 
water rationing will present us with challenges including changing our billing system to accommodate any penalty program  responding to customer requirements  and certain operational issues 
we are in the process of increasing our water conservation programs to promote water savings 
water supply our source of supply varies among our operating districts 
certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells  some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers  and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers 
a small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through company owned water treatment plants 
during  an estimated billion gallons of water was produced to meet customer demand  down from the estimated billion gallons produced in the average daily water production was approximately million gallons 
historically  approximately half of cal water s water supply is purchased from wholesale suppliers with the balance pumped from wells 
in approximately percent of the cal water supply was obtained from wells  percent was purchased from wholesale suppliers and percent was obtained from surface supplies 
by comparison  in  the average daily water production was approximately million gallons 
well water is generally less expensive and cal water strives to maximize the use of its well sources in districts where there is an option between well or purchased supply sources 
in california  we obtain our water supply from wells  surface runoff or diversion  and by purchase from public agencies and other wholesale suppliers 
our water supply has been adequate to meet customer demand  however  during periods of drought  some districts have experienced mandatory water rationing 
california s rainy season usually begins in november and continues through march with the most rain typically falling in december  january and february 
during winter months  reservoirs and underground aquifers are replenished by rainfall 
snow accumulated in the mountains provides an additional water source when spring and summer temperatures melt the snowpack  producing runoff into streams and reservoirs  and also replenishing underground aquifers 
there are six california water treatment plants located in the bakersfield  bear gulch  kernville  oroville and redwood valley districts 
water for operation of the bakersfield plants  with a combined capacity of million gallons per day  is drawn from the kern river under a long term contract with the city of bakersfield 
the other four plants have a combined capacity of million gallons per day 
washington and hawaii receive rain in all seasons with the majority falling during winter months 
washington water and hawaii water draw all their water supply by pumping from wells 
new mexico water s rainfall normally occurs in all seasons  but is heaviest in the summer monsoon season 
new mexico water pumps all of its water supply from wells based on its water rights 
in several of cal water s operating districts  we have service contracts with and lease equipment from basin water  inc for the treatment of water from company owned wells 
the continued treatment of water from these wells is critical to cal water s ability to meet customers demand in those districts 
on july   basin water  inc filed for chapter bankruptcy and was seeking to sell some of its assets and assignment of certain of their contracts to a third party 
the sale of the assets and assignments occurred during third quarter and did not impact our operations 
we believe there are additional suppliers that can supply the needed equipment and treatment process required in order for us to meet our water supply needs 

table of contents the following table shows the estimated quantity of water purchased and the percentage of purchased water to total water production in each california operating district that purchased water in other than noted below  all other districts receive of their water supply from wells

the oroville and redwood valley districts in the sacramento valley and the bakersfield and kern river valley districts in the san joaquin valley purchase water from a surface supply 
surface sources are processed through our water treatment plants before being delivered to the distribution system 
the bakersfield district also purchases treated water as a component of its water supply 
the chico  marysville  dixon  and willows districts in the sacramento valley  the salinas and king city districts in the salinas valley  and the selma and visalia districts in the san joaquin valley obtain their entire supply from wells 
in the salinas district  which solely depends upon ground water  several wells were taken out of service in the last four years  primarily due to poor water quality 
treatment systems have been installed on some of these wells to meet customer demand 
management believes water supply issues in the salinas district will be adequately resolved in the future by seeking additional sources or additional treatment 
purchases for the los altos  livermore  oroville  redwood valley  stockton  and bakersfield districts are pursuant to long term contracts expiring on various dates after the water supplies purchased for the dominguez  east los angeles  hermosa redondo  palos verdes  and westlake districts as well as the hawthorne and commerce systems are provided by public agencies pursuant to a statutory obligation of continued non

we work with all local suppliers and agencies responsible for water supply to insure adequate  long term supply for each system 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations water supply concerning more information on adequacy of supplies 
utility plant construction we have continually extended  enlarged  and replaced our facilities as required to meet increasing demands and to maintain the water systems 
we obtain construction financing using funds from operations  short term bank borrowings  long term financing  advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction that are funded by developers 
advances for construction are cash deposits from developers for construction of water facilities or water facilities deeded from developers 
these advances are generally refundable without interest over a period of years by equal annual payments 
contributions in aid of construction consist of nonrefundable cash deposits or facilities transferred from developers  primarily for fire protection and relocation projects 
we cannot control the 
table of contents amount received from developers 
this amount fluctuates from year to year as the level of construction activity carried on by developers varies 
this activity is impacted by the demand for housing  commercial development  and general business conditions  including interest rates 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
sale of surplus real properties when properties are no longer used and useful for public utility purposes  we are no longer allowed to earn a return on our investment in the property in the regulated business 
the surplus property is transferred out of the regulated operations 
from time to time  some properties have been sold or offered for sale 
as these sales are subject to local real estate market conditions and can take several months or years to close  income from the sale of surplus properties may or may not be consistent from year to year 
california energy situation the california energy crisis in prior years was well publicized 
there is still uncertainty about the state s ability to avoid future rolling electric blackouts  although we did not experience any major electric blackouts during or we continue to use power efficiently to minimize the power expenses passed on to our customers  and maintain backup power systems to continue water service to our customers if the power companies supplies are interrupted 
many of our well sites are equipped with emergency electric generators designed to produce electricity to keep the wells operating during power outages 
storage tanks also provide customers with water during blackout periods 
impact of climate change legislation our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and  in emergencies  power generated by our portable and fixed generators 
if future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process  our cost of power may increase 
any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our california rate payers through the mcba or included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings approved in april  the low carbon fuel standard program  which will go in to effect january   will require diesel engines to use low carbon fuel such as biodiesel or other alternatives 
this may increase the operating cost of our generators and vehicles 
we maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers  including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that will be required to be retrofitted by the end of to meet california emission standards 
if future legislation further impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards  it will increase our cost of service and our rate base 
any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
starting january   under the california environmental quality act ceqa  all capital projects of a certain type primarily wells  tanks  major pipelines and treatment facilities will require mitigation of green house gas emissions 
the cost to prepare the ceqa documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects 
this cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base  which will be requested to be paid for by our rate payers 
any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
proposed cap and trade regulations are scheduled to be approved in late and implemented in with the goal of reducing emissions to levels by the year under such regulations  if approved  we will be required to determine our carbon footprint and evaluate our electricity and fuel usage both diesel and gasoline 
we will also be required to evaluate methane emissions from our primary processes in our wastewater plants 
at this time we are unable to determine the cost impact of such regulations but any increase in operating costs associated 
table of contents with the cap and trade regulations will be included in our cost of service requested to be paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
security at company facilities due to terrorist and other risks  we have heightened security at our facilities and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers 
in  federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities  including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government 
we have complied with regulations issued by the environmental protection agency epa pursuant to our federal legislation concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required 
in addition  communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures 
while we do not make public comments on our security programs  we have been in contact with federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems security 
quality of water supplies our operating practices are designed to produce potable water in accordance with accepted water utility practices 
water entering the distribution systems from surface sources is treated in compliance with federal and state safe drinking water acts sdwa standards 
most well supplies are chlorinated or chloraminated for disinfection 
water samples from each water system are analyzed on a regular  scheduled basis in compliance with regulatory requirements 
we operate a state certified water quality laboratory at the san jose general office that provides testing for most of our california operations 
certain tests in california are contracted with independent certified labs qualified under the environmental laboratory accreditation program 
local independent state certified labs provide water sample testing for the washington  new mexico and hawaii operations 
in recent years  federal and state water quality regulations have continued to increase water testing requirements 
the sdwa continues to be amended to reflect new public health concerns 
we monitor water quality standard changes and upgrade our treatment capabilities to maintain compliance with the various regulations 
competition and condemnation our principal operations are regulated by the commission of each state 
under state laws  no privately owned public utility may compete within any service territory that we already serve without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the applicable commission 
issuance of such a certificate would only be made upon finding that our service is deficient 
to management s knowledge  no application to provide service to an area served by us has been made 
state law provides that whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility  such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss 
state statutes allow municipalities  water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems 
these agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities 
the agencies are also authorized to issue bonds  including revenue bonds  for the purpose of acquiring or constructing water systems 
however  if a public agency were to acquire utility property by eminent domain action  the utility would be entitled to just compensation for its loss 
in washington  annexation was approved in february for property served by us on orcas island  however  we continue to serve the customers in the annexed area and do not expect the annexation to impact our operations 
to management s knowledge  other than the orcas island property  no municipality  water district  or other public agency is contemplating or has any action pending to acquire or condemn any of our systems 
in recent years  consolidation within the water industry has accelerated 
a number of publicly traded water companies have been acquired or merged into larger domestic companies 
several acquisitions of publicly traded companies have also been completed by much larger foreign companies 
we intend to continue the pursuit of opportunities to expand our business in the western united states  which may include expansion through acquisitions or mergers with other companies 

table of contents environmental matters our operations are subject to environmental regulation by various governmental authorities 
environmental affairs programs have been designed to provide compliance with water discharge regulations  underground and aboveground fuel storage tank regulations  hazardous materials management plans  hazardous waste regulations  air quality permitting requirements  wastewater discharge limitations and employee safety issues related to hazardous materials 
also  we actively investigate alternative technologies for meeting environmental regulations and continue the traditional practices of meeting environment regulations 
for a description of the material effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on us  see item a 
risk factors risks related to our regulatory environment 
we expect environmental regulation to increase  resulting in higher operating costs in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on earnings 
employees at year end  we had  employees  including at washington water  at new mexico water and at hawaii water 
in california  most non supervisory employees are represented by the utility workers union of america  afl cio  except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the international federation of professional and technical engineers  afl cio 
at december   there were union employees 
in november  we negotiated wage increases with both of our unions of and other employee benefit increases  and wage increases of in the current agreement with the unions is effective through management believes that it maintains good relationships with the unions

risk factors 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our regulatory environment our business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions 
california water service company  new mexico water service company  washington water service company and hawaii water service company  inc  are regulated public utilities which provide water service to our customers 
the rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate 
these commissions set water rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected 
the commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses  to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure  and to allow us to earn what the commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital 
our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates 
our management uses forecasts  models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital 
while our rates must be approved by the commissions  no assurance can be given that our forecasts  models and estimates will be correct or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts  models and estimates 
if our rates are set too low  our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses  capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels 
we periodically file rate increase applications with the commissions 
the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
the decisions of the commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions 
even if approved  there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment 
if the rate increase decisions are delayed  our earnings may be adversely affected 
our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses 
our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities  and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases 
if a commission determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates  we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset s valuation which would be recorded through operations 
if our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory 
table of contents disallowances 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets 
if we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations  we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets 
if the commission disagrees with our characterization  we could be subjected to penalties 
furthermore  there is a risk that the commission could determine that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the ratepayers rather than our stockholders 
changes in laws  rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business 
regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons  including changes in the local political environment 
in some states  regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials  and the results of elections may change the long established rules and policies of an agency dramatically 
for example  in regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in california 
for over years prior to  the california public utilities commission allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules 
however  in  the commission reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies 
the original decision by the commission to change its policy  as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy  affected our business 
we rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures  maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property  offset certain production and operating costs  recover the cost of debt  maintain an optimal equity structure without over leveraging  and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non regulated operations 
if any of the commissions with jurisdiction over us implement policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above  our future operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  legislatures may repeal  relax or tighten existing laws  or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly 
if changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business objectives  our future operating results may be adversely affected 
we expect environmental regulation to increase  resulting in higher operating costs in the future 
our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection  health and safety laws  and regulations 
these provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water  wastewater and airborne substances 
the environmental protection agency promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards  including maximum contaminant levels mcls for drinking water 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all of the mcls promulgated to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to comply with all water quality requirements 
if we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety  we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned 
environmental laws are complex and change frequently 
they tend to become more stringent over time 
as new or stricter standards are introduced  they could increase our operating costs 
although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases  we can give no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs 
we are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis 
if the test results indicate that we exceed allowable limits  we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source 
either of these results may be costly  and there can be no assurance that the commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs 

table of contents legislation regarding climate change may impact our operations future legislation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business 
our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and  in emergencies  power generated by our portable and fixed generators 
if future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process  our cost of power may increase 
any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our california rate payers through the mcba or included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
approved in april  the low carbon fuel standard program  which will go in to effect january   will require diesel engines to use low carbon fuel such as biodiesel or other alternatives 
this may increase the operating cost of our generators and vehicles 
we maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our customers  including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that will be required to be retrofitted by the end of to meet california emission standards 
if future legislation further impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet certain emission standards  it will increase our cost of service and our rate base 
any increase in fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards will be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
starting january   under the california environmental quality act ceqa  all capital projects of a certain type primarily wells  tanks  major pipelines and treatment facilities will require mitigation of green house gas emissions 
the cost to prepare the ceqa documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects 
this cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base  which will be requested to be paid for by our rate payers 
any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
proposed cap and trade regulations are scheduled to be approved in late and implemented in with the goal of reducing emissions to levels by the year under such regulations  if approved  we will be required to determine our carbon footprint and evaluate our electricity and fuel usage both diesel and gasoline 
we will also be required to evaluate methane emissions from our primary processes in our wastewater plants 
at this time we are unable to determine the cost impact of such regulations but any increase in operating costs associated with the cap and trade regulations will be included in our cost of service requested to be paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings 
while recovery of these costs are not guaranteed  we would expect recovery in the regulatory process 
we are party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our paying damages not covered by insurance 
in  the state of california s department of toxic substances control dtsc named us as a potential responsible party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the chico groundwater 
in december  we were named along with other defendants in two lawsuits filed by dtsc for the cleanup of the plumes 
the toxic spill occurred when cleaning solvents  which were discharged into the city s sewer system by local dry cleaners  leaked into the underground water supply 
the dtsc contends that our responsibility stems from our operation of wells in the surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination plumes to spread 
while we are cooperating with the clean up  we deny any responsibility for the contamination or the resulting cleanup 
in  the company entered into court approved consent decrees consent decrees 
the consent decrees conditioned the company s performance upon many factors  including  but not limited to  water pumped and treated by the company must meet regulatory standards so the company may distribute to its customers 
pursuant to the terms of the consent decrees  the company will incur capital costs of million and future operating costs with a present value of approximately million 
in its general rate case grc settlement negotiations  division of ratepayer advocates agreed to track all costs associated with the consent decrees including legal costs to pursue insurance coverage for potential future recovery in rates 

table of contents in connection with these suits  our insurance carrier  employers insurance of wausau wausau filed a separate lawsuit against us for reimbursement of past defense costs  which approximate million  and a declaratory determination of coverage 
on january   the court heard various parties motions and on september  issued its rulings that wausau had a duty to defend  therefore  the company will not have to reimburse wausau for previously incurred defense costs 
the court did not find wausau s actions were intended to harm the company so the company will not be able to recover punitive damages 
however  the court also found that the issue of policy coverage would be determined at trial 
trial commenced on june  during trial  the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement 
which did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
the confidential settlement was fully executed on june  and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the court during the month of october the number of environmental and product related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years 
if we are subject to additional environmental or product related lawsuits  we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties 
in addition  if current california law regarding california public utilities commission s preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with california department of health services and united states environmental protection agency water quality standards changes  our legal exposure may be significantly increased 
risks related to our business operations wastewater operations entail significant risks 
while wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues  wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment 
if collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly  untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers  causing property damage or injury to aquatic life  or even human life 
liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations 
demand for our water during the warmer  dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
if temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease 
in addition  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions 
however  during the drought of the late s and early s the california public utilities commission beginning in allowed us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by customers conservation during the drought 
regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period  they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought 
furthermore  our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water 
if rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water  there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control 
interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers 
whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors  many of which are partially or completely beyond our control  including the amount of rainfall  the amount of water stored in reservoirs  
table of contents underground water supply from which well water is pumped  changes in the amount of water used by our customers  water quality  legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought  and population growth 
we purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others 
water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions  funding and other political and environmental considerations 
in addition  our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations 
if new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations  the availability of surface water may be materially reduced 
a reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources  thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results 
we have entered into long term agreements  which commit us to payments whether or not we purchase any water 
therefore  if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive 
from time to time  we enter into water supply contracts with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand 
for example  we have entered into a water supply contract with the san francisco public utilities commission which we rely upon 
we can give no assurance that the san francisco public utilities commission  or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water  will renew our contracts upon expiration  or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts 
the parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us 
maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control 
if these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us  we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs 
if we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in rationing 
rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations 
we can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards 
water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways 
for example  shortages could adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water  adversely affect operating costs  increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure  and increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water 
we may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis  or at all  for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process 
although we can give no assurance  we may also be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
changes in water supply costs impact our operations 
the cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply  wholesale suppliers prices and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand 
our source of supply varies among our operating districts 
certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells  some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers  and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers 
a small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through company owned water treatment plants 
on average  slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is 
table of contents pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers 
water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water 
during  the cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented of our total operating costs and in it represented of our total operating costs 
wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs 
purchased water rate increases are beyond our control 
in california  effective july   our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the mcba 
with this change actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs with variances  netted against variance in purchased power  pump tax  and metered revenue  recorded to revenue 
the balance in the mcba will be collected in the future 
though there may be a short term impact to cash flow from operations  the impact to earnings have been minimized 
dependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations 
purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers 
although there are back up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies  an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water 
in the past  california has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies 
there is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future 
additionally  we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply 
there are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water 
purchased power is a significant operating expense 
during and  purchased power expense represented and of our total operating costs 
these costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in california during when rates paid for electricity increased 
as with purchased water  purchased power costs are included in the mcba 
cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the commission authorizes a rate change but earnings will be minimally impacted 
cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the mcba and therefore variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations 
our ability to generate new operating contracts is affected by local politics 
our revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as well as renew operating contracts with cities  other agencies and municipal utility districts 
as our services are sold in a political environment  there is exposure to changing trends and municipal preferences 
recent terrorist acts have affected some political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of water or wastewater utility services 
municipalities own and municipal employees operate the majority of water and wastewater systems 
significant marketing and sales efforts are spent demonstrating the benefits of contract operations to elected officials and municipal authorities 
the existing political environment means decisions are based on many factors  not just economic factors 
our business requires significant capital expenditures that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase  there would be a negative impact on our results of operations 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
we invest significant funds to add or replace property  plant and equipment 
in addition  water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water 
this could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources 
in addition  we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions 
we fund our short term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers 
we also borrow funds from banks under short term bank lending arrangements 
we seek to meet our long term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations 
we cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of 
table of contents return 
in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  our expansion efforts could be curtailed  which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations 
our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities 
standard poor s rating agency issues a rating on california water service company s ability to repay certain debt obligations 
the credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook 
standard poor s rating is a with a stable outlook 
on april   standard poor s issued a rating of aa on the million first mortgage bonds issued in april 
lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital 
we can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates 
a future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations 
while the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates  we do have interest rate exposure in our short term borrowings which have variable interest rates 
we are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings 
however  if interest rates were to increase on a long term basis  our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly  subject to approval by the appropriate commission 
we can give no assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in customer rates 
we are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements 
failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing  and we could face increased borrowing costs  litigation  acceleration of maturity schedules  and cross default issues 
such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
adverse changes to the national and world wide financial system could result in disruptions in the financial and real estate markets availability and cost of short term funds for our liquidity requirements  our ability to meet long term commitments  and our customers ability to pay for water services 
this could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we rely on our current credit facilities to fund short term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations 
specifically  given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low 
we also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets or further deterioration in the strength of financial institutions could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities 
our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet its funding commitments 
longer term disruptions in the financial markets as a result of uncertainty  changing or increased regulation  reduced capital raising alternatives  or failures of significant financial institutions or other factors could adversely affect our access to liquidity 
any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for business needs can be arranged 
such measures could include deferring capital expenditures  dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash 
many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that their ability to meet their payment and supply commitments are adversely affected by the worldwide financial crisis and recession in the united states and resulting potential disruptions in the financial and real estate markets 
we operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property and other consequences of the financial crisis  which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services in certain of our districts 
in the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers  or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers  are adversely affected by these risks  we may face disruptions in supply  significant reductions in demand for our products and services  inability of customers to pay invoices when due  and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments  and other municipal entities such as water districts 
major disruptions in the financial 
table of contents strength or operations of such entities  such as liquidity limitations  bankruptcy or insolvency  could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party 
we are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
as a holding company  we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries 
of our revenues are derived from the operations of california water service company 
as a result  we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries  and california water service company in particular  to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
we can make dividend payments only from our surplus the excess  if any  of our net assets over total paid in capital or if there is no surplus  the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared 
in addition  we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due 
owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors 
our board of directors can elect at any time  and for an indefinite duration  not to declare dividends on our capital stock 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on california water service group s debt or to provide california water service group with funds for dividends 
although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us  the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations 
therefore  transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater system  including operating agreements 
risks associated with potential acquisitions  divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us 
we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies  technologies  services or products that complement our business 
the execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations 
we can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments  or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
if we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments  our ability to grow may be limited 
acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan 
they may also result in significant write offs and an increase in our debt 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks 
for example  we may incur one or more of the following problems integrating the acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products with our existing businesses and products  liabilities inherited from the acquired companies prior business operations  diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business  failure to retain key technical  management  sales and other personnel of the acquired business  
table of contents difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business  and difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals 
in addition  the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected 
the occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered 
we may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate  and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively 
we may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth 
to successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company  we believe we must effectively hire  train  integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for research and development activities  sales and marketing personnel  and financial and information technology personnel  retain key management and augment our management team  implement and improve additional and existing administrative  financial and operations systems  procedures and controls  expand and upgrade our technological capabilities  and manage multiple relationships with our customers  regulators  suppliers and other third parties 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  satisfy customer requirements  execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures 
we have a number of large volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
our revenues will decrease  and such decrease may be material  if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water 
approximately million  or of our water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers 
if any of our large business or industrial customers reduces or ceases its consumption of our water  we may seek commission approval to increase the rates of our remaining customers to offset decreased revenues 
there can be no assurance  however  that the commission would approve such a rate relief request  and even if it did approve such a request  it would not apply retroactively to the date of the reduction in consumption 
the delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues 
our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by state commissions  or in the case of the city of hawthorne and the city of commerce  the city council  which may be inclined  for political or other reasons  to limit rate increases 
however  our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase significantly 
the second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages 
these costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor 
other large components of our costs are general insurance  workers compensation insurance  employee benefits and health insurance costs 
these costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by state commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
our non regulated business operates in a competitive market 
while a majority of our business is regulated  our non regulated business participates in a competitive market 
we compete with several larger companies whose size  financial resources  customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance contracts 
due to the nature of our contract operations business  and to the very competitive nature of the market  we must accurately estimate 
table of contents the cost and profitability of each project while  at the same time  maintaining prices at a level low enough to compete with other companies 
our inability to achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of operations 
demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control 
we believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks  in part  because they seek reliable dividend payments 
if there is an over supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors  the trading price of our securities could decrease 
additionally  if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities  demand for our stock  and consequently its market price  may also decrease 
the price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future because of the volatility of the stock market and a variety of other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include regulatory developments  general economic conditions and trends  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations  actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts  actual or anticipated developments in our competitors businesses or the competitive landscape generally  litigation involving us or our industry  major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of our stock 
equity markets in general have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
such price and volume fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 
adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements 
a substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan 
at present  the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
under applicable law  we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements 
the amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan 
the funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets  discount rates  mortality rates of plan participants  pension reform legislation and a number of other factors 
there can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities 
although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years  it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment  or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results 
at december   of our  total employees were union employees 
most of our unionized employees are represented by the utility workers union of america  afl cio  except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the international federation of professional and technical engineers  afl cio 
in november we negotiated wage increases with both unions of and other changes to our employee benefit plans  and wage increases of in we believe our labor relations are good  but in light of rising costs for healthcare and pensions  contract negotiations in the future may be difficult 
furthermore  changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management s negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and or employees that decide to unionize in the future 
we are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages 

table of contents we depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team  and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace 
our operations are geographically concentrated in california and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations 
although we own facilities in a number of states  over of our operations are located in california 
as a result  we are largely subject to weather  political  water supply  labor  utility cost  regulatory and economic risks affecting california 
we are also affected by the real property market in california 
in order to grow our business  we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties  the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in california relative to other states 
the value of our assets in california may decline if there is a decline in the california real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values 
in   and we experienced an increase in uncollectible accounts which  we believe  were attributable in part to the significant declines in real estate values and rising unemployment due to the economic recession  experienced by our customers in a number of our districts in california 
in we may experience continued high levels of uncollectible accounts until real estate values rise and unemployment rates decline 
the effects of natural disasters  terrorist activity  pandemics  or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides and other natural disasters 
a significant seismic event in california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disaster in california could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations 
a major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets 
the california public utilities commission has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs 
however  we can give no assurance that the cpuc or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as mtbe  sea water incursion and possible terrorist attacks 
if our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
we operate a dam 
if the dam were to fail for any reason  we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur 
whether or not we were responsible for the dam s failure  we could be sued 
we can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit 
in light of the threats to the nation s health and security ensuing in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of 
table of contents threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
despite these tightened security measures  we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
we depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery 
were a pandemic to occur  we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve 
we retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies 
we evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually 
our evaluation considers the costs  risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage 
in addition  portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure 
furthermore  we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage  in particular  we have been  and will continue to be  affected by rising health insurance costs 
retained risks are associated with deductible limits  partial self insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings 
if we suffer an uninsured loss  we may be unable to pass all  or any portion  of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions 
consequently  uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained 
we rely on our information technology and a number of complex business systems that could malfunction and result in negative impacts on our profitability and cash flow 
our business is dependent on several complex business systems  certain of which are owned by third parties 
the business systems must function reliably in order for us to operate effectively 
among other things  system malfunctions and security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities  billing accurately and timely analysis of financial results 
our profitability and cash flow could be affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively or are circumvented 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the useful life of intangible rights  the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical claims and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefits  and possible tax allowances 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the commissions 
these accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred 

table of contents our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls and procedures  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with contractual agreements  misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material or could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  either of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability to raise future capital 
further  if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
in addition  non compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions  including the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the new york stock exchange and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock  which would further reduce our stock price 
we may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards ifrs  or other accounting or financial reporting standards  the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we could be required to adopt ifrs or other accounting or financial reporting standards different from generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america  which is currently applicable to our accounting and financial reporting 
in the sec released a timetable for the adoption of ifrs according to which we could be required to adopt ifrs by under gaap we are subject to the accounting procedures for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which  among other things  allows us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases 
currently  ifrs does not contain provisions equivalent to the current gaap accounting procedures 
the implementation and adoption of new accounting or financial reporting standards could affect our reported performance  which in turn could favorably or unfavorably impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the transition to and application of new accounting or financial reporting standards could result in increased administrative costs 
municipalities  water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action 
state statutes allow municipalities  water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems 
these agencies are empowered to condemn properties already operated by privately owned public utilities 
however  whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility  such an act constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to the utility for its loss 
if a public agency were to acquire our utility property by eminent domain action  we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss  but we would no longer have access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward

as such the company does not currently believe that there is any potential loss which is probable of occurring related to these matters and therefore no accrual or contingency has been recorded 
from time to time  the company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount of the range of loss can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies 
legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties  and the outcomes are difficult to predict 
because of such uncertainties  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty  management does not believe that when taking into account existing reserves that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview for  net income was million compared to million in  or an increase of 
the increase in net income was primarily caused by an increase in revenues to million  or a increase from net operating income increased million to million  or a increase over levels 
net other income reflected a net increase of million due primarily to gain on the cash surrender value of life insurance held for certain benefit plans in  while reflected a decline in value of such investments 
diluted earnings per share for were compared to in  or an increase of 
as a result of the general rate case grc and corresponding approved rates which were effective the first of july  we recognized a significant increase in net income 
the rate increases authorized additional annual revenues of million see discussion in the regulatory matters section of this report 
the grc included recovery of certain conservation expenses 
company conservation program expenses were approximately three million dollars in and are expected to increase in future years 
we plan to continue to seek rate relief to recover our operating cost increases and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
we expect to fund our long term capital needs through a combination of debt  common stock offerings  and cash flow from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we maintain our accounting records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and as directed by the commissions to which our operations are subject 
the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
the estimates used by management are based on historic experience and an understanding of current facts and circumstances 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is listed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe those policies where the level of subjectivity  judgment  and variability of estimates could have a material impact on the financial condition  operating performance  and cash flows of the business 
revenue recognition revenue includes monthly cycle customer billings for regulated water and wastewater services at rates authorized by regulatory commissions and billings to certain non regulated customers at rates authorized by contract with government agencies 
revenue from metered customers includes billings to customers based on monthly meter readings plus an estimate for water used between the customer s last meter reading and the end of the accounting period 
as of december  and  our unbilled revenue amount was million and million  respectively 
the unbilled revenue amount is generally higher during the summer months when water sales are higher 
flat rate customers are billed in advance at the beginning of the service period 
the revenue is prorated so that the portion of revenue applicable to the current period is included in that period s revenue  with the balance is recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheet and recognized as revenue when earned in the subsequent accounting period 
our unearned revenue liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this liability is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
effective july   cal water is operating under a water rate adjustment mechanism wram approved in february by the california public utilities commission cpuc 
under the wram  cal water records the adopted level of volumetric revenues as established by the cpuc for metered accounts adopted volumetric revenues 
in addition to volumetric based revenues  the revenue requirements approved by the cpuc include service charges  flat rate charges  and other items not subject to the wram 
the adopted volumetric revenue considers the seasonality of consumption of water based upon historical averages 
the variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts is recorded as a component of 
table of contents revenue with an offsetting entry to a current asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each cal water district 
the variance amount may be positive or negative and represents amounts that will be billed or refunded to customers in the future 
also effective july   cal water is operating under a modified cost balancing account mcba 
we track authorized expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume between adopted and actual purchased water  purchased power  and pump taxes expenses will be recorded as a component of revenue  as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to our customers at a later date 
any recovery or refund of the mcba would be netted against the wram revenue over or under recovery for the corresponding district 
the monthly balances accrue interest payable or receivable based upon the day commercial paper rate 
the balances in the wram and mcba assets and liabilities accounts will fluctuate on a monthly basis depending upon the variance between adopted and actual results 
the recovery or refund of the wram is netted against the mcba over or under recovery for the corresponding district and is interest bearing at the current day commercial paper rate 
when the net amount for any district achieves a pre determined level at the end of any calendar year ie  at least percent over or under recovery of the approved revenue requirement  cal water will file with the cpuc to refund or collect the balance in the accounts 
account balances less than those levels may be refunded or collected in cal water s general rate case proceedings or aggregated with future calendar year balances for comparison with the recovery level 
as of december   included in the net regulatory balancing accounts  current and long term assets were million and million  respectively  and the net regulatory balancing accounts current and long term liabilities were million and million  respectively 
as of december   the current net regulatory balancing accounts asset was million and the current net regulatory balancing account liability was million 
expense balancing and memorandum accounts prior to the implementation of the modified cost balancing accounts mcba the company has historically used expense balancing accounts also referred as incremental cost balancing accounts icba and memorandum accounts to track only suppliers rate changes for purchased water  purchased power  and pump taxes that are not included in customer water rates 
the cost changes were referred to as off settable expenses as under certain circumstances they were refundable either from or to customers in future rates designed to offset cost changes from suppliers 
the balancing and memorandum accounts are not recorded until the cpuc has authorized a change in customer rates and the customer has been billed 
the cumulative net amount in the expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts as of december   was approximately million 
cal water is in the process of filing for recovery through customer billings 
see rates and regulations below for descriptions of amounts included in this total that have been authorized for recovery 
the existing icba and the memorandum accounts will not be transferred to the wram mcba balances 
additions and other adjustments to these balances ended on july  however  interest will continue to accumulate on these balances until they are fully amortized through customer billings 
washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water do not have any material amounts in expense balancing or memorandum accounts 
regulated utility accounting because we operate extensively in a regulated business  we are subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities 
regulators establish rates that are designed to permit the recovery of the cost of service and a return on investment 
based upon past practices and decisions by the commissions  we assess the probability of future recovery from rate payers of certain items  including the probability of return of amounts collected to rate payers 
if it is probable that rates will recover an item in the future  a regulatory asset will be reported 
if it is probable that rates will reflect a reduction in future rates for an item  a regulatory liability will be reported 
we assess the probability of recovery of the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in each reporting period 
in addition  if a regulatory commission determined that a portion of our assets used in utility operations were not recoverable in customer rates  we would be required to determine if we had suffered an asset impairment that would 
table of contents require a write down in the assets valuation 
there have been no such asset impairments as of december  or december  goodwill accounting and evaluation for impairment during  we acquired three privately held companies on the island of hawaii waikoloa resort utilities  inc  waikoloa water company  inc  waikoloa sewer company  inc  jointly referred to as the waikoloa companies 
total assets were  including cash of  with liabilities assumed of  net of  which was paid at close of escrow and initial goodwill of  during and after the completion of the evaluation of tax benefits of the waikoloa companies net tax operating loss carryovers  goodwill was reduced by  in november of  we performed an annual impairment test of the remaining goodwill balance of  by comparing the fair value of hawaii water service company  the reporting unit  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
our analysis considered the approval of future rate case proceedings for the various operations of hawaii water service company based on historical rate of return filings allowed by the hawaii public utilities commission 
to the extent the approved rate of return filings allowed by the hawaii public utilities commission are less than expected  an impairment of the recorded goodwill may occur 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate in the period that includes the enactment date 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
if a valuation allowance were required  it could significantly increase income tax expense 
in management s view  a valuation allowance was not required at december  or december  we anticipate that future rate action by the regulatory commissions will reflect revenue requirements for the tax effects of temporary differences recognized  which have previously been passed through to customers 
the regulatory commissions have granted us rate increases to reflect the normalization of the tax benefits of the federal accelerated methods and available investment tax credits itcs for all assets placed in service after itcs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related properties for book purposes 
pension benefits we incur costs associated with our pension and postretirement health care benefits plans 
to measure the expense of these benefits  our management must estimate compensation increases  mortality rates  future health cost increases and discount rates used to value related liabilities and to determine appropriate funding 
different estimates used by our management could result in significant variances in the cost recognized for pension benefit plans 
the estimates used are based on historical experience  current facts  future expectations  and recommendations from independent advisors and actuaries 
we use an investment advisor to provide advice in managing the plan s investments 
we anticipate any increase in funding for the pension and postretirement health care benefits plans will be recovered in future rate filings  thereby mitigating the financial impact 
in september  the company adopted the fasb accounting standards which required the full recognition of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets  reflecting the funded status of the benefit plans  on the balance sheet 
we believe it is probable that future costs will be recovered in future rates and therefore have recorded a regulatory asset in accordance with fasb accounting standards 

table of contents workers compensation and other claims we are self insured for a portion of workers compensation and other claims 
excess amounts are covered by insurance policies 
for workers compensation  we work with an independent actuary firm to estimate the discounted liability associated with claims submitted and claims not yet submitted based on historical data 
these estimates could vary significantly from actual claims paid  which could impact earnings and cash flows 
for other claims  management estimates the cost incurred but not yet paid using historical information 
actual costs could vary from these estimates 
management believes actual costs incurred would be allowed in future rates  mitigating the financial impact 
contingencies for   and  the company did not record any provisions relating to the contingencies reported in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as these did not qualify as financial statement liabilities under current accounting standards

on an overall blended basis  wholesale water rates increased on a cost per million gallon basis in purchased power expenses are affected by the quantity of water pumped from wells and moved through the distribution system  rates charged by electric utility companies  and rate structures applied to usage during peak and non peak times of the day or season 
the purchased power expense increase of million was primarily due to the acquisition of systems in hawaii 
pump taxes increased million in over the cost of purchased power in the future may be impacted by climate change legislation that would impact the rates our power suppliers charge us

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased due to the increased level of our capital expenditures and our use of a higher depreciation rate as authorized by the cpuc 

table of contents our capital expenditures in california will be impacted by certain california environmental legislation passed in prior years 
the ceqa permitting process involved in certain capital projects has increased the administrative cost of certain projects 
california emission controls are expected to increase the cost of vehicle acquisitions 
certain existing vehicles will also have to be retrofitted to comply with the current legislation 
the costs are not believed to be material at this time and will be recovered via depreciation expense by our rate payers upon the filing of future general rate cases 
income taxes for  income taxes increased million as compared to for  income taxes increased million as compared to the increase in income tax for  as compared to  was due to higher pretax income and a higher effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate was   and in   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is impacted by the allowable tax benefit from an additional tax deduction for the qualified production activity deduction for income attributed to the production of water 
the tax rate is also affected by the flow through method of accounting for income taxes which resulted from differences between tax depreciation and book depreciation on both pre assets  as well as all california assets 
the flow through method of accounting is described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate the reversal of federal tax depreciation on pre assets to continue in future years  however  its effect on our tax provision is uncertain due to the offsetting flow through of state tax depreciation  which continues to increase with capital additions and the impact of cost to remove of pre assets 
property and other taxes for  expenses increased million  or from the increase is primary due to increased public service company tax due to the acquisitions in hawaii in september  increased payroll tax due to increased gross pay  increased local franchise tax  which is based upon revenue  and increased property tax  which is primary based upon our utility plant in service

rates and regulation the state regulatory commissions have plenary powers setting rates and operating standards 
as such  state commission decisions significantly impact our revenues  earnings  and cash flows 
the amounts discussed herein are generally annual amounts  unless specifically stated  and the financial impact to recorded revenue is expected to occur over a month period from the effective date of the decision 
in california  water utilities are required to make several different types of filings 
most filings result in rate changes that remain in place until the next general rate case grc 
as explained below  surcharges and surcredits to recover balancing and memorandum accounts as well as general rate case interim rate catch up surcharges are temporary rate changes  which have specific time frames for recovery 
grcs  escalation rate increase filings  and offset filings change rates to amounts that will remain in effect until the next grc 
the cpuc follows a rate case plan  which requires cal water to file a grc for each of its regulated operating districts every three years 
in a grc proceeding  the cpuc not only considers the utility s rate setting requests  but may also consider other issues that affect the utility s rates and operations 
effective in  cal water s grc schedule was shifted from a calendar year to a fiscal year with test years commencing on july st of each year 
effective with the grc  the schedule will be shifted back to a calendar year 
the cpuc is generally required to issue its grc decision prior to the first day of the test year or authorize interim rates 
as such  cal water s grc decisions  prior to  were generally issued in the fourth quarter  and from through were generally issued in the third quarter 
in accordance with the rate case plan  the commission would issue a decision on cal water s general rate case filing in the fourth quarter of with rates effective on january  between grc filings utilities may file escalation rate increases  which allow the utility to recover cost increases  primarily from inflation and incremental investment  during the second and third years of the rate case cycle 
however  escalation rate increases are subject to a weather normalized earnings test 
under the earnings test  the cpuc may reduce the escalation rate increase if  in the most recent twelve month period  this earnings test reflects earnings in excess of authorized for that district 
in addition  utilities are entitled to file offset filings 
offset filings may be filed to adjust revenues for construction projects authorized in grcs when the plant is placed in service or for rate changes charged to the company for purchased water  purchased power  and pump taxes referred to as offsettable expenses 
such rate changes approved in offset filings remain in effect until a grc is approved 
surcharges and surcredits to amortize balances in the wram and mcba accounts  which are interest bearing  will be filed in april of each year based on the district balances for the last calendar year 
surcharges are expected to be amortized over twelve months 
in the event the combined wram and mcba balance for a district is less than of revenue  the amount will not be amortized at that time 
the wram and mcba amounts are cumulative  so if they are not amortized in a given calendar year  the balance will be rolled forward and reviewed with the following year balance

rate case plan in december  the cpuc issued the california water action plan 
the plan focuses on four key principles  among other things  including safe  high quality water  highly reliable water supplies  efficient use of water  and reasonable rates and viable utilities 
in accordance with the water action plan s objective to streamline regulatory decision making the cpuc issued r

as a result  since july  cal water will be filing a company wide general rate case every three years 
rates would be effective 
table of contents approximately months from the filing date or january  in the first cycle 
as an interim measure  the cpuc allowed cal water to incorporate general operations costs including company benefits in rates for all districts in july after a decision in its general rate case 
in addition  for the sixteen districts that have a delayed effective date  the cpuc will authorize interim rates from the authorized effective date under the old rate case plan 
these interim rates will be subject to adjustment based on a final determination in the general rate case filing 
in addition to general rate case processing  the rcp set a schedule for separate cost of capital applications 
under the rcp  cal water must file its cost of capital application every three years 
the first application under this procedure was made on may  cal water s cost of capital application was consolidated with applications of two other multi district class a water utilities into a combined proceeding 
conservation application decision directed cal water to file an application to implement conservation rates and a sales decoupling mechanism 
on october   cal water filed application requesting a water revenue balancing account  a conservation memorandum account  and conservation rates 
this request was consolidated with applications filed by other water companies in the cpuc s order instituting investigation on june   cal water and two consumer groups the commission s division of ratepayer advocates dra and the utility reform network turn filed a settlement jointly proposing a program of tiered residential rates  a water revenue adjustment mechanism wram  and a modified balancing account mcba that includes changes in source mix 
tiered rates have varying charges depending on the overall monthly usage 
they are intended to provide a conservation incentive  particularly in high usage periods 
non residential rate design under the settlement emphasizes variable charges over service charges 
the wram and mcba are intended to negate any impact from customer conservation on cal water s earnings 
on february   the commission adopted the settlement 
on july   cal water made its tiered rates  wram  and mcba effective in compliance with the commission s administrative processing rules 
the submitted tariffs were administratively approved in the third quarter  effective july  in the conservation proceeding  the commission also sought to examine the effect of sales decoupling on appropriate return on equity 
on august   the commission issued its decision declining to make a specific return on equity adjustment and ordering that the issue be considered in connection with the cost of capital applications filed on may  the conservation proceeding is still open to examine the commission s non rate related conservation policies 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the proceeding with respect to these matters at this time 
regulatory activity cost of capital proceeding on may   as required under the rate case plan  cal water filed application requesting a review of its authorized rate of return 
cal water requested a rate of return on rate base of reflecting a return on common equity versus the return on common equity previously approved by the cpuc 
in september of  the commission held three days of evidentiary hearings on the applications of cal water  golden state water company  and california american water company 
the commission s division of ratepayer advocates was the only other participating party in the proceeding 
all parties filed opening and reply briefs in october  an administrative law judge issued a decision which was considered by the commission in the first quarter of the final decision was adopted on may  in decision the cpuc declined to change the adopted return on equity  reauthorizing 
however  the commission slightly changed cal water s adopted capital structure the relative amounts of debt and equity which changed the authorized overall rate of return on rate base to for all districts 
this represented an increased authorized return for eight districts and a reduced return for sixteen districts 
the overall revenue decrease for the company was calculated to be million

on july   the wutc approved a rate increase of million on an annual basis or approximately over current rates 
other regulatory proceedings in january  cal water filed offset advice letters to increase rates by million to offset increased purchased water and pump tax rates in three of its regulated districts 
these advice letters were approved effective in january as requested 
in february  cal water filed offset advice letters to increase rates by million to offset increased purchased water and pump tax rates in five of its regulated districts 
these advice letters were approved effective in february as requested 
in april  cal water filed offset advice letters to increase rates by million in seven districts to recover the capital requirements for various water treatment and distribution projects 
the commission had authorized recovery for these projects in d 
in august and in d in july of in june  cal water filed  effective in july  interim rate increases for eight districts totaling million 
these filings were approved effective in july as requested 
regulatory activity to date in february  cal water filed advice letters to offset increased purchased water and pump tax rates in six of its regulated districts totaling million in annual revenue 
under cpuc advice letter processing rules  cal water must wait for a required customer notice period for some of these districts 
therefore  cal water anticipates these increases will be approved in march or april 
while these offsets have not been approved as of february   cal water expects that they will be approved and effective as filed 
however  expense offsets are dollar for dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses and interact with the wram and mcba mechanisms so that net operating revenue is not affected by an offset increase 
on january   cal water filed an application for additional financing authority with the cpuc 
if adopted as proposed  cal water would be allowed authority to issue million of debt and common stock 
cal water cannot predict the timing or outcome of the application at this time 
throughout the calendar year  cal water plans to file advice letters to offset expected increases in purchased water and pump tax charges in some districts 
cal water cannot predict the exact timing or dollar amount of the 
table of contents changes 
however  expense offsets are dollar for dollar increases in revenue to match increased expenses and interact with the wram and mcba mechanisms so that net operating revenue is not affected by an offset increase 
in april  as allowed in the commission s rate case plan  cal water intends to file advice letters for interim rate increases for sixteen districts effective in july under the commission s prior rate case plan  these districts would have had rates effective in july the interim rate changes will be adjusted once the commission has issued a determination in cal water s grc  expected in the fourth quarter of in may  cal water intends to file for escalation rate increases effective in july for eight districts 
the cpuc s current practice on approving escalation rate increases is based partly on inflation through march inputs to the weather adjusted earnings test include recorded information through march therefore  cal water does not know the amount of its request at this time 
in november  hawaii water notified the hawaii public utilities commission of its intent to file a general rate increase application for the ka anapali service area 
such notification is required at least days before filing a rate application 
at this time  we cannot predict the timing or outcome of the proposed filing 
water supply our source of supply varies among our operating districts 
certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells  some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers  and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers 
a small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through company owned water treatment plants 
to the best of management s knowledge  we are meeting water quality  environmental  and other regulatory standards for all company owned systems 
california s normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid spring and mid fall 
the washington water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons  with the heaviest amounts during the winter 
new mexico water s rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season 
hawaii water receives precipitation throughout the year  with the largest amounts in the winter months 
water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months 
rain and snow during the winter months replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs  providing the water supply for subsequent delivery to customers 
to date  snowpack water content and rainfall accumulation during the water year is of normal as of january  per the california department of water resources 
precipitation in the prior year was below average 
management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during and beyond 
however  water rationing may be required in  if declared by the state or local jurisdictions 
long term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions 
some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards  but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during we generated cash flow from operations of approximately million  compared to million during  and million in cash flow from operations is primarily generated by net income  non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  and deferred income taxes 
cash generated by operations varies during the year 
the water business is seasonal 
billed revenue is lower in the cool  wet winter months when less water is used compared to the warm  dry summer months when water use is highest 
this seasonality results in the possible need for short term borrowings under the bank lines of credit in the event cash is not sufficient to cover operating and capital costs during the winter period 
the increase in cash flow during the summer allows short term borrowings to be paid down 
customer water usage can be lower than normal in years when more than normal precipitation falls in our service areas or temperatures are lower than normal  especially in the summer months 
the reduction in water usage reduces cash flow from operations and increases the need for short term bank borrowings 
in addition  short term borrowings are used to finance capital expenditures until long term financing is arranged 

table of contents investing activities during we used million of cash for both company funded and developer funded capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were budgeted at approximately million 
included in investing activities in was the receipt of million from our mtbe litigations 
we are currently reviewing the regulatory treatment with the cpuc and have requested a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the tax treatment 
while we have not yet determined the final accounting treatment of the proceeds  we anticipate using the proceeds on infrastructure improvements 
financing activities during  cal water issued million aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due in  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company 
pursuant to the note purchase agreements and supplements thereto under which cal water s outstanding unsecured senior notes had been issued  cal water was required to issue a new series of first mortgage bonds in exchange for each outstanding series of unsecured senior notes with a like aggregate principal amount 
the offering triggered this exchange provision 
accordingly  upon the closing of the offering  cal water was required to issue an additional series of first mortgage bonds under the mortgage indenture with a like aggregate principal amount to the holders of each series of its outstanding unsecured senior notes in exchange for each such series of notes 
in connection with the offering  cal water exercised its option to redeem the remaining million of series j first mortgage bonds due  which cal water assumed in connection with its acquisition of dominguez water corporation in the redemption was effected pursuant to the terms of the indenture and supplemental indentures governing the series j bonds 
the series j bonds were redeemed at a redemption price equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the series j bonds plus a make whole premium of million  and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
short term financing short term liquidity is provided by credit facilities extended to us and to certain of our subsidiaries and by internally generated funds 
long term financing is accomplished through use of both debt and equity 
short term bank borrowings were million at december  and million at december  cash and cash equivalents were million at december   and million at december  given our ability to access our lines of credit on a daily basis  cash balances are managed to levels required for daily cash needs and excess cash is invested in short term or cash equivalent instruments 
minimal operating levels of cash are maintained for washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water 
on october   the company and cal water entered into three year syndicated unsecured revolving line of credit agreements with sixteen banks to provide an unsecured revolving line of credit of million and million  respectively 
the base loan rate can vary from prime plus basis points to prime plus basis points depending on the company s total capitalization ration 
likewise  the unused commitment fee can vary from basis points to basis points based on the same ratio 
based on the company s planned capitalization during and future years  the company expects its pricing to be prime plus basis points with a basis point unused commitment fee 
california water service group and subsidiaries which it designates may borrow under the facilities 
borrowings by california water service company will be repaid within months unless otherwise authorized by the cpuc 
bank of america was selected as lead bank and administrative agent  with cobank and bank of china as co syndication agents 
these unsecured credit agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for credit facilities of this type including  among other things  limitations and prohibitions relating to additional indebtedness  liens  mergers  and asset sales 
also  these unsecured credit agreements contain financial covenants governing the company and its subsidiaries consolidated total capitalization ratio and interest coverage ratio 
as of december   we have met all of the covenant requirements and are eligible to use the full amount of the commitment 

table of contents credit ratings cal water s first mortgage bonds are rated by standard poor s s p 
since  the credit rating agency has maintained their rating of a and characterized us as stable 
on april   standard poor s issued a rating of aa on the million first mortgage bonds issued in april 
management believes we would be able to meet financing needs even if ratings were downgraded  but a rating change could result in a higher interest rate on new debt 
long term financing long term financing  which includes senior notes  other debt securities  and common stock  has been used to replace short term borrowings and fund capital expenditures 
internally generated funds  after making dividend payments  provide positive cash flow  but have not been at a level to meet the needs of our capital expenditure requirements 
management expects this trend to continue given our capital expenditures plan for the next five years 
some capital expenditures are funded by payments received from developers for contributions in aid of construction or advances for construction 
funds received for contributions in aid of construction are non refundable  whereas funds classified as advances in construction are refundable 
management believes long term financing is available to meet our cash flow needs through issuances in both debt and equity markets 
in september  the cpuc issued a decision granting cal water authority to complete up to million of equity and debt financing through  subject to certain restrictions 
in  our issuance of million of common stock  million was contributed to cal water 
in  under this authorization  cal water issued first mortgage bonds for million 
we are currently in the process of filing with the cpuc authorization of million for additional equity and debt financing 
in  we utilized cash generated from operations and the first mortgage bond financing 
we did not issue any significant common stock in in future periods  management anticipates funding our capital needs through a relatively balanced approach between long term debt and equity 
additional information regarding the bank borrowings and long term debt is presented in notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet transactions we do not utilize off balance sheet financing or utilize special purpose entity arrangements for financing 
we do not have equity ownership through joint ventures or partnership arrangements 
contractual obligations less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt interest payments advances for construction office leases system leases water supply contracts total our contractual obligations are summarized in the table above 
for pension and post retirement benefits other than pension obligations see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt payments include annual sinking fund payments on first mortgage bonds  maturities of long term debt  and annual payments on other long term obligations 
advances for construction represent annual contract refunds to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers 
the contracts are non interest bearing  and refunds 
table of contents are generally on a straight line basis over a year period 
system and office leases include obligations associated with leasing water systems and rents for office space 
cal water has water supply contracts with wholesale suppliers in of its operating districts and for the two leased systems in hawthorne and commerce 
for each contract  the cost of water is established by the wholesale supplier and is generally beyond our control 
the amount paid annually to the wholesale suppliers is charged to purchased water expense on our statement of income 
most contracts do not require minimum annual payments and vary with the volume of water purchased 
we have a contract with the santa clara water district  which contains minimal purchase provisions 
the contract payment varies with the volume of water purchased above the minimal levels 
management plans to continue to purchase and use at least the minimum water requirement under this contract in the future 
total paid under this contract was million in  million in  and million in the water supply contract with stockton east water district sewd requires a fixed  annual payment and does not vary during the year with the quantity of water delivered by the district 
due to the fixed price arrangement  we utilize as much water as possible from sewd in order to minimize the cost of operating company owned wells used to supplement sewd deliveries 
the total paid under the contract was million in  million in  and million in pricing under the contract varies annually 
estimated annual contractual obligations in the above table are based on the same payment level as future cost increases by sewd are expected to be offset by a decline in the allocation of costs to us as more of these costs are expected to be allocated to other sewd customers due to growth within their service areas 
on september   we entered into an agreement with kern county water agency agency to obtain treated water for our operations 
the term of the agreement is to january   or until the agency s bonds are repaid 
the agency s bonds are described below 
under the terms of the agreement  we were obligated to purchase approximately  acre feet of treated water in and an incrementally higher volume of water for each subsequent year until  when we are obligated to purchase  acre feet of treated water per year 
we are obligated to pay a capital facilities charge and a treated water charge  both of which will be expensed as invoiced  regardless of whether we can use the water in our operation  and we are obligated for these charges even if the agency cannot produce an adequate amount to supply the  acre feet in the year 
this agreement supersedes a prior agreement with kern county water agency for the supply of  acre feet of water per year 
total paid  under the prior agreement  was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
three other parties  including the city of bakersfield  are also obligated to purchase a total of  acre feet per year under separate agreements with the agency 
further  the agency has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate supplies 
the participation of all parties in the transaction for expansion of the agency s facilities  including its water purification plant  purchase of the water  and payment of interest and principal on the bonds being issued by the agency to finance the transaction  is required as a condition to the obligation of the agency to proceed with expansion of the agency s facilities 
if any of the other parties does not use its allocation in a given year  that party is still obligated to pay its contracted amount 
the agency has issued bonds to fund the project and will use the payments of the capital facilities charges by us and the other contracted parties to meet the agency s obligations to pay interest and repay principal on the bonds 
if any of the parties were to default on making payments of the capital facilities charge  then the other parties are obligated to pay for the defaulting party s share on a pro rata basis 
if there is a payment default by a party and the remaining parties have to make payments  they are also entitled to a pro rata share of the defaulting party s water allocation 
we expect to use all of its entitled water in our operations every year 
if additional treated water is available  all parties have an option to purchase this additional treated water  subject to the agency s right to allocate the water among the parties 
if we were to pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default of another participating party  we believe we could use this additional water in our operations without incurring substantial increases in incremental costs 
the total obligation of all parties  excluding us  is approximately million to the agency 
based on the credit worthiness of the other participants  which are government entities  our management believes it to be highly 
table of contents unlikely that we would be required to assume any other parties obligations under the contract due to their default 
if a party defaults  we would receive entitlement to the additional water for assuming the additional obligation 
once the project is complete  we are obligated to pay a capital facilities charge and a treated water charge that together total million annually  which equates to per acre foot 
annual payments of million for the capital facilities charge began when the agency issued bonds to fund the project 
some of the treated water charge of million began july   when a portion of the planned capacity became available 
once the entire expansion project is completed  the full annual payments will be million which will continue through the term of the agreement 
as treated water is being delivered  we will also be obligated for our portion of the operating costs  that portion is currently estimated to be per acre foot 
the actual amount will vary due to variations from estimates  inflation  and other changes in the cost structure 
our overall estimated cost of per acre foot is less than the estimated cost of procuring untreated water assuming water rights could be obtained and then providing treatment 
capital requirements capital requirements consist primarily of new construction expenditures for expanding and replacing utility plant facilities and the acquisition of water systems 
they also include refunds of advances for construction 
company funded and developer funded utility plant expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a majority of capital expenditures was associated with mains and water treatment equipment 
for  the company is estimating its capital expenditures to be between and million 
we do not expect a decline in annual capital expenditure for the next five years 
management expects us to incur non company funded expenditures in these expenditures will be financed by developers through refundable advances for construction and non refundable contributions in aid of construction 
developers are required to deposit the cost of a water construction project with us prior to our commencing construction work  or the developers may construct the facilities themselves and deed the completed facilities to us 
funds are generally received in advance of incurring costs for these projects 
advances are normally refunded over a year period without interest 
future payments for advances received are listed under contractual obligations above 
because non company funded construction activity is solely at the discretion of developers  we cannot predict the level of future activity 
the cash flow impact is expected to be minor due to the structure of the arrangements 
capital structure common stockholders equity was million compared to million at december  and  respectively 
as noted above  in additional long term debt was incurred 
during  we redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of series c preferred stock 
total capitalization  including the current portion of long term debt  at december   was million and million at december  the company intends to issue common stock and long term debt to finance our operations 
the capitalization ratios will vary depending upon the method we choose to finance our operations 
at december  capitalization ratios were common equity long term debt 
table of contents the return from both regulated and non regulated operations on average common equity was in compared to in acquisitions the following acquisitions were completed in   and in  after receiving regulatory approval  cal water acquired two water utility systems with no increase to the allowed rate base 
in addition  as part of the acquisition cal water assumed cash of million and an obligation of equal amount to fund future capital projects on behalf of rate payers 
no other assets or liabilities were assumed 
in  the company s wholly owned subsidiary hws utility services  llc  acquired contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems in hawaii 
the purchase price of million was paid with the issuance of the company s common stock 
the purchase price is being amortized over the remaining life of the contracts 
on september   after receiving regulatory approval  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  hawaii water service company  inc acquired all the outstanding stock of three related privately held companies waikoloa resort utilities  inc  waikoloa water company  inc  waikoloa sewer company  inc 
on the island of hawaii with water and wastewater operations 
the combined purchase price was million 
assets acquired were million  including cash of million 
liabilities assumed were million net of million which was paid at close of escrow 
goodwill of million was initially recorded 
in  the goodwill was reduced by million in recognition of the tax benefits of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards 
on december   after receiving regulatory approval  hawaii water acquired the water and wastewater assets of two other privately held company kukio utility company and wb maninowali for a cash price of million which was the assigned value of the assets 
no liabilities were assumed 
in  after receiving regulatory approval  we acquired for cash a water system with allowed rate base of approximately million 
in addition  in washington we acquired five water systems for million in cash  which was the approximate value of rate base of the systems 
real estate program we own real estate 
from time to time  certain parcels are deemed no longer used or useful for water utility operations 
most surplus properties have a low cost basis 
we developed a program to realize the value of certain surplus properties through sale or lease of those properties 
the program will be ongoing for a period of several years 
property sales produced pretax gains of million  none  and million in   and  respectively 
as sales are dependent on real estate market conditions  future sales  if any  may or may not be at prior year levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not participate in hedge arrangements  such as forward contracts  swap agreements  options  or other contractual agreements to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations on our assets  liabilities  production  or contractual commitments 
we operate only in the united states and  therefore  are not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
terrorism risk due to terrorist risks  we have heightened security at our facilities over the past few years and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to customers 
we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required 
in addition  communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures related to this risk 
while we do not make public comments on our security programs  we have been in contact with federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve our water delivery systems security 

table of contents interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk  although this risk is lessened because we operate in a regulated industry 
if interest rates were to increase  management believes customer rates would increase accordingly  subject to commission approval in future grc filings 
the majority of our debt is long term at a fixed rate 
interest rate risk does exist on short term borrowings within our credit facilities  as these interest rates are variable 
we also have interest rate risk on new financing  as higher interest cost may occur on new debt if interest rates increase 
stock price risk because we operate primarily in a regulated industry  our stock price volatility risk is somewhat lessened  however  regulated parameters also can be recognized as limitations to operations  earnings  and the ability to respond to certain business condition changes 
an adverse change in the stock price could make issuance of common stock less attractive in the future 
stock market performance risk our stock price could be affected by changes in the general market 
this could impact the costs of obtaining funds through the equity markets 
stock market performance could also impact us through the investments by our defined benefit plan and postretirement medical benefit plan 
we are responsible for funding these plans 
plan investments are made in stock market equities using mutual funds and in corporate bonds 
poor performance of the equity and bond markets could result in increased costs and additional funding requirements due to lower investment returns 
management believes we would be able to recover these higher costs in customer rates 
equity risk we do not have equity investments and  therefore  do not have equity risks
