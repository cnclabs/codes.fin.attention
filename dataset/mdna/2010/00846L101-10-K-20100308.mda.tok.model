item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of agfeed 
information contained herein should be read together with agfeed s financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
dollar amounts set forth in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are in thousands s unless otherwise indicated 
overview we are engaged in the animal nutrition premix  concentrate and complete feeds business and commercial hog production business in china through our operating subsidiaries 
our animal nutrition business consists of the research and development  manufacture  marketing and sale of premix  concentrate and complete feed for use in the domestic animal husbandry markets almost exclusively for hog production in china 
premix is an animal feed additive that is broadly used in commercial animal production worldwide 
we have been almost exclusively in the premix feed business since and now operate five premix  concentrate and complete feed manufacturing facilities located in the cities of nanchang  shandong  shanghai  nanning  and hainan 
we are aggressively expanding our concentrate and complete feed lines to meet the growing demand of commercial producers as they modernize their production technology and focus on the requirements of the food safety laws 
we entered the hog breeding and production business in november in this business  we mainly produce hogs for processing and sell breeding stock 
we currently have two breeder farms and meat hog producing farms in the jiangxi  shanghai  hainan  guangxi and fujian provinces 
we have developed a system of centralized raw material purchases  accounting and internal control management  corporate marketing strategies and brand building 
we have created  and centrally manage  an animal disease control response team 
this team consists of experienced chinese and international hog industry professionals that are used by each of our subsidiaries across both of our lines of business 
our increased size and economies of scale benefit us greatly in both raw materials cost savings and administrative efforts 
we had revenues of million for the year ended december  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of expanding market share in our feed business and the hog farm acquisitions and expansions we made beginning in late and throughout animal nutrition business we manufacture  distribute  market and sell three main product lines premix  concentrate and complete feeds for use in all stages of a pig s life 
we conduct these operations through our subsidiaries nanchang best  shanghai best  guangxi huijie  shandong feed  and hopejia 
we also provide educational  technical and veterinary support to our customer base our feed operating companies operate manufacturing facilities in nanchang  shanghai  nanning  shandong  and hainan provinces  primarily serving the hog industry 
each subsidiary independently conducts local marketing and sales efforts under the direction of a central executive management team 
nanchang best and guangxi huijie are primarily responsible for our ongoing research and development efforts and share their expertise in this area with all of our manufacturing operations 
during  we added independent owned feed distribution chain stores now totaling  that sell our products exclusively 
during the year we added commercial farms now totaling of china s total annual hog production is supplied by backyard and small farms that raise less than hogs per year per family 
through our network of distributors and direct sales  we are able to market our premix feed to the producers of more than of china s annual hog production 
we are one of a handful of companies that received green certification from the minister of agriculture of prc for our premix products under the brand label best 
this means that these products are safe  environmentally friendly  and can effectively promote the healthy growth of pigs 
according to current government regulations  pork cannot be accredited by the government as green unless it is produced using government certified green feed 
having our feed certified as green requires us to adhere to strict operational controls and procedures 
this green certification laid the foundation for our hog farms to produce hogs providing high quality green pork products 
it is also an incentive for other commercial hog farms to enter into sales contracts with our feed operations 
we invest capital in research and development to maintain and improve on a superior quality product while experimenting with environmentally sensitive premix formulas 
we will continue to invest up to of our revenues to increasing our long term profitability and competitiveness 
revenue increased to million in from million in fully recognizing sales from the feed division to the hog division 
this is driven by our aggressive expansion into concentrate and complete feed lines 
according to the access asia limited market analysis in their study titled fresh processed meat in china  food preferences are changing rapidly in china 
chinese people now eat much more meat than previously 
but there is also a growing diversity in the average diet 
the fresh meat market is expected to grow over from to this market value is estimated to be over billion by pork will continue to be of all fresh meat sold 
poultry  lamb  veal  mutton and beef will constitute of the growth 
in view of this we decided to explore the expansion and funding to serve the animal nutrition products needed for this growing market 
hog production business in our hog production business  we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions of current producing commercial hog farms and organic growth 
we own two breeder hog farms and meat producing hog farms located in jiangxi  shanghai  hainan  guangxi  and fujian provinces  which are strategically located in or near the largest pork consumption areas in the prc 
we entered the hog farming business on november  as a result of our acquisition of ninety percent of the capital stock of lushan 
lushan owns and operates a breeder hog farm in jiangxi province 
lushan is a mid scale hog farm engaged in the business of raising  breeding and selling hogs in the prc for use in the pork production market in the prc 
in  we acquired at least a majority interest in meat hog producing farms in the jiangxi  shanghai  hainan  guangxi  and fujian provinces through our subsidiaries nanchang best  shanghai best  guangxi huijie and best swine 
our meat hog producing farms generate revenue primarily from the sale of meat hogs to processors 
our meat hogs are sold primarily in jiangxi  shanghai  hainan  guangxi  fujian  guangdong and other neighboring provinces 
in november  we opened our first western model farm in the city of da hua  guangxi province 
in december we began stocking a second breeder farm in the city of gangda  guangxi province 
we also completed the construction of a nucleus farm in the city of wuning  jiangxi province in november this farm will be developed and operated by hypor agfeed breeding 
our breeder farms generate revenue primarily from the sale of breeder hogs to commercial hog farms and  to a lesser extent  the sale of meat hogs to hog slaughterhouses 
they also generate revenue by providing consulting services to hog farmers in the areas of feed production  feed formulation and veterinary services 
our customers include large scale hog farms  mid scale hog farms and small scale farms 
our breeder hogs are sold throughout the prc  primarily in southeastern china 
capital spending for consisted of approximately million on building renovations and million on equipment purchases and environmental expenditures 
our current capital spending plans over the next two years include an estimated million for bio security  million for environmental compliance and projects and million for genetics programs 
in  we sold approximately  head with an average selling price of per head at an average weight of kg lbs 
as compared to sales of  hogs with an average selling price of per head for at an average weight of kg lbs  a difference of less per hog this year 
on april  we formed a strategic alliance with hypor 
the alliance has four phases upgrading the genetic base of our existing herds  creating a sow farrow to finish nucleus facility wuning farms to supply superior breeding stock to be utilized in our production systems and for sale to outside commercial hog farms  establishing high health  top quality genetics to the farms being developed by agfeed international protein  and developing gene transfer centers to maximize the use of the top performing boars in china across agfeed s production system 
on december   we formed hypor agfeed breeding company with hypor to develop  operate and market a genetic nucleus farm in wuning  china 
hypor agfeed breeding is owned by us and by hypor 
on july   we formed agfeed international protein with mp  a joint venture focused on enhancing hog production systems for chinese and other pan asian clients based on modern western standards to increase productivity and ensure the highest bio security health standards in the pan asian hog industry 
the joint venture was formed to take advantage of the commercialization and consolidation of the hog industry being fostered by the chinese central and local governments 
we are agfeed international protein s first client 
we own of agfeed international protein  certain affiliates own an additional and mp owns the remaining 
on november   construction began on of our first large western model farm in da hua  china jiangxi province 
this is the first of six farms that will be constructed in south china that will house an additional  genetically superior sows and boars 
when fully operational  we anticipate that these farms will produce  pigs per year 
it is anticipated that the cost to build the six farms will be approximately million over the next two years 
agfeed international protein has completed all phases of design and blueprints for these farms and has been working with international and local construction firms to ensure success 
our current strategic plan calls for development of a platform for the production and sale of approximately million hogs into the chinese market between and the end of the key element to this future growth is scientific breeding  which is underscored by our arrangement with hypor 
in april we began this by stocking the  sow farrow to finish lushan breeding farm with the hypor large white pureline sows  the hypor landrace pureline boars and the duroc terminal sire 
in november  we began stocking our second breeder farm  gangda farm  with like genetics our investment plans also include modernization of our existing pork production facilities  investment in reporting and cash management systems and the training of our employees  and the development of enhanced environmental and health safety programs including upgraded bio security measures 
these actions are part of our effort to improve on the standards of the new china food safety law that was implemented on june  and to ensure the production of consistently high quality  safe pork 
according to the china feed industry association  china has the world s largest and most profitable market for hog production  which processed million hogs in  compared to approximately million in the us 
more than billion chinese consume pork as their primary source of meat 
of all meat consumed in china is pork 
chinese consumers consume more pork each year than the rest of the world combined 
china s pork consumption is forecast to increase to million metric tons in up from million metric tons in  an increase of about 
projected pork demand by is estimated to approach million metric tons  an increase of the chinese government supports hog producers with favorable tax status and subsidies  insurance  vaccines  caps on feed costs and land use grants 
hog production is exempt from all taxes and sow owners receive government grants and subsidies 
the food safety law  which went into effect on june   provides a legal basis for the government to strengthen food safety control from the production line to the dining table 
the importance the prc puts on hog production is exemplified by the adoption of new policies and enactment of new laws benefiting hog producers 
in january  the chinese central government instituted a set of measures that could prevent large declines in hog prices with the view of stabilizing hog production and hog prices in order to protect the interest of hog farms 
in july  the ndrc announced that they were channeling billion rmb for livestock farm construction and another billion rmb to support live pig production 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
use of estimates 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of long lived assets and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
areas that require estimates and assumptions include valuation of accounts receivable and inventory  determination of useful lives of property and equipment  estimation of certain liabilities and sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continually monitor customer payments and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
in determining the reserve  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors 
in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on our historical write off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due  customer credit worthiness  geographic risk and the current business environment 
actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
our evaluation includes the analysis of future sales demand by product  within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of projected future demand are written down to net realizable value 
in addition  we assess the impact of changing technology on inventory balances and writes down inventories that are considered obsolete 
inventory obsolescence and excess quantities have historically been minimal 
long lived assets 
we periodically assess potential impairments to our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
factors we considered include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  based on the fair market value if available  or discounted cash flows 
to date  there has been no impairment of long lived assets 
property and equipment 
useful lives of property and equipment is based on historical experience and industry norms 
changes in useful lives due to changes in technology or other factors can affect future depreciation estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue is recognized when services are rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the delivery is completed  no other significant obligations of agfeed exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue 
we are not subject to vat withholdings 
we give volume rebates to certain customers based on volume achieved 
we make estimates and judgments when determining whether the collectability of revenue from customers is reasonably assured 
management estimates regarding collectability impact the actual revenues recognized each period and the timing of the recognition of revenues 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future collectability could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
sales returns and allowances have historically been insignificant 
accordingly  estimating returns is not critical 
however  if circumstances change  returns and allowance may impact the company s earnings 
there are no differences in our arrangements with our different types of customers 
accordingly  we do not have different revenue recognition policies for different types of customers 
we offer credit terms ranging from to days for most customers 
from some large customers  we may extend these terms beyond days 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles amendments based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asu no 

asu no 
re defines authoritative gaap for nongovernmental entities to be only comprised of the fasb accounting standards codification codification and  for sec registrants  guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is a reorganization and compilation of all then existing authoritative gaap for nongovernmental entities  except for guidance issued by the sec 
the codification is amended to effect non sec changes to authoritative gaap 
adoption of asu no 
only changed the referencing convention of gaap in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an asu regarding accounting for own share lending arrangements in contemplation of convertible debt issuance or other financing 
this asu requires that at the date of issuance of the shares in a share lending arrangement entered into in contemplation of a convertible debt offering or other financing  the shares issued shall be measured at fair value and be recognized as an issuance cost  with an offset to additional paid in capital 
further  loaned shares are excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share unless default of the share lending arrangement occurs  at which time the loaned shares would be included in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for arrangements outstanding as of the beginning of those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in codification subtopic the fasb s objective is to improve these disclosures and  thus  increase the transparency in financial reporting 
the adoption of this asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  years ended december  change change revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses interest and financing costs net income revenues 
the increase was due to volume sales of both hogs and animal feed products 
hog sales of  for year ended december  exceeded total hog sales of  hogs for the year ended december  animal feed sales volume for year ended december  exceeded  metric tons representing a increase in volume over the comparative period of however  the increase in revenue described above was offset by lower sales prices  an increase in ingredient costs  consumer reaction to the hna scare and the country wide drought 
cost of goods sold 
we experienced increases in the unit cost of goods sold for our two business lines during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these raw materials constitute approximately of our raw material costs 
corn and soybean meal cost rose and  respectively  versus the year ended december  china has implemented programs to mitigate additional price increases in order to stabilize these markets 
in order to provide excellent customer service and differentiate ourselves from our competition  at our customers request  we supply them with customized formulations of our products 
in any given month  the cost of various additives used in our production fluctuates  which can result in temporary increases in the unit cost of goods sold 
these increased costs offset our increases in revenues 
even though this may have an adverse effect on our short term profits  we take the long term view that this practice results in increased customer loyalty  builds the agfeed brand and will ultimately lead to increased sales and gross profits 
in addition  we are presently experiencing more stable pricing in these additives  which we anticipate will stabilize our cost of goods sold 
gross profit 
gross margins decreased to from during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in gross margin can be attributed to the increase in the cost of hog feed that began in the last half of and continued into and a reduction in the selling price for our hogs 
the increase in the cost of hog feed was offset somewhat by actions taken in the first quarter of  including expansion of our product distribution channels  and our entry into long term contracts for key product ingredients which locked in favorable cost savings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense includes overhead expenses such as rent  management and staff salaries  general insurance  marketing  accounting  legal and offices expenses 
our selling expenses for the year ended december  were only slightly less than the corresponding period in general and administrative expenses for our feed segment increased by approximately  or approximately from the corresponding period in principally due to the overall expansion of our feed business and the increase of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our corporate expenses also increased by approximately  due to higher professional fees 
general and administrative expenses for our hog farms for the year ended december  increased by approximately  for over the corresponding period in to due to more hog farms being in operations in interest and financing costs 
we incurred interest and financing costs of million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively  principally as a result of the issuance of million principal amount of convertible notes issued during february during the year ended december  and  million and million  respectively  of the convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock which resulted in accelerated amortization of the debt discounts and debt issue costs associated with the convertible debt 
due to appreciation in rmb against the usd in  we incurred a loss on foreign translation of million during the year ended december   as we could not timely convert usd deposits into rmb as a result of bank policies and banking rules in the prc 
this was a one time  non recurring charge 
foreign currency translation losses in were not significant income taxes 
hog production is an income tax exempt sector in china and sow owners receive government grants and subsidies 
some of our feed manufacturing companies benefit from exemption from value added tax 
net income 
the decrease in our net income was due to the increase in cost of goods sold and higher operating expenses 
we continued to benefit from the tax exempt status for our hog production business 
the higher sales and the benefits from economies of scale in our business resulting in a modest increase in operating efficiency was offset by higher cost of sales and a charge to earnings to reflect the increase in our derivative liability 
we continued to benefit from the tax exempt status for our hog production business 
comparison of years ended december  and december  years ended december  change change revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses interest and financing costs net income revenues 
compared to the same period in  the increase in revenues was due to an increase in the volume of feed products that we sold and the acquisition of our hog farms 
the increase in feed product sales was a result of expanding our distribution channels by the opening of additional exclusive distribution stores for our products 
we experienced favorable market conditions that increased the demand for our feed products 
a stronger agfeed brand name allowed us to successfully increase our price twice in the second quarter of due to softening in the market for hog prices  we experienced a decrease in the selling price for our hogs during the second half of however  as a result of economies of scale  we were able to cut hog production cost through centralized raw materials purchases  sales and marketing channels  and finance and internal control management 
cost of goods sold 
we experienced increases in the unit cost of goods sold for our two business lines during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the cost of goods sold included costs in both premix feed and hog production 
these raw materials constitute approximately of our raw material costs 
gross profit 
gross margins decreased to from during the year ended december  as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in gross margin can be attributed to the increase in the cost of hog feed during the last two quarters  and a substantial general sell off of swine inventory resulting in falling prices after the olympics ended 
this was modified somewhat by actions taken in the first half of  including expansion of our product distribution channels  and our entry into long term contracts for key product ingredients which locked in favorable cost savings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense includes overhead expenses such as rent  management and staff salaries  general insurance  marketing  accounting  legal and offices expenses 
the increase in our selling  general and administrative expense also reflects the addition of our new subsidiaries  which had a total of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses during selling expenses for the period increased by due to costs associated with the aggressive expansion into markets in neighboring provinces  and the costs associated with the absorption of our new subsidiaries 
interest and financing costs 
we incurred interest and financing costs of approximately million during  principally as a result of the issuance of million principal amount of convertible notes issued during february million of the convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock  resulting in the non recurring accelerated amortization of the debt issuance costs and debts discounts amounting to approximately million 
due to foreign exchange appreciation in rmb against the usd  we incurred a one time  non recurring loss on foreign translation of  during  as it is hard to timely convert usd deposits into rmb to implement these procedures due to safe regulations 
hog production is an income tax exempt sector in china and sow owners receive government grants and subsidies 
our feed manufacturing companies benefit from exemption from value added tax 
net income 
the increase in our net income was due to higher sales and the benefits from economies of scale in our business resulting in a modest increase in operating efficiency 
this was offset by one time  non operational related charges and interest expenses associated with the conversion of a portion of the million of convertible notes by investors during we continued to benefit from the tax exempt status for our hog production business 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended december  that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our interests 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
during first quarter of  we completed two financings 
we received aggregate gross proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of common stock at per share 
we received aggregate proceeds of million through the issuance of three year convertible notes bearing interest at and convertible into common stock at per share 
in connection with the convertible notes  we issued  warrants which are exercisable immediately and have a strike price 
the exercise price on the warrants was subsequently reduced to per share 
we paid offering costs of  related to the sale of shares and  related to the issuance of the convertible notes 
on april   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors in connection with a registered direct offering of securities providing for the issuance of  shares of our common stock at price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of  we paid  in costs related to this offering 
on april   we entered into securities purchase agreements with institutional investors in connection with a registered direct offering of securities providing for the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
we paid  in costs related to this offering 
on december   we completed a financing and raised gross proceeds of million through the sale to institutional investors of million newly issued common stock units at per unit under an effective form s registration statement 
each unit consists of one share of newly issued common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock for a share  which is exercisable over a five year period 
we paid costs related to this offering of from october  through october   the company repurchased  shares of our common stock for  no additional shares have been repurchased 
on may   we closed a private placement by issuing  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of million to certain institutional investors 
we also issued  common stock purchase warrants to the investors and  common stock purchase warrants to the placement agent for the transaction 
the warrants are exercisable immediately have an exercise price of per share and expire on may  we paid costs related to this offering of million 
on september   we entered into an equity credit agreement with an institutional investor  which was amended and restated as of november   providing for  among other things  the issuance of shares of its common stock at any time and from time to time during the next two years for gross proceeds of up to  in connection with the closing of the transaction  we also issued warrants to purchase an additional  shares of its common stock during a five year period at an exercise price of per share 
this transaction closed on september  no shares have been issued under the terms of the equity credit agreement 
during  certain warrant holders exercised  warrants that resulted in gross proceeds of  as of december   we had short term loans outstanding of  the loan was entered into during the second quarter of and is due in may during the year ended december   we generated  of cash from our operating activities 
the cash generated was generated primarily through the net income including noncontrolling interest  a decrease in other receivables and an increase in accounts payable offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in other payables 
we used approximately million in investing activities during the year ended december   of which million was for the acquisition of property and equipment 
we also sold our interest in two subsidiaries for  we generated million in cash from financing activities as a result of the sale of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million and the exercise of  warrants for proceeds of million 
we generated cash of million from issued short term loans and used cash of million was for the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in four subsidiaries 
at december   our accounts receivable balance was approximately million  an increase of million from december  our principal demands for liquidity are to increase capacity  purchase raw materials  distribute our products  consolidate our existing farm operations and make strategic acquisitions or investments in our industry as opportunities present themselves  as well as general corporate purposes 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the latest pipe for the development of our genetics program and other growth initiatives 
we may seek additional funds from the capital markets to further support our genetics program to increase hog production and profitability 
we expect our genetics program to be accretive to earnings in the near future 
we intend to meet our liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment  purchase of raw materials  and the expansion of our business  through cash flow provided by operations and funds raised through cash investments 
the majority of our revenues and expenses were denominated in rmb  the currency of the prc 
there is no assurance that exchange rates between the rmb and the usd will remain stable 
contractual obligations no contractual obligation occurred during the year ended december  and therefore it is not expected to have any effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
inflation and seasonality demand for our products remains fairly consistent throughout the year and we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation or seasonality 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk substantially all of our operations are conducted in the prc  with the exception of our limited export business and overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in rmb  which is the official currency of the prc 
the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rates is considered minimal to our business operations 
substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb 
however  we use us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from its operations in the prc 
interest rate risk we have interest rate risk related to the short term notes entered into during the quarter ended september   however  we do not believe this interest risk is significant 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk  as most of our customers are long term customers with superior payment records 
our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers
