includes full time equivalent general or specialist dentists employed by or contracted with the affiliated practices 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of dental facilities  support staff and business services to multidisciplinary dental group practices in selected markets throughout the united states 
we are committed to the success of the affiliated practices  and we make substantial investments to support each affiliated practice s growth 
we provide or assist with organizational planning and development  recruiting  retention and training programs  quality assurance initiatives  facilities development and management  employee benefits administration  procurement  information systems and practice technology  marketing and payor relations  and financial planning  reporting and analysis 
at december  we were affiliated with dental group practices  comprising full time equivalent dentists practicing in dental facilities in states 
our net revenue depends primarily on revenue generated by the affiliated practices 
demand for dental care has declined among patients both with and without dental insurance 
we estimate approximately of patients at the affiliated practices have dental insurance 
in general  dental insurance covers of preventative care  of basic restorative procedures and of more extensive restorative procedures 
in addition  dental insurance often caps benefits at an annual maximum of  to  as a result  even patients with dental insurance are financially responsible for a considerable portion of their dental expenditures 
the recent economic downturn has caused consumer spending patterns to change 
the affiliated practices have observed patients either delaying care or  for those patients with dental insurance  opting for dental procedures that are largely covered by insurance 
as a result  revenue growth rates of the affiliated practices have decreased and revenue mix has shifted towards lower cost and lower profitability dental procedures 
the effect to us has been lower net revenue and lower profit margins 
we anticipate that negative macroeconomic conditions will continue to adversely affect our business in  although we are unable to predict the likely duration or severity of those conditions or the magnitude effect on our business or results of operations 
we do not  however  believe that the current economic conditions will lessen the dental care needs of patients and do not therefore expect lasting long term impact on the dental care industry 
acquisition and affiliation summary when affiliating with a dental practice  we customarily acquire selected assets and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the affiliated practice is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and  we completed  and acquisition and affiliation transactions  respectively 
in five of these transactions  we acquired non clinical assets and entered into long term service agreements with the affiliated practices 
in one of these transactions  we developed de novo dental facilities rather than acquiring non clinical assets  and we entered into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
in of these transactions  we completed in market practice acquisitions  which became subject to existing service agreements 
these acquisition and affiliation transactions resulted in the addition of dental facilities and operatories 
the  and acquisition and affiliation transactions  at the time of the transactions  generated   and  of pro forma patient revenue on an annualized basis  respectively 
we are constantly evaluating potential acquisition and affiliation transactions with dental practices and acquisitions of other dental related companies that would expand our business capabilities 
litigation settlement agreements in december  we entered into a settlement agreement in the litigation matter with pdg  pa  formerly the affiliated practice at park dental 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the service agreement with pdg was 
table of contents terminated effective december   and we transferred the operating assets of of the park dental facilities and the park dental trade name to pdg 
we retained the remaining six dental facilities  which were combined with metro dentalcare 
we also entered into a transition services agreement with pdg to provide services for a period of nine months through september  for  which was recorded as  in net revenue and  as an offset to the litigation loss 
we completed the transition services  received the related  payment and completed the final steps in the termination of the relationship with pdg 
as a result of the pdg settlement  our results of operations may not be comparable period to period and may not reflect the results of operations to be expected in future periods 
revenue overview net revenue our net revenue includes management fees earned by us pursuant to the terms of the service agreements with the affiliated practices  as well as reimbursement of clinic expenses paid by us on their behalf  and other revenue  which includes patient revenue of arizona tooth doctor  fees earned by our dental benefits third party administrator or fees earned by our dental laboratory and other miscellaneous revenue 
for  other revenue also includes fees earned under the transition services agreement with pdg 
the following table provides the components of our net revenue for  and in thousands reimbursement of expenses business service fees revenue earned under service agreements other revenue net revenue includes  earned from the transition services agreement with pdg see litigation settlement agreements 
revenue earned from business service fees and reimbursed expenses under the terms of the affiliated practice service agreements represented  and of net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in other revenue in was due to revenue earned under our transition services agreement with pdg 
we believe both the affiliated practices and our other revenue sources have been affected by changes in the us economy that we believe have influenced discretionary spending for dental services not covered wholly or significantly by dental benefit plans 
the arizona tooth doctor business is directly affected by patient care service reimbursed under arizona s medicaid program 
fees earned under service agreements include reimbursement of expenses incurred by us on behalf of the affiliated practices in connection with the operation and administration of dental facilities and business service fees charged to the affiliated practices pursuant to the terms of the service agreements for management services provided and capital committed by us 
under certain service agreements  representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of a monthly fee that is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under certain service agreements  representing of our business service fees  our business service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement between us and the affiliated practice in a formal planning process 
under certain other service agreements  representing less than of our business service fees  our business service fee consists of either a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the planned amount for the current year  a specified percentage of patient revenue or a specified percentage of collections on patient revenue 

table of contents we account for net revenue from the reimbursement of expenses on an accrual basis and recognize revenue when these expenses are incurred by the affiliated practices 
reimbursement of expenses includes costs incurred by us for the operation and administration of the dental facilities  which include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
other revenue includes patient revenue of arizona tooth doctor  fees earned by our dental benefits third party administrator  dental laboratory fees and other miscellaneous revenue 
patient revenue of the affiliated practices we believe it is important for investors to understand patient revenue of the affiliated practices  which with the exception of arizona tooth doctor  we do not own or control 
we do not consolidate the financial statements of these affiliated practices with ours  and accordingly their patient revenue is not a measure of our financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
it is however  a financial measure we use to monitor operating performance and to help identify and analyze trends of the affiliated practices that may affect our business 
most of the operating expenses incurred by us  pursuant to the service agreements  are on behalf of the affiliated practices in the operation of dental facilities 
these expenses are significantly affected by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
the affiliated practices generate revenue from providing care to patients and receive payment from patients and dental benefit providers  or payors  under fee for service  ppo plans  and dental referral plans and managed care capitation plans 
patient revenue reflects the amounts billed by an affiliated practice at its established rates reduced by any contractual adjustments and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
contractual adjustments represent discounts off established rates negotiated pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts with the affiliated practices 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the following table provides the aggregate payor mix of all affiliated practices for the years ended december fee for service ppo and dental referral plans capitated managed care plans for the affiliated practices that we do not own and are affiliated with us by means of a service agreement  after collection of fees from patients and third party insurers for the provision of dental care and payment to us of our service fee and reimbursement of clinic expenses incurred by us on their behalf  the amounts remaining are used by these affiliated practices for compensation of dentists and  in certain states  hygienists and or dental assistants who are employed by them

if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of goodwill  receivables due from the affiliated practices  other intangible assets  loss reserves for our captive insurance company and contingent accruals for litigation in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and  in certain instances  actuarial studies conducted by third parties  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
valuation of accounts receivable our accounts receivable include amounts due from the affiliated practices that have entered into service agreements with us and amounts due from insurance companies  patients for arizona tooth doctor  our dental benefits third party administrator and our dental laboratory businesses 
at december   amounts due from affiliated practices represented of our accounts receivable 

table of contents the carrying amount of receivables due from the affiliated practices requires management to assess the collectability of the fees we earn pursuant to the service agreements 
collection of our service fees are dependent on the economic viability of the affiliated practices based on actual and expected future financial performance  including collectability of the affiliated practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the affiliated practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at patient revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts in which there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
each affiliated practice s provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated practice s patient receivables would be required  which could impact the collectability of our receivables due from the affiliated practice 
except for accounts receivable due from pdg  which we agreed to forgive pursuant to the litigation settlement  to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from the affiliated practices and accordingly have not recorded any reserves for uncollectability 
we have recorded reserves for uncollectability against accounts receivable of arizona tooth doctor  our dental benefits third party administrator and our dental laboratory businesses based on historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
goodwill and intangible assets we have intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable intangibles assets  which are the result of affiliation transactions and acquisitions of businesses 
the initial identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of useful lives at the time of affiliation or acquisition involve the use of management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  reviews of projected future income  cash flows  statutory regulations and  when necessary  input from accredited valuation consultants 
at december   goodwill and intangible assets were  and represented of our total assets  with goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets representing of our intangible assets and definite lived intangible assets related to service agreements representing of our intangible assets 
our affiliations with dental practices as a result of the parties entering into a service agreement are not business combinations  and as such  do not result in recognition of goodwill 
we recognize capitalized service agreement costs  which are accounted for as definite lived intangible assets acquired in affiliations other than a business combination and are recorded at fair value 
in determining the fair value of a service agreement recognized in connection with an affiliation  management estimates the timing  amount and value of future expected cash flows 
these service agreements have contractual terms of years  but the asset is generally amortized on a straight line basis over a period of years 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the related affiliated practice is required  at our option in nearly all instances  to purchase the remaining unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  purchase other assets at the greater of fair value or book value and assume leases and other liabilities related to the performance of our obligations under the service agreement 
we review identified intangible assets with definite useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually as of october and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has fallen below its carrying amount  such as a significant adverse change in the assets utilized by the business 
determining whether an 
table of contents impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting business unit  which we estimate using a discounted cash flow method 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results 
in applying this methodology  we rely on a number of factors  including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections and market data 
if this analysis indicates goodwill is impaired  measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset 
in this case  we would supplement the cash flow approach discussed above with independent appraisals 
we tested for impairment as of october   which included various scenarios with varying revenue  expense and capital investment assumptions and determined there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
our dental benefits third party administrator historically earned a significant percentage of its revenue from administering capitated managed care plans 
as a result of the continuing decline of capitated managed care plans in the dental profession  our dental benefits third party administrator has been developing additional product offerings  including dental referral plans  to offset the decline of this part of its business 
in  our dental benefits third party administrator experienced a reduction of revenue and incurred an operating loss as a result of the continuing decline of administrative services for capitated managed care plans 
based on its business plan and future projections  we determined the fair value of this business reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of  at october  if this business plan is not successfully executed or projected financial results are not achieved  we may need to record an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the goodwill of this reporting unit 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and other intangible assets  a material change could possibly occur in the future 
if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis  which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets 
insurance we maintain various insurance coverages that we believe are appropriate for our business  including workers compensation  property  business interruption and general liability  among others 
in addition  the affiliated practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
certain of our insurances are reinsured by a wholly owned captive insurance company licensed in the state of vermont 
several of these insurance programs have retention levels in which we and our captive insurance company are financially obligated for insured losses below certain financial thresholds before the insurer is financially obligated for insured losses 
we and our captive insurance company maintain reserves for certain of these programs  which are based upon estimates provided by third party actuaries or by individual case basis valuations 
changes in trends of loss severity or loss frequency may affect the calculation of these estimates and create the need for subsequent adjustments to estimated loss reserves 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of authoritative guidance for stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected life  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected life volatility and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions and the market value of our stock for future stock option grants can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of stock based compensation 
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the 
table of contents taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties in income taxes 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory rates applicable to future years to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts to provide insight 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
we are subject to income tax arising from us federal government and multiple state jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing authorities 
the tax years and have been audited by the internal revenue service and are closed to examination 
tax year and remains open to examination 
our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record these items as expense 
for the year ended december    of interest expense and  of tax expense related to penalties were recognized in our statement of earnings  compared with  and  respectively  for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting and standards board  or fasb  issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the purpose of the amendment is to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction 
the changes from the previous guidance include  but are not limited to acquisition costs are recognized separately from the acquisition  known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition are considered part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value  all other contingencies are part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability  contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events is recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition  business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as noncontrolling interests  in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values  and a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree requires that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
the provisions of the amendment are only applicable for our transactions that qualify as business combinations and not our affiliation transactions 
no material effect at adoption but may materially affect accounting for future business combinations 
the fasb issued an amendment to accounting and disclosure requirements for consolidated financial statements with a focus on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financials statements 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the amendment was issued to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  the amendment eliminates the diversity that existed in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
preferred securities  including noncontrolling interests  that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date  at the option of the holder or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within 
table of contents the control of the issuer 
accordingly  we have classified noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity and not as part of equity 
the fasb issued an amendment to accounting and disclosure requirements for derivative instruments with a focus on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november  this amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities and encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
the company adopted the amendment and applicable disclosures are included 
in april  the fasb issued additional guidance on accounting and disclosures for fair value with a focus on identifying and disclosing assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity have significantly decreased 
the fasb also issued authoritative guidance relating to accounting for impaired debt securities 
these standards are effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  we adopted the interim disclosure requirement of fair value and determined that the remaining additional accounting guidance has no current application see summary of significant accounting policies  fair value measurement for further discussion 
in may  the fasb issued new accounting and disclosure guidance with respect to disclosures on subsequent events 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  this statement incorporates guidance into accounting literature that was previously addressed only in auditing standards 
subsequent events are referred to as either type i events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date or type ii events that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date but arose subsequent to that date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
recognized subsequent events type i should be recognized in the financial statements 
nonrecognized subsequent events type ii should not be recognized in the financial statements but the nature of the event and an estimate of its financial effect disclosed 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
the new guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requires additional disclosures in order to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the amendment will not have a material impact on our consolidated results 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after november  the amendments include i the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities  ii a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity and iii changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable interest entity 
the amendment is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november  and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period 
the amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification 
the codification is the single source for all authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for periods ending after september  the codification does not change gaap and did not have an affect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
other new pronouncements issued by the fasb that are not effective until after december  are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  financial position  results of operations or liquidity or that are not relevant to us are not included above 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our senior secured credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins ranging from to for prime borrowings and to for libor borrowings based upon our debt coverage ratio 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value  but do not affect earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
in addition  we have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to fix the interest rate on  of our borrowings 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year  based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility and term loan  for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum
