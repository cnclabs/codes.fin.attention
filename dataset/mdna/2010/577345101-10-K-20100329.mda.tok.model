item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview of the company we operate as a landholding and operating parent company for our principal subsidiaries  including maui pineapple company  ltd 
and kapalua land company  ltd 
our reportable segments are resort and community development 
our agriculture segment was discontinued  and was reported as discontinued operations for the year ended december  agriculture on november   our board of directors approved the cessation of our pineapple agriculture operations by december  the agriculture segment primarily included growing  packing  and marketing of fresh pineapple 
our pineapple was sold under the brand names maui gold and hawaiian gold tm 
we also grew and marketed fresh organic pineapple 
a portion of our business included processing canning pineapple  however  we ceased substantially all canning and processing of solid pack product in june in december  we entered into agreements with an unrelated  closely held company that began to grow and market maui gold pineapple as of january  
table of contents resort the resort segment includes our ongoing operations at the kapalua resort 
these operations currently include two championship golf courses  a tennis facility  and several retail outlets 
prior to mid december  the resort operations also included a vacation rental program the kapalua villas  kapalua adventures  which is comprised of zip lines stretching over scenic ravines in the west maui mountains  a high ropes challenge course  a climbing wall and other activities 
in december  we entered into agreements to transfer the operations of the kapalua villas and the kapalua adventures to third parties 
in march  we sold the plantation golf course for million and entered into an agreement to lease back the golf course for a two year period note to consolidated financial statements 
community development the community development segment includes our real estate entitlement  development  construction  sales and leasing activities 
this segment also includes the operations of kapalua realty company  a general brokerage real estate company  and public utilities commission regulated water and sewage transmission operations located within the kapalua resort 
beginning august   the community development segment includes our investment in bay holdings note to consolidated financial statements 
global economic conditions have caused consumers  tourists and real estate investors to postpone or reduce spending in response to tighter credit  higher energy costs  negative financial news and or declines in income or asset values  which has negatively affected the demand for our products and services 
increases in fuel and other energy costs  conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets  interest rates  labor costs  access to credit  consumer confidence  and other macroeconomic factors have also affected consumer spending behavior 
these and other economic factors could continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of the impact of economic conditions and other factors we considered  we have evaluated our investment in bay holdings for impairment in and and have recorded other than temporary impairment losses of million and million  in and  respectively 
also in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for the write off of development plans and other project costs that have been abandoned or are not otherwise expected to be recoverable because of the delay of the start of construction of new development projects in the fourth quarter of caused by  among other things  the economic recession  a worsening credit market  reduced demand for real estate  and declining consumer confidence subsequent to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements  we concluded that cash flows from the sale of undeveloped land should have been reflected within the operating activities section of the cash flow statement rather than within the investing activities section because the sale of undeveloped land is considered a principal business activity of the community development segment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of the impact of the restatement on our cash flows 
current developments business developments in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
efforts to increase liquidity and to stabilize the company for future opportunities consumed much of our management time in

on december   we entered into agreements with haliimaile pineapple company  limited hpc  a closely held corporation 
the agreements provided for hpc to harvest the fruit in the ground and to begin growing and marketing maui gold pineapple 
hpc hired of the mpc employees whose employment with us ceased as of year end note to consolidated financial statements 
resort operations 
in december  we entered into agreements with third parties to operate and manage the kapalua villas and the kapalua adventures operations 
the agreements principally license the operators to use our trade names and trademarks for the respective operations  and lease the operating assets of the operations and commercial space within the kapalua resort to the new operators 
employee reductions 
in march  in an effort to reduce costs  we eliminated approximately employees from our workforce 
further workforce reductions as a result of outsourcing certain resort operations and elimination of the agriculture segment in december  resulted in a total reduction in our work force of approximately employees 
most of the employees from our kapalua villas and kapalua adventures operations were hired by the new third party operators  and  as mentioned above  of the employees from our agriculture segment were hired by hpc 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated year ended december  change in millions  except share amounts consolidated revenues loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss net loss per common share we reported a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million for for and  the net loss per common share was and  respectively 
at the end of  we ceased all of our agriculture segment operations and we are reporting that segment as discontinued operations 
our loss from continuing operations was million for and million for losses from our equity investment in bay holdings of million in and million in  impairment charges related to obsolete development plans  employee severance charges incurred as we downsized our operations  and operating losses from our resort operations caused by low visitor counts  were largely responsible for the losses in and consolidated revenues were million and million for and  respectively 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million compared to million for the major components of the difference in general and administrative expenses were as follows years ended december  change in millions salaries and wages employee incentives and stock compensation pension and other postretirement expense professional and other outside services loss on asset disposals employee severance expense other net total general and administrative salaries and wages and employee incentives and stock compensation were lower in compared to due to a reduction in size of our workforce in by approximately employees 
approximately positions were eliminated in the resort and community development segments and in corporate services in march in an effort to reduce costs  and most of the other headcount reductions took place in december with the cessation of our agriculture segment operations  and transfer of the kapalua villas  kapalua adventures  and kapalua security and shuttle operations to third party operators 
in addition  a wage reduction was implemented in march that affected nearly all employees and in the second half of  there were also significant workforce reductions in the agriculture segment and in corporate services 

table of contents the increase in pension and other postretirement benefits expense reflects the decrease in value of assets in our defined benefit pension plans combined with a reduction in the discount rate as of january  compared to january  the decrease in professional services and other services primarily reflects a reduction in use of outside consultants  in particular legal and a reduction in the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  section loss on asset disposal for includes million for the settlement payment and forfeiture of a deposit under which we were obligated to purchase certain real estate at the kapalua resort 
the loss on asset disposals reflects the write off of excess equipment used it the resort operations 
employee severance expense decreased in despite the significant increase in headcount reduction because the severance plan covering non bargaining unit salaried personnel was amended in to reduce severance benefits 
also  of the employees that we severed in december were hired by the companies assuming our agriculture and resort operations and were therefore not eligible for severance benefits 
general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with our management s evaluation of services provided to the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for in and   and  respectively  of interest was capitalized to construction projects 
interest expense for and include a credit charge of  and  respectively  representing the change in the estimated fair value of the swap agreements entered into in january note to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for and also include credits of  and  respectively  representing the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability that was bifurcated from our million convertible notes  and charges for interest accretion of  and  respectively for and  on the carrying value of the convertible note notes and to consolidated financial statements 
our effective interest rate on borrowings was for compared to for and average borrowings were about million less in compared to the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the difference in the net fair value credit adjustments and accretion charges for the convertible notes and swap agreements of  for compared to million for resort year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for resort segment revenues were million for or lower than the reduced operating loss for was primarily due to staffing reductions and other cost cutting measures taken in 
table of contents in  financial results for the resort segment were negatively affected as maui continued to experience a soft tourism market as visitor days deceased by from and the number of occupied rooms at the kapalua resort decreased by in compared to and per person expenditures declined by compared to results for were sharply affected by the decline in visitor counts due to the economic recession in the united states and elsewhere that resulted in inability or hesitation to travel and reduced airline passenger capacity to hawaii because of airline closures 
golf  retail and villas revenues from golf operations decreased by and paid rounds of golf decreased by approximately for compared to average green and cart fees decreased by approximately in compared to resort retail sales for were approximately lower than sales for  reflecting the lower number of occupied rooms and reduced daily expenditures per person 
revenues from the kapalua villas were approximately lower in compared to  reflecting a decrease in occupied rooms and a lower average room rate 
there were approximately fewer rooms available in  partially reflecting units under renovation under our kapalua gold program to upgrade and standardize the units in our rental program 
as of december   the operations of the kapalua villas and kapalua adventures were licensed to a third party and we are now receiving license fees for the use of our trademarks and trade names  rental income for use of administrative and housekeeping space at the kapalua resort  and resort fees per occupied night for access to certain recreational facilities at the kapalua resort 
minimum annual rents and license fees are approximately  and will be accounted for in the community development operating segment in community development year ended december  change in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the community development segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues from this operating segment were million for compared to million for increased revenues in were primarily from the sale of real estate inventories 
the operating loss from this segment in and largely reflects losses from our investment in bay holdings 
also in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for the write off of development plans and other project costs that have been abandoned or are not otherwise expected to be recoverable because of the delay of the start of construction of new development projects in the fourth quarter of caused by  among other things  the economic recession  a worsening credit market  reduced demand for real estate  and declining consumer confidence note to consolidated financial statements 
our equity in the losses of bay holdings was million in compared to million for which included a charge for million representing what we believed to be an other than temporary impairment of our investment in bay holdings at the end of in september  bay holdings recorded a million charge representing an impairment of the value of the residences at kapalua bay project 
we recorded losses from this joint venture of million in and 
table of contents stopped recording our share of bay holdings losses after our investment balance and other amounts advanced to bay holdings were reduced to zero  and the estimated remaining obligations to the joint venture were accrued 
in june  construction of the residences at kapalua bay project was substantially completed and bay holdings closed escrow on whole ownership units and fractional ownership units  and construction work was complete by the end of note to consolidated financial statements 
real estate sales real estate inventory sales in produced revenues of million and pre tax income of million 
the real estate sales included the sale of the last lot in honolua ridge phase ii and the sale of acres in two land sale transactions 
our honolua ridge phase ii subdivision consisted of agricultural zoned lots  which began selling in august in  we sold approximately acres of upcountry maui property in three land sales transactions and recognized revenues of million and pretax income of approximately million 
real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors see the risk factor entitled real estate investments are subject to numerous risks and we are negatively impacted by the downturn in the real estate market under risk factors in item a above 
results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends for this segment 
agriculture year ended december  change in millions loss from discontinued operations before income taxes on november   our board of directors authorized the cessation of all pineapple operations by december  our agriculture segment operating results and the loss on sale of the assets are reported as discontinued operations and prior period amounts are restated for comparability 
the loss from discontinued operations for includes net charges of million related to the sale or other disposition of the agriculture segment assets  employee severance and cancellation of contracts 
liquidity and capital resources debt position at december   our total debt  including capital leases  was million  a decrease of million from december  at december   we had million in cash and million in available lines of credit 
the decrease in outstanding borrowings in was due to proceeds of million from the march sale of the pgc being applied to partially repay our revolving line of credit with wells fargo and certain other lenders note to consolidated financial statements 
our cash outlook for the next twelve months and ability to continue to meet our financial covenants is highly dependent on selling certain real estate assets in a difficult market and raising new equity capital 
if we are unable to meet our financial covenants resulting in the borrowings becoming immediately due  we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay such outstanding borrowings 
in addition  we currently have a commitment to purchase the spa  beach club improvements and the sundry store the amenities from bay holdings at actual construction costs of approximately 
table of contents million 
we are in discussions with the other members of bay holdings to negotiate the terms of the purchase and sale agreement including the purchase price and payment terms  and are discussing whether we will even be required to purchase the amenities 
the other members of bay holdings are generally open to revisions to the purchase terms or relieving us from our commitment to purchase the amenities in return for our best efforts to continue to operate the amenities  however  final terms of the purchase of the amenities remain to be resolved with the other members and lenders of bay holdings 
in june  we announced that due to a lack of a title sponsor  we were unable to hold the ladies professional golf association lpga event that was scheduled for october 
this has resulted in a dispute with the lpga  which can be resolved by mediation and if necessary by binding arbitration 
by agreement between the parties  mediation has been suspended through october and we expect to pay  of which will be applied towards sponsorship of an event if the parties are able to structure a future event 
in addition  in september  m 
yamamura and sons  inc yamamura filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we materially breached the maui gold pineapple planting and fruit purchase agreement by not providing a planting schedule for and by asking yamamura to cease planting pineapple for us  and that we unilaterally restricted and impaired the value of yamamura s benefits under the agreement 
we are also subject to other commitments and contingencies that could negatively impact our future cash flows  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve our initiatives discussed below in order to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
in response to these circumstances  we are undertaking several financial and strategic initiatives to reduce cash commitments and generate cash flow from a variety of sources  including the sale of several real estate assets 
in december  we entered into agreements with third parties to assume the operation and management of the kapalua villas  the kapalua adventures activities and the security and shuttle operations for the kapalua resort 
we also discontinued operations of our agriculture segment as of december  and consummated agreements with an unrelated closely held company to continue growing and marketing our maui gold pineapple 
further  we have renegotiated real estate purchase and other agreements to eliminate approximately million of cash commitments net of cancellation fees into and later 
we have taken several other actions to reduce cash outflows including reducing our total number of employees from approximately at december  to at the end of  as well as other measures to reduce operating expenses 
we are also actively in the process of attempting to sell several selected real estate assets to provide additional liquidity and to further reduce debt 
in december  we filed a registration statement to initiate an equity financing transaction

all outstanding principal and accrued interest was scheduled to be due on november  in march  we sold the pgc for million note to consolidated financial statements  which was included in the collateral securing the line of credit agreement 
in consideration for release of the pgc from the collateral  million of the sales proceeds were applied to partially repay outstanding borrowings and the credit limit under this facility was reduced to million 
in conjunction with the pgc sale  we amended the line of credit agreement to extend the maturity date to march  and  accordingly  classified the remaining outstanding principal of million as a noncurrent liability at december  in the consolidated balance sheet

our fixed rate swap agreement terminated in january private placement of convertible notes on july   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  bearing interest per annum payable quarterly in cash in arrears beginning october  the financing resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million  after deducting the placement agent fee and approximately  in legal and accounting expenses relating to the financing 
the net proceeds from this financing were used to re pay million of debt under our revolving lines of credit with interest rates that floated with the prime rate and a million fixed rate term loan that matures in see note to our consolidated financial statements

further  if an adjustment to the conversion price would result in any investor owning in excess of i such investor s firpta cap as defined in the convertible notes on an as converted basis without regard for any limitations of conversion set forth in the convertible notes or ii the exchange cap allocation as defined in the convertible notes  then in lieu of the full anti dilution adjustment  the conversion price will be reduced to the conversion price that would result in such note being convertible into such number of shares of common stock equal to the lower of the investor s firpta cap or exchange cap allocation  as applicable without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth in the convertible note  and  in addition  no later than five business days following the date of conversion of the convertible note  such investor shall receive a cash payment from us equal to the product of x the closing bid price of our common stock on such conversion date and y the number of shares of common stock in excess of such firpta cap or exchange cap allocation  as applicable  that would have otherwise been issuable without regard to such limitation and any other limitations on conversion set forth in the convertible note 
the convertible notes mature on july  however  at any time after the second anniversary of the closing  we have the right  but not the obligation  to require the investors to convert their convertible notes into shares of our common stock at the then applicable conversion price if the average of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock is of the conversion price then in effect for out of consecutive trading days

the make whole premium table included in the convertible notes sets forth the number of additional shares to be paid depending upon the effective date of the change of control triggering the make whole premium payment and the price paid per share of common stock in the change of control 
additionally  the convertible notes may become immediately due and payable upon an event of default  as defined in the convertible notes 
if a convertible note is redeemed in connection with an event of default  we may be required to pay a redemption premium  in which case the redemption amount would equal multiplied by i the principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the convertible note  or ii the highest closing sale price of our common stock during the period between the event of default and delivery of redemption notice multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock into which a convertible note is then convertible
