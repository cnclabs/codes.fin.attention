item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview constellation energy group  inc constellation energy is an energy company that conducts its business through various subsidiaries and joint ventures including a merchant energy business and baltimore gas and electric company bge 
we describe our operating segments in note to consolidated financial statements 
this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the regulated business es are to bge 
we discuss our business in more detail in item business section and the risk factors affecting our business in item a 
risk factors section 
in this discussion and analysis  we will explain the general financial condition of and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including factors which affect our businesses  our earnings and costs in the periods presented  changes in earnings and costs between periods  sources of earnings  impact of these factors on our overall financial condition  expected sources of cash for future capital expenditures  our net available liquidity and collateral requirements  and expected future expenditures for capital projects 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income loss  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of our consolidated statements of income loss 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows first  we discuss our strategy 
then  we describe the business environment in which we operate including how recent events  regulation  weather  and other factors affect our business 
next  we discuss our critical accounting policies 
these are the accounting policies that are most important to both the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
we highlight significant events that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we review our results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results  followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment 
we review our financial condition addressing our sources and uses of cash  security ratings  capital resources  capital requirements  commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements 
we conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks 
strategy as a result of significant market events in  we previously disclosed plans to refocus and  in some cases  exit parts of our merchant energy business 
we also sought to increase available liquidity and reduce our business risk 
in addition  in november  we completed a transaction to sell to edf group and affiliates edf a interest in our nuclear generation and operation business 
this transaction brought us stability as a stand alone company as well as improved our liquidity 
we discuss the transaction with edf and our divestitures in note to consolidated financial statements and our available liquidity and risk management activities later in this item we are pursuing a strategy of owning and operating generation facilities  providing energy and energy related products and services through our customer supply activities  and delivering electricity and gas to customers of bge  our regulated utility located in central maryland 
our merchant energy business is focusing on short term and long term purchases and sales of energy  capacity  and related products to various customers  including distribution utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  and residential  industrial  commercial  and governmental customers 
we obtain this energy from both owned and contracted supply resources 
our generation fleet is strategically located in deregulated markets and includes various fuel types  such as coal  natural gas  oil  and renewable sources 
in addition to owning generating facilities  we contract for power from other merchant providers  typically through power purchase agreements 
we use both our owned generation and our contracted generation to support our wholesale and retail customer supply operations 
our merchant energy business actively manages our customer supply operations with both physical and contractual assets in order to derive incremental value 
the combination of our generation and customer supply operations allows us to manage our customer supply operations in a collateral efficient manner 
through our retail sales channels  we are able to manage our generation with lower requirements to post collateral 
additionally  when we use owned or contracted generation  we reduce our collateral posting requirements 
we have load obligations greater than our generation assets 
going forward  we intend to buy generation assets and enter into longer tenor agreements with merchant generators in regions where we currently serve load but do not have a significant generation presence 
we believe that by better matching generating assets with our load obligations  we will be able to further reduce our dependence on exchange traded products  thereby lowering our collateral requirements 
we believe that the proceeds received from the transaction with edf  along with overall market conditions  provide the resources and potential opportunities to add to our generation assets at attractive prices over the next two to three years 
at bge  we are also focused on enhancing reliability  customer satisfaction  and customer demand response initiatives 
customer choice  regulatory change  and energy market conditions significantly impact our business 
in response  we regularly evaluate our strategies with these goals in mind to improve our competitive position  to anticipate and adapt to the business environment and regulatory changes  and to maintain a 
table of contents strong balance sheet and investment grade credit quality through the use of a business model that applies cash flow to reduce debt 
while we pursue the above strategy with generation and customer supply activities  we are continuing a disciplined approach to the management of our collateral requirements and liquidity  including pricing new business to reflect the full cost of capital in the current economic environment  balancing operating cash flows with earnings growth  maintaining a liquidity cushion in excess of credit rating downgrade collateral requirements and market stress conditions  using proceeds from the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf to reduce our debt and maintain credit metrics consistent with investment grade ratings to support our customer supply operations  and focusing on constellation energy s core strengths of owning  developing  and operating generation assets  providing reliable  regulated utility service to customers  leveraging our expertise in managing physical risks inherent in our generation and customer supply operations  and maintaining strong supply relationships with retail and wholesale customers 
we are also in the forefront of the proposed development of new nuclear generation in the united states through our unistar nuclear energy une joint venture with edf 
edf brings operational experience  global scale  and procurement leverage to the development of new nuclear plants in the united states 
business environment various factors affect our financial results 
we discuss some of these factors in more detail in item business competition section 
we also discuss these various factors in the forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
throughout  volatility in the financial markets intensified  leading to dramatic declines in equity prices and substantially reducing liquidity in the credit markets 
most equity indices declined significantly  the cost of credit default swaps and bond spreads increased substantially  and credit markets effectively ceased to be accessible for all but the most highly rated borrowers 
in  markets in which we operate were affected by declining prices for power  gas  and capacity 
during  we improved our liquidity and reduced our business risk in response to these market events 
we discuss our liquidity and collateral requirements in the financial condition section 
we continue to actively manage our credit risk to attempt to reduce the impact of a potential counterparty default 
we discuss our customer counterparty credit and other risks in more detail in the risk management section 
competition impacts our business 
we discuss merchant competition in more detail in item business competition section 
the impacts of electric deregulation on bge in maryland are discussed in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business electric competition section 
regulation maryland maryland psc in addition to electric restructuring  which we discuss in item business electric competition section  regulation by the maryland public service commission maryland psc significantly influences bge s businesses 
the maryland psc determines the rates that bge can charge customers of its electric distribution and gas businesses 
the maryland psc incorporates into bge s standard offer service rates the transmission rates determined by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
bge s electric rates are unbundled in customer billings to show separate components for delivery service ie base rates  electric supply commodity charge and transmission  and certain taxes and surcharges 
the rates for bge s regulated gas business continue to consist of a delivery charge base rates as well as certain taxes and surcharges and a commodity charge 
order approving transaction with edf in october  the maryland psc issued an order approving our transaction with edf subject to the following conditions  with which both constellation energy and edf are complying constellation energy is to fund a one time per customer distribution rate credit for bge residential customers  before the end of march  totaling million  or approximately per customer  for which we recorded a liability and corresponding reduction in regulated electric and gas revenues in november in december  bge filed a tariff with the maryland psc stating we would give residential customers a rate credit of exactly per customer 
as a result  we accrued an additional million for a total fourth quarter accrual of million 
constellation energy made a million equity contribution to bge in december to fund the after tax amount of the rate credit as ordered by the maryland psc 
constellation energy is required to make a million cash capital contribution to bge by no later than june  constellation energy made this equity contribution to bge in december bge will not pay common dividends to constellation energy if after the dividend payment  bge s equity ratio would be below as calculated pursuant to the maryland psc s ratemaking precedents  or bge s senior unsecured credit rating is rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies below investment grade 
bge may file an electric and or gas distribution rate case at any time beginning in january and may not file a subsequent electric and or gas distribution rate case until january any rate increase in the first electric distribution rate case will be capped at as 
table of contents agreed to by constellation energy in its settlement with the state of maryland and the maryland psc 
bge plans to file an electric and gas distribution rate case in the second quarter of constellation energy will be limited to allocating no more than of its holding company costs to bge until the maryland psc reviews such cost allocations in the context of bge s next rate case 
constellation energy and bge are required to implement ring fencing measures designed to provide bankruptcy protection and credit rating separation of bge from constellation energy 
such measures include the formation of a new special purpose subsidiary by constellation energy to hold all of the common equity interests in bge 
we completed the implementation of these measures in february maryland settlement agreement in march  constellation energy  bge  and a constellation energy affiliate entered into a settlement agreement with the state of maryland  the maryland psc and certain state of maryland officials to resolve pending litigation and to settle other prior legal  regulatory  and legislative issues 
on april   the governor of maryland signed enabling legislation  which became effective on june  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement each party acknowledged that the agreements adopted in relating to maryland s electric restructuring law are final and binding and the maryland psc closed ongoing proceedings relating to the settlement 
bge provided its residential electric customers approximately million in the form of a one time per customer rate credit 
we recorded a reduction to electric revenues on our and bge s consolidated statements of income loss during the second quarter of and reduced customers bills by the amount of the credit between september and december bge customers are relieved of the potential future liability for decommissioning calvert cliffs unit and unit  scheduled to begin no earlier than and  respectively  and are no longer obligated to pay a total of million  in dollars adjusted for inflation  pursuant to the maryland psc order regarding the deregulation of electric generation 
bge will continue to collect the million annual nuclear decommissioning charge from all electric customers through and continue to rebate this amount to residential electric customers  as previously required by maryland senate bill  which was enacted in june bge resumed collection of the residential return portion of the administrative charge included in standard offer service sos rates  which had been eliminated under senate bill  on june  and will continue collection through may  without having to rebate it to all residential electric customers 
this will total approximately million over this period 
this charge will be suspended from june  through december  any increase in electric distribution revenue awarded in the first electric distribution rate case filed by bge after the settlement will be capped at with certain exceptions 
the agreement does not govern or affect our ability to recover costs associated with gas rates  federally approved transmission rates and charges  electric riders  tax increases  or increases associated with standard offer service power supply auctions 
effective june   bge implemented revised depreciation rates for regulatory and financial reporting purposes 
the revised rates reduced depreciation expense by approximately million in and million in without impacting distribution rates charged to customers 
effective june   maryland laws governing investments in companies that own and operate regulated gas and electric utilities were amended to make them less restrictive with respect to certain capital stock acquisition transactions 
constellation energy elected two independent directors to the board of directors of bge within the required six months from the execution of the settlement agreement 
senate bills and in june  maryland senate bill was enacted  which among other things imposed rate stabilization measures that i capped rate increases by bge for residential sos service at from july  to may   ii gave residential sos customers the option from june  until december  of paying a full market rate or choosing a short term rate stabilization plan in order to provide a smooth transition to market rates without adversely affecting the creditworthiness of bge  and iii provided for full market rates for all residential sos service starting january   and allowed bge to recover the costs deferred from july  to may  from its customers over a period not to exceed years  on terms and conditions to be determined by the maryland psc  including through the issuance of rate stabilization bonds that securitize the deferred costs 
in connection with these provisions of senate bill in may  the maryland psc approved a plan to allow residential electric customers to defer the transition to full market rates from june  to january  the percent of customers who chose to defer are repaying the deferred amounts without interest over a twenty one month period which began on april  in june  a subsidiary of bge issued an aggregate principal amount of million of rate stabilization bonds to recover costs relating to the residential rate deferral from july  to may  we discuss 
table of contents the rate stabilization bond issuance in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
in april  maryland senate bill was enacted  which made certain modifications to senate bill pursuant to senate bill  the maryland psc was required to initiate several studies  including studies relating to stranded costs  the costs and benefits of various options for re regulation  and the structure of the electric industry in maryland 
in december  the maryland psc issued an interim report addressing the costs and benefits of various options for re regulation and recommending actions to be taken to address an anticipated shortage of generation and transmission capacity in maryland  which included implementation of demand response initiatives and requiring utilities to enter into long term power purchase contracts with suppliers 
the maryland psc issued a final report in december in the final report  the maryland psc did not recommend returning the former utility generation assets to full cost of service regulation  but rather recommended incremental  forward looking re regulation when appropriate to ensure a reliable supply of electricity or to obtain economic benefits for customers 
in  the maryland psc continued to examine how to procure electric supply for maryland residents  from modifications to the existing auction process to requiring that new generation be built by the utilities or by third parties 
we cannot at this time predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries  studies  and recommendations or their actual effect on our  or bge s financial results  but it could be material 
we discuss the market risk of our regulated electric business in more detail in the risk management section 
base rates base rates are the rates the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them delivery service  plus a profit 
bge has both electric base rates and gas base rates 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time  subject to limitations in the maryland psc s october order approving our transaction with edf 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover its utility plant investment and operating costs  plus a profit 
generally  rate increases improve the earnings of our regulated business because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
bge s most recently approved return on electric distribution rate base was approved in 
bge s most recently approved return on gas rate base was approved in 
revenue decoupling the maryland psc has allowed us to record a monthly adjustment to our electric distribution revenues from residential and small commercial customers since and for the majority of our large commercial and industrial customers since february to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on our electric distribution volumes  thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenues per customer  by customer class  regardless of changes in consumption levels 
this means bge recognizes revenues at maryland psc approved levels per customer  regardless of what actual distribution volumes were for a billing period 
therefore  while these revenues are affected by customer growth  they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions 
we then bill or credit impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings 
we have a similar revenue decoupling mechanism in our gas business 
demand response and advanced metering programs in order to implement an advanced metering pilot program and a demand response program  bge defers costs associated with these programs as a regulatory asset and recovers these costs from customers in future periods 
we discuss the advanced metering and demand response programs in more detail in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric load management 
electric commodity and transmission charges we discuss bge electric commodity and transmission charges standard offer service  including the impact of the enactment of senate bill in maryland  in the business environment regulation maryland senate bills and section 
gas commodity charge bge charges its gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase 
the price bge charges for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates in more detail in the regulated gas business gas cost adjustments section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
federal regulation ferc the ferc has jurisdiction over various aspects of our business  including electric transmission and wholesale natural gas and electricity sales 
bge transmission rates are updated annually based on a formula methodology approved by ferc 
the rates also include transmission investment incentives approved by ferc in a number of orders covering various new transmission investment projects since we believe that ferc s continued commitment to fair and efficient wholesale energy markets should continue to result in improvements to competitive markets across various regions 
since  operation of bge s transmission system has been under the authority of pjm interconnection pjm  the regional transmission organization rto for the mid atlantic region  pursuant to ferc oversight 
as the transmission operator  pjm administers the energy markets and conducts day to day operations of the bulk power system 
the liability of transmission owners  including bge  and power generators is limited to those damages caused by the gross negligence of such entities 

table of contents in addition to pjm  rtos exist in other regions of the country such as the midwest  new york  and new england 
similar to pjm  these rtos also administer the energy market for their region and are responsible for operation of the transmission system and transmission system reliability 
our merchant energy business participates in these regional energy markets 
these markets are continuing to develop  and revisions to market structure are subject to review and approval by ferc 
we cannot predict the outcome of any reviews at this time 
however  changes to the structure of these markets could have a material effect on our financial results 
ferc initiatives ongoing initiatives at ferc have included a review of its methodology for the granting of market based rate authority to sellers of electricity 
ferc has established interim tests that it uses to determine the extent to which companies may have market power in certain regions 
where ferc finds that market power exists  it may require companies to implement measures to mitigate the market power in order to maintain market based rate authority 
we believe that our entities selling wholesale power continue to satisfy ferc s test for determining whether to grant a public utility market based rate authority 
in november  ferc eliminated through and out transmission rates between the midwest independent system operator miso and pjm and put in place seams elimination charge cost adjustment assignment seca transition rates  which are paid by the transmission customers of miso and pjm and allocated among the various transmission owners in pjm and miso 
the seca transition rates were in effect from december  through march  ferc set for hearing the various compliance filings that established the level of the seca rates and has indicated that the seca rates are being recovered from the miso and pjm transmission customers subject to refund by the miso and pjm transmission owners 
we are a recipient of seca payments  payer of seca charges  and supplier to whom such charges may be shifted 
administrative hearings regarding the seca charges concluded in may  and an initial decision from the ferc administrative law judge alj was issued in august the decision of the alj generally found in favor of reducing the overall seca liability 
the decision  if upheld  is expected to significantly reduce the overall seca liability at issue in this proceeding 
however  the alj also allowed seca charges to be shifted to upstream suppliers  subject to certain adjustments 
therefore  certain charges could be shifted to our global commodities operation 
ferc has stated that it would issue a substantive order on the alj s decision no later than the end of may nonetheless  the amounts collected under the seca rates are subject to refund and the ultimate outcome of the proceeding establishing seca rates is uncertain 
depending on the ultimate outcome  the proceeding may have a material effect on our financial results 
capacity markets in general  capacity market design revisions are routinely proposed and considered on an ongoing basis 
such changes are subject to ferc s review and approval 
currently  we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the possible effect on our  or bge s  financial results 
through and  pjm made several filings at ferc proposing various revisions to its capacity market  or reliability pricing model rpm  including the determination of the cost of new entry cone  which is an important component in determining the price paid to capacity resources in pjm 
pjm also proposed revisions relating to the participation of energy efficiency and demand resources  and market power and mitigation rules 
some of these matters are still pending at ferc 
while recent rpm design changes have not yet had a material effect on our financial results  we cannot predict the outcome of the issues still pending or on any capacity market design changes that result from new regulatory requirements 
such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
in may  five state public service commissions  including the maryland psc  consumer advocates  and others filed a complaint against pjm at the ferc  alleging that the rpm produced unreasonable prices during the period from june  through may  the complaint requests that ferc establish a refund effective date of june   reject the results of the through rpm capacity auction results  and significantly reduce prices for capacity beginning as of june  through in september  ferc dismissed the complaint and in october  the complainants requested a rehearing at ferc 
ferc denied rehearing and ultimately the case was appealed and is pending before the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the amount of refunds that may be owed by or due to us  if any 
however  the outcome  and any refunds that are ultimately assessed  could have a material impact on our financial results 
in april  the attorney general of connecticut  the connecticut department of public utilities and office of consumer counsel together  the connecticut parties filed complaints at ferc alleging improper energy bidding behavior since december  by generators located in new york that also received capacity payments within iso new england 
in may  the connecticut parties filed an amended complaint asserting that constellation energy commodities group  inc ccg and others received capacity payments while never intending to perform as capacity resources 
the revised allegations assert that certain generators engaged in economic withholding by submitting energy bids at or near the offer cap 
since december  ccg has received approximately million in payments for capacity offered into iso new england associated with constellation energy s nuclear facilities located in ny 
in august  ferc issued an order setting this matter for a public hearing before an alj to determine the intent of the capacity suppliers including ccg in making their energy offers in iso new england 
ccg is participating in the administrative hearing  which is ongoing and has maintained its 
table of contents adherence to all applicable rules and regulations relating to the market activity 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of the ferc hearing or any potential liability that ccg may incur 
three major  high voltage transmission lines have been announced that could enhance significantly the transfer capacity of the pjm transmission system from west to east 
the siting process  both in the states and at ferc  is uncertain  as is the likelihood that one or more of the transmission lines will be ultimately constructed 
the construction of the transmission lines  which could depress both capacity and energy prices for generation located in maryland and elsewhere in the eastern part of pjm  could have a material effect on our financial results 
nerc reliability standards in compliance with the energy policy act of  ferc has approved the north american electric reliability corporation nerc as the national energy reliability organization 
nerc will be responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability and cyber security standards for the wholesale electric power system 
we are responsible for complying with the standards in the regions in which we operate 
nerc will have the ability to assess financial penalties for noncompliance  which could be material 
given the increasing concern over the security of the country s energy infrastructure  there could be future rules or regulations related to the operation and security requirements of our generating facilities and electric and gas transmission and distribution systems  which could have a material impact on our operations and financial results 
commodity futures trading commission the united states congress and the commodity futures trading commission cftc are evaluating additional laws and regulations for the derivatives markets  including position limits and eliminating regulatory exemptions for hedging activity 
we are unable to determine the final form any regulations or new laws may take  but such laws or regulations could have a material effect on our business 
market oversight regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction over our businesses  including the ferc and cftc  possess broad enforcement and investigative authority to ensure well functioning markets and to prohibit market manipulation or violations of the agencies rules or orders 
these agencies also possess significant civil penalty authority  including in the case of ferc and the cftc  the authority to impose a penalty of up to million per day per violation 
we are committed to a culture of compliance and ensuring compliance with all applicable rules  laws and orders 
nonetheless  the regulatory agencies engage in either public or non public investigations in response to allegations of wrongdoing and we may be involved in certain market activities that become subject to investigations 
even where no wrongdoing is found  the process of participating in a regulatory investigation could have a material effect on our business 
weather merchant energy business weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our merchant energy business 
weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity  natural gas  and fuels 
changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market  which may affect our results in any given period 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
the demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time  thus we are not typically exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of our business at once 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
weather affects residential sales more than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
the maryland psc has approved revenue decoupling mechanisms which allow bge to record monthly adjustments to the majority of our regulated electric and gas business distribution revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns 
we discuss this further in the regulation maryland psc revenue decoupling  regulated electric business revenue decoupling and regulated gas business revenue decoupling sections 
other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our merchant energy business 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  number of market participants  extreme peak demands  available supply resources  transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  implementation of new market rules governing operations of regional power pools  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and international supply and demand 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  
table of contents market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  local transportation systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
other factors also impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downturn  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental matters and legal proceedings we discuss details of our environmental matters in note to consolidated financial statements and item business environmental matters section 
we discuss details of our legal proceedings in note to consolidated financial statements 
some of this information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards adopted and issued we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income loss  our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities we utilize a variety of derivative instruments in order to manage commodity price risk  interest rate risk  and foreign currency risk 
because of the extensive nature of the accounting requirements that govern both accounting treatment and documentation  as well as the complexity of the transactions within its scope  management is required to exercise judgment in several areas  including the following identification of derivatives  selection of accounting treatment for derivatives  valuation of derivatives  and impact of uncertainty 
as discussed in more detail below  the exercise of management s judgment in these areas materially impacts our financial statements 
while we believe we have appropriate controls in place to apply the derivative accounting requirements  failure to meet these requirements  even inadvertently  could require the use of a different accounting treatment for the affected transactions 
in addition  interpretations of these accounting requirements continue to evolve  and future changes in accounting requirements also could affect our financial statements materially 
we discuss derivatives and hedging activities in more detail in note and note to consolidated financial statements 
identification of derivatives we must evaluate new and existing transactions and agreements to determine whether they are derivatives 
identifying derivatives requires us to exercise judgment in interpreting the definition of a derivative and applying that definition to each individual contract 
if a contract is not a derivative  we cannot apply derivative accounting  and we generally must record the effects of the contract in our financial statements upon delivery or settlement under the accrual method of accounting 
in contrast  if a contract is a derivative  we must apply derivative accounting  which provides for several possible accounting treatments as discussed more fully under accounting treatment below 
as a result  the required accounting treatment and its impact on our financial statements can vary substantially depending upon whether a contract is a derivative or a non derivative 
accounting treatment we are permitted several possible accounting treatments for derivatives that meet all of the applicable requirements 
mark to market is the default accounting treatment for all derivatives unless they qualify  and we affirmatively designate them  for one of the other accounting treatments 
derivatives designated for any of the other elective accounting treatments 
table of contents must meet specific  restrictive criteria  both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis 
the permissible accounting treatments for derivatives are mark to market  cash flow hedge  fair value hedge  and accrual accounting under normal purchase normal sale npns 
each of the accounting treatments that we use for derivatives affects our financial statements in substantially different ways as summarized below recognition and measurement accounting treatment balance sheet income statement mark to market derivative asset or liability recorded at fair value changes in fair value recognized in earnings cash flow hedge derivative asset or liability recorded at fair value effective changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ineffective changes in fair value recognized in earnings amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings or becomes probable of not occurring fair value hedge derivative asset or liability recorded at fair value book value of hedged asset or liability adjusted for changes in its fair value changes in fair value recognized in earnings changes in fair value of hedged asset or liability recognized in earnings npns accrual fair value not recorded accounts receivable or accounts payable recorded when derivative settles changes in fair value not recognized in earnings revenue or expense recognized in earnings when underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed we exercise judgment in determining which derivatives qualify for a particular accounting treatment  including cash flow and fair value hedges determination that all hedge accounting requirements are satisfied  including the expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair value from the risk being hedged and  for cash flow hedges  the probability that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur 
accrual accounting under npns determination that the derivative will result in gross physical delivery of the underlying commodity and will not settle net 
we also exercise judgment in selecting the accounting treatment that we believe provides the most transparent presentation of the economics of the underlying transactions 
although contracts may be eligible for hedge accounting or npns designation  we are not required to designate and account for all such contracts identically 
we generally elect accrual or hedge accounting for our physical energy delivery activities generation and customer supply because accrual accounting more closely aligns the timing of earnings recognition  cash flows  and the underlying business activities 
by contrast  we generally apply mark to market accounting for risk management and trading activities because changes in fair value more closely reflect the economic performance of the activity 
however  we also use mark to market accounting for the following physical energy delivery activities our nonregulated retail gas customer supply activities  which are managed using economic hedges that we have not designated as cash flow hedges so as to match the timing of recognition of the earnings impacts of those activities to the greatest extent permissible  and economic hedges of activities that require accrual accounting for which the related hedge requires mark to market accounting 

table of contents as a result of making these judgments  the selection of accounting treatments for derivatives has a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
these impacts affect several components of our financial statements  including assets  liabilities  and accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
additionally  the selection of accounting treatment also affects the amount and timing of the recognition of earnings 
the following table summarizes these impacts accounting treatment effect of changes in fair value on mark to market cash flow hedge fair value hedge npns assets and liabilities increase or decrease in derivatives increase or decrease in derivatives increase or decrease in derivatives decrease or increase in hedged asset or liability no impact aoci no impact increase or decrease for effective portion of hedge no impact no impact earnings prior to settlement increase or decrease increase or decrease for ineffective portion of hedge increase or decrease for change in derivatives decrease or increase for change in hedged asset or liability increase or decrease for ineffective portion no impact earnings at settlement no impact amounts in aoci reclassified to earnings when hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings or when the forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring hedged margin recognized in earnings revenue or expense recognized in earnings when underlying physical commodity is sold or consumed valuation we record mark to market and hedge derivatives at fair value  which represents an exit price for the asset or liability from the perspective of a market participant 
an exit price is the price at which a market participant could sell an asset or transfer a liability to an unrelated party 
while some of our derivatives relate to commodities or instruments for which quoted market prices are available from external sources  many other commodities and related contracts are not actively traded 
additionally  some contracts include quantities and other factors that vary over time 
in these cases  we must use modeling techniques to estimate expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both in order to determine fair value 
the prices  quantities  and other factors we use to determine fair value reflect management s best estimates of inputs a market participant would consider 
we record valuation adjustments to reflect uncertainties associated with estimates inherent in the determination of fair value that are not incorporated in market price information or other market based estimates we use to determine fair value 
to the extent possible  we utilize market based data together with quantitative methods for both measuring the uncertainties for which we record valuation adjustments and determining the level of such adjustments and changes in those levels 
we discuss fair value measurements in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the judgments we are required to make in order to estimate fair value have a material impact on our financial statements 
these judgments affect the selection  appropriateness  and application of modeling techniques  the methods used to identify or estimate inputs to the modeling techniques  and the consistency in applying these techniques over time and across types of derivative instruments 
changes in one or more of these judgments could have a material impact on the valuation of derivatives and  as a result  could also have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
impacts of uncertainty the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities involves significant judgment and requires the use of estimates that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported amounts of revenues and costs and could be 
table of contents affected by many factors including  but not limited to  the following uncertainty surrounding inputs to the estimates of fair value due to factors such as illiquid markets or the absence of observable market price information  our ability to continue to designate and qualify derivative contracts for npns accounting or hedge accounting  potential volatility in earnings from ineffectiveness on derivatives for which we have elected hedge accounting  and our ability to enter into new mark to market derivative origination transactions 
evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value long lived assets we are required to evaluate certain assets that have long lives for example  generating property and equipment and real estate to determine if they are impaired when certain conditions exist 
we are required to test our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes are a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition  an adverse action by a regulator or legislature or an adverse change in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for long lived assets classified as held for sale  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent their carrying amount exceeds their fair value less costs to sell 
for long lived assets that we expect to hold and use  we recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
this necessarily requires us to estimate uncertain future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our earnings forecasts 
if we are considering alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset such as the potential sale of an asset  we probability weight the alternative courses of action to estimate the cash flows 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
the estimation of fair value also involves judgment 
we consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
often  we will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as discussed above with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
gas properties we evaluate unproved property at least annually to determine if it is impaired 
impairment for unproved property occurs if there are no firm plans to continue drilling  the lease is near its expiration  or historical experience necessitates a valuation allowance 
investments we evaluate our equity method and cost method investments for example  ceng  une  cep and partnerships that own power projects to determine whether or not they are impaired 
the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded is whether the investment has experienced an other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of investment impairments involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subject to variation  and the impact of such variations could be material 
additionally  if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment  we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value 

table of contents we continuously monitor issues that potentially could impact future profitability of our equity method investments that own geothermal  coal  hydroelectric  fuel processing projects  as well as our equity investments in our nuclear joint ventures and cep 
these issues include environmental and legislative initiatives as well as events that will impact the viability of new nuclear development 
we discuss certain risks and uncertainties in more detail in our forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
however  should future events cause these investments to become uneconomic  our investments in these projects could become impaired 
current california statutes and regulations require load serving entities to increase their procurement of renewable energy resources and mandate statewide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
given the need for electric power and the statutory and regulatory requirements increasing demand for renewable resource technologies  we believe california will continue to foster an environment that supports the use of renewable energy and continues certain subsidies that will make renewable energy projects economical 
however  should california legislation and regulatory policies and federal energy policies fail to adequately support renewable energy initiatives  our equity method investments in these types of projects could become impaired  and any losses recognized could be material 
debt and equity securities our available for sale investments in debt and equity securities are subject to impairment evaluations 
our most significant available for sale securities were the nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets 
however  upon the completion of our transaction with edf on november   we no longer reflect the nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent that ceng impairs its nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets  we will report our share of the impairment as part of our equity investment earnings in ceng 
we determine whether a decline in fair value of an investment below book value is other than temporary 
if we determine that the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment must be written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
for securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund through november  for which the market value was below book value  the decline in fair value for these securities was considered other than temporary  and the securities were written down to fair value 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the business might be impaired 
goodwill is impaired if the carrying value of the business exceeds fair value 
annually  we estimate the fair value of the businesses we have acquired using techniques similar to those used to estimate future cash flows for long lived assets as discussed on the previous page  which involves judgment 
if the estimated fair value of the business is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is greater than its fair value 
significant events sale of membership interest in ceng to edf on november   we sold a membership interest in ceng  our nuclear generation and operation business 
the following summarizes where we disclose the significant impacts of this transaction on us we provide an overview of this transaction in item business section 
upon the close of this transaction  we deconsolidated ceng and recorded our initial investment in ceng on our consolidated balance sheets 
we discuss the significant changes as a result of recording the transaction and the deconsolidation of ceng on our consolidated balance sheets and the expected impact on our ongoing financial results and cash flows in this section 
as a result of recording the transaction  we have presented certain additional line items on our consolidated financial statements in item  such as our investment in ceng  the gain on sale  and the proceeds received from the transaction 
we recorded a significant gain on the sale of the membership interest as well as on our retained interest at transaction close 
the fair value of our investment in ceng exceeded our share of ceng s equity because ceng s assets and liabilities retained their historical carrying value 
this basis difference will be amortized as a reduction to our future equity in earnings of ceng 
we discuss this item in notes and to consolidated financial statements 
we discuss the maryland psc order approving the transaction in note to consolidated financial statements 
the closing of the transaction impacted our credit facilities and  therefore  our net available liquidity

we discuss our debt retirements to date in note to consolidated financial statements 
given the significance of our investment in ceng  we are exposed to many of the same risks as ceng 
ceng is exposed to risks associated with operating nuclear generating facilities and the risk of a nuclear accident 
we discuss our exposure to certain of these risks in note to consolidated financial statements 
we entered into the following agreements with ceng a power purchase agreement  a power services agency agreement  and an administrative services agreement

results of operations in this section  we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments 
significant changes in other income expense  fixed charges  and income taxes are discussed in the aggregate for all segments in the consolidated nonoperating income and expenses section 
as discussed in item business overview section and in the strategy and significant events sections  constellation energy s and operating results were materially impacted by a number of significant events  transactions  and changes in our strategic direction

table of contents merchant energy business background our merchant energy business is a competitive provider of energy solutions for various customers 
we discuss the impact of deregulation on our merchant energy business in item business competition section 
our merchant energy business focuses on delivery of physical  customer oriented products to producers and consumers  manages the risk and optimizes the value of our owned generation assets and customer supply activities  and uses our portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy limited risk capital 
at the beginning of  we outlined various strategic initiatives to reduce risk for our global commodities operation 
as of december   these initiatives have been completed 
we discuss our current strategy in more detail in the strategy section 
the execution of our strategy in the future may be affected by instability in financial  credit  and commodities markets 
execution of our goals could have a substantial effect on the nature and mix of our business activities 
we record merchant energy revenues and expenses in our financial results in different periods depending upon which portion of our business they affect and based on the associated accounting policies 
we discuss our revenue recognition policies in the critical accounting policies section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
our global commodities operation transacts in energy and energy related commodities in order to manage our portfolio of energy purchases and sales to customers through structured transactions 
as part of these activities  we trade energy and energy related commodities and deploy limited risk capital in the management of our portfolio in order to earn returns 
we discuss the impact of our trading activities and economic value at risk in more detail in the mark to market and risk management sections

the impairment losses and other costs and workforce reduction costs line items also include amounts related to the operations we divested 

table of contents effects of transaction with edf on statement of income loss prior to november   ceng was a owned subsidiary  and we consolidated its financial results within our consolidated statements of income loss 
on november   we completed the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf  and we deconsolidated ceng 
accordingly  for the period from november  through december   we ceased recording ceng s financial results and began to record equity investment earnings from ceng as well as the effect of our ppa and other transactions with ceng 
we discuss our transaction with edf in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
for the period from january  through november   our merchant energy results included the following financial results of ceng for the period from january  through november  in billions revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses operating expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations as a result of deconsolidation  we expect that our future merchant energy results will differ from historical results primarily due to the following factors revenues we will sell between of the output of ceng s plants  excluding output sold by ceng directly to third parties  rather than of the plants total output including volumes contracted to third parties 
fuel and purchased energy expenses we will not include nuclear fuel expense but instead will reflect our purchase of between of the output of ceng s plants  excluding output sold directly to third parties  as provided under the terms of the ppa with ceng 
operating expenses we will no longer include ceng s plant operating costs or general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense we will no longer include deprecation of ceng s nuclear plants 
additionally  we will record our share of ceng s financial results and amortization of the ceng basis difference in the equity investment losses earnings line in our consolidated statements of income loss 
we discuss the accounting for our retained investment in ceng in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses our merchant energy business manages the revenues we realize from the sale of energy and energy related products to our customers and our costs of procuring fuel and energy 
the difference between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses  including all direct expenses  represents the gross margin of our merchant energy business  and this measure is a useful tool for assessing the profitability of our merchant energy business 
accordingly  we believe it is appropriate to discuss the operating results of our merchant energy business by analyzing the changes in gross margin between periods 
in managing our portfolio  we may terminate  restructure  or acquire contracts 
such transactions are within the normal course of managing our portfolio and may materially impact the timing of our recognition of revenues  fuel and purchased energy expenses  and cash flows 
in the third quarter of  we changed the management of the wholesale procurement function for retail gas activities from our customer supply operations to our global commodities operation 
in connection with this change  we began to prospectively account for the underlying retail gas contracts as derivative contracts subject to mark to market accounting  under which changes in fair value are recorded in revenues as they occur 
this activity was previously accounted for on a gross basis and recorded in accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses 
the change to mark to market accounting for this activity reduced both our accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses in and however  the change had a minimal impact on gross margin 
we discuss our merchant energy revenues  fuel and purchased energy expenses  and gross margin below 
revenues our merchant energy revenues decreased  million in compared to and decreased  million in compared to primarily due to the following vs 
vs

 substantially all due to change in gas procurement activities total decrease in merchant energy fuel and purchased energy expenses gross margin we analyze our merchant energy gross margin in the following categories 
generation our operation that owns  operates  and maintains fossil  nuclear through november   and renewable generating facilities and holds indirect interests in nuclear generating facilities since november   qualifying facilities  and power projects in the united states 
we present the gross margin results of this operation based on a hedged assumption for the portfolio  related to both output from the facilities and the fuel used to generate electricity 
the assumption is based on executing hedges at current market prices with the global commodities operation at the end of each prior fiscal year in order to ensure that the generation operation is fully hedged 
therefore  all commodity price risk is managed by and presented in the results of our global commodities operation as discussed below 
changes in gross margin of our generation operation during the period are due to changes in the level of output from the generating assets  and changes in gross margin between years are a result of changes in prices and expected output 
gross margin excludes our equity investment earnings from our nuclear joint ventures  qualifying facilities  and power projects 
we discuss our treatment of equity investment earnings in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
customer supply our load serving operation that provides energy products and services to wholesale and retail electric and natural gas customers  including distribution utilities  cooperatives  aggregators  and commercial  industrial and governmental customers 
we present the gross margin results of this operation based on the gross margin value of new customer supply arrangements at the time of execution assuming an estimated level of customer usage and the impact of any changes in the underlying usage of the customers based on actual energy deliveries including decreased demand related to the current economic environment 
changes in estimated customer usage result from attrition customers changing suppliers or variable load risk changes in actual usage when compared to expected usage 
all commodity price risk is presented in and managed by our global commodities operation 
global commodities our marketing  risk management  and trading operation that manages contractually owned physical assets  including generation facilities and natural gas properties  provides risk management services  and trades energy and energy related commodities 
this operation provides the wholesale risk management function for our generation and customer supply operations  as well as our structured products and energy investments portfolios  and includes our merchant energy business actual hedged positions with third parties 
therefore  changes in gross margin for this operation result mostly from changes in commodity prices and positions across the various commodities and regions in which we transact 
we provide a summary of our gross margin for these three components of our merchant energy business as follows dollar amounts in millions of total of total of total gross margin generation customer supply global commodities total generation the million increase in generation gross margin in compared to is primarily due to the following million increase from higher energy prices for the output of our generating assets in the pjm and new york regions based on prices established at the end of see global commodities discussion below for impact of price changes during  and million due to the timing and duration of planned and unplanned outages at our generating plants 

table of contents these increases were partially offset by the following million of lower gross margin on our nuclear fleet as a result of the deconsolidation of ceng following the sale of a membership interest to edf on november   and million of lower gross margin primarily related to our investments in power projects 
the million increase in generation gross margin in compared to is primarily due to the following million increase from higher energy prices for the output of our generating assets in the pjm and new york regions based on prices established at the end of see global commodities discussion below for impact of price changes during  and million of higher earnings for lower planned and unplanned outages at our nuclear and fossil plants 
in  our gross margin for generation will be lower than in as a result of the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf on november  customer supply the million increase in customer supply gross margin in compared to is primarily due to the following million of higher gross margin mostly related to the consolidation of a retail power supply variable interest entity for which we became the primary beneficiary in december and consolidated  and million of higher mark to market results primarily in our retail gas operation 
we discuss these results in more detail in the mark to market section 
these increases were partially offset by the following million of lower gross margin as a result of fewer customers and unfavorable variable load risk associated with wholesale and retail power primarily due to variances from normal weather and lower demand resulting from the economic downturn and our efforts to reduce risk in the business  and million related to lower realization of contracts executed in prior periods and lower volumes in our wholesale and retail power supply operations  partially offset by higher margins on new business originated and realized during the million decrease in customer supply gross margin in compared to is primarily due to the following million of lower gross margin related to unfavorable price movements and lower volumes in our retail power operation  million of lower gross margin related to lower realization of contracts executed in prior periods and lower new business originated and realized during the year at our wholesale power operation  and million of lower mark to market results in our retail gas operation 
we discuss this in more detail in the mark to market section 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of higher gross margin related to our retail gas operation primarily due to the acquisition of cornerstone energy on july  global commodities we analyze global commodities results in the following categories portfolio management and trading our centralized risk management service related to energy price risk associated with our generation fleet  wholesale and retail customer supply business  and our structured products portfolio 
structured products customized risk management products in the power  gas  coal and freight markets eg  generation tolls  gas transport and storage  and global coal and freight logistics 
during  we reduced our participation in the coal  freight and gas trading markets through the divestiture of our international coal and freight and our natural gas trading businesses 
energy investments investments in energy assets that primarily include natural gas properties and a joint interest in an entity that owns dry bulk cargo vessels 
we sold our interest in the entity that owns dry bulk cargo vessels during the million decrease in gross margin from our global commodities operation during compared to the same period of is primarily due to million of lower gross margin from our energy investments operation primarily related to lower business realized on our upstream gas activities within  and million of lower gross margin in our structured products portfolio primarily as a result of fewer transactions during these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in our portfolio management and trading operation 
these changes are discussed further in the table below 
as previously discussed  the energy markets were affected by substantial volatility in commodity prices during these market impacts are reflected in the million decrease in gross margin from our global commodities operation during compared to the same period of primarily due to million of lower gross margin in our portfolio management and trading activities  which are discussed further in the table below 
this is partially offset by million from gains in our structured products portfolio  consisting of approximately million as a result of the termination and sale of in the money energy purchase contracts  coal supply contracts  and freight contracts to eliminate or reduce operation and performance risk with certain counterparties  and approximately million related to higher realization of contracts executed in prior periods  and million in our energy investments operation primarily due to higher realization of contracts executed in prior periods 

table of contents our portfolio management and trading operation gross margin increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to primarily due to the following vs 
vs 
in millions change in portfolio management of positions arising from hedges of accrual positions with generation and customer supply activities due to the impact of changes in prices of power  natural gas  and coal change in gains recognized on hedges due to ineffectiveness and certain cash flow hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting change primarily due to write downs of our emission allowance inventory recorded in that did not recur at the same level in change in earnings related to our portfolio of contracts subject to mark to market accounting 
we discuss these results in more detail in the mark to market section below 
decrease due to loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings in connection with the closing of the sale of our international commodities operation as a result of hedged transactions that were probable of not occurring by the end of the specified contract period 
discontinuation of cash flow hedge accounting for derivative contracts within our international commodities operation increase due to the absence of our international coal and freight operations  which were divested in march  and assignment of certain contracts in change due to the absence of a loss as a result of the bankruptcy of one of our domestic coal suppliers 
during the first quarter of  as a result of a default by the supplier  we terminated our derivative contracts with the supplier  reclassified the related asset to accounts receivable and fully reserved the amount 
total change in portfolio management and trading gross margin mark to market mark to market results include net gains and losses from origination  risk management  and trading activities for which we use the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss these activities and the mark to market method of accounting in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature of our operations and the use of mark to market accounting for certain activities create fluctuations in mark to market earnings 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the impact on our earnings could be material 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the risk management section 
the primary factors that cause fluctuations in our mark to market results are changes in the level and volatility of forward commodity prices and interest rates  counterparty creditworthiness  the number and size of our open derivative positions  and the number  size  and profitability of new transactions  including termination or restructuring of existing contracts 
during  we focused our activities on reducing capital requirements  reducing long term economic risk  and reducing short and interim term liquidity requirements 
these actions may impact the future results of the merchant energy business  particularly the size of and potential for changes in fair value of activities subject to mark to market accounting 
the primary components of mark to market results are origination gains and gains and losses from risk management and trading activities 
origination gains arise primarily from contracts that our global commodities operation structures to meet the risk management needs of our customers or relate to our trading activities 
transactions that result in origination gains may be unique and provide the potential for individually significant revenues and gains from a single transaction 
risk management and trading mark to market represents both realized and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the value of our portfolio  including the effects of changes in valuation adjustments 
in addition to our fundamental risk management and trading activities  we also use non trading derivative contracts subject to mark to market accounting to manage our exposure to changes in market prices  while in general the underlying physical transactions related to these activities are accounted for on an accrual basis 
we discuss the changes in mark to market results below 
we show the relationship between our mark to market results and the change in our net mark to market energy asset later in this section 
mark to market results were as follows in millions unrealized mark to market results origination gains risk management and trading mark to market unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total risk management and trading mark to market total unrealized mark to market realized mark to market total mark to market results total unrealized mark to market is the sum of origination transactions and total risk management and trading mark to market 
includes gains losses on hedge ineffectiveness for fair value hedges recorded in gross margin 

table of contents total mark to market results decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of the period to period variance in unrealized changes in fair value was due to decreased unrealized risk management and trading results of million and the decrease in origination gains of million 
we discuss the decrease in origination gains below 
the decrease in risk management and trading results of million was primarily due to million of lower results in our domestic coal portfolio primarily as a result of less favorable price movements relating to economic hedges which substantially decreased in value as coal prices decreased in  million of lower gains in our international coal and freight operation as a result of its divestiture in march million of lower gains in our wholesale natural gas risk management and trading operation primarily as a result of the divestiture of our natural gas trading operation in the beginning of april  and million of lower results related to our emissions trading activities primarily as a result of a less favorable price environment 
these decreases were partially offset by the following million of higher results on open positions primarily due to the absence of losses in our power and transmission risk management activities primarily in the pjm  northeast  and new york regions as a result of a more favorable price environment in and our activities to reduce risk and improve liquidity  and million of lower losses in our retail gas portfolio primarily due to a more favorable price environment in total mark to market results decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of primarily due to unrealized changes in fair value 
the period to period variance in unrealized changes in fair value was due to lower gains from unrealized changes in fair value of million from risk management and trading  partially offset by an increase in origination gains of million 
we discuss the increase in origination gains below 
the net decrease in risk management and trading gains of million was primarily due to million of increased losses primarily related to power and transmission trading activities in the northeast  pjm  and ercot regions due to unfavorable price movements  execution of transactions to reduce our risk position consistent with changes in our strategy  and execution of those transactions in less liquid market conditions  lower gains of million from our emissions trading activities due primarily to unfavorable price movements  and million of increased losses related to unfavorable price movements on certain economic hedges of accrual transactions  primarily related to gas transportation and storage and freight activities that do not qualify for or are not designated as cash flow hedges 
the risk management and trading results were partially offset by million of gains primarily as a result of favorable price movements relating to economic hedges which substantially increased in value as coal prices decreased in the fourth quarter of these positions were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges and were de designated due to the announced sale of our international commodities operation  and million of gains primarily related to our wholesale and retail gas businesses due to favorable price movements on our sales of wholesale and retail natural gas 
we did not record any origination gains during during  our global commodities operation amended certain nonderivative contracts to mitigate counterparty performance risk under the existing contracts 
as a result of these amendments  the revised contracts became derivatives subject to mark to market accounting 
the change in accounting for these contracts from nonderivative to derivative resulted in substantially all of the origination gains for presented in the unrealized mark to market results table above 
during  our global commodities operation amended certain nonderivative power sales contracts such that the new contracts became derivatives subject to mark to market accounting 
simultaneous with the amending of the nonderivative contracts  we executed at current market prices several new offsetting derivative power purchase contracts subject to mark to market accounting 
the combination of these transactions resulted in substantially all of the origination gains presented for in the preceding table  as well as mitigated our risk exposure under the amended contracts 
the origination gains in from these transactions was partially offset by approximately million of losses in our accrual portfolio due to the reclassification of losses related to cash flow hedges previously established for the amended nonderivative contracts from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings 
in the absence of these transactions  the economic value represented by the origination gains and the losses associated with cash flow hedges would have been recognized over the remaining term of the contracts  which extended through the first quarter of the recognition of origination gains is generally dependent on sufficient available market data that validates the initial fair value of the contract 
liquidity and market conditions impact our ability to identify sufficient  objective market price information to permit recognition of origination gains 
as a result  the level of origination gains we are able to recognize may vary from year to year as a result of the number  size  and market price transparency of the individual transactions executed in any period 

table of contents derivative assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets noncurrent assets total assets current liabilities noncurrent liabilities total liabilities net derivative position composition of net derivative exposure hedges mark to market net cash collateral included in derivative balances net derivative position as discussed in our critical accounting policies section  our derivative assets and liabilities include contracts accounted for as hedges and those accounted for on a mark to market basis 
these amounts are presented in our consolidated balance sheets after the impact of netting  which is discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
due to the impacts of commodity prices  the number of open positions  master netting arrangements  and offsetting risk positions on the presentation of our derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  we believe an evaluation of the net position is the most relevant measure  and is discussed in more detail below 
however  we present our gross derivatives in note to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease of  million in our net derivative liability subject to hedge accounting since december  primarily was due to  million of realization of out of the money cash flow hedges at the time the forecasted transaction occurred  partially offset by million of increased unrealized losses on our remaining out of the money cash flow hedge positions primarily related to decreases in power  natural gas  and coal prices during the following are the primary sources of the change in our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting during and in millions fair value beginning of year changes in fair value recorded in earnings origination gains unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total changes in fair value changes in value of exchange listed futures and options net change in premiums on options contracts acquired dedesignated contracts and other changes in fair value fair value at end of year changes in our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting that affected earnings were as follows origination gains represent the initial unrealized fair value at the time these contracts are executed to the extent permitted by applicable accounting rules 
unrealized changes in fair value represent unrealized changes in commodity prices  the volatility of options on commodities  the time value of options  and other valuation adjustments 
changes in valuation techniques represent improvements in estimation techniques  including modeling and other statistical enhancements used to value our portfolio to more accurately reflect the economic value of our contracts 
reclassification of settled contracts to realized represents the portion of previously unrealized amounts settled during the period and recorded as realized revenues 
the net derivative asset also changed due to the following items recorded in accounts other than in our consolidated statements of income loss changes in value of exchange listed futures and options are adjustments to remove unrealized revenue from exchange traded contracts that are included in nonregulated revenues 
the fair value of these contracts is recorded in accounts receivable rather than derivative assets in our consolidated balance sheets because these amounts are settled through our margin account with a third party broker 
net changes in premiums on options reflects the accounting for premiums on options purchased as an increase in the net derivative asset and premiums on options sold as a decrease in the net derivative asset 
contracts acquired represents the initial fair value of acquired derivative contracts recorded in derivative assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
substantially all of this activity for related to the divestiture of our international commodities operation  houston based gas trading operation  and certain other trading operations in order to transfer risk and reward to the buyers 
dedesignated contracts and other changes in fair value include transfers of derivative contracts from cash flow hedges to mark to market treatment  transfers of derivative contracts from mark to market treatment to cash flow hedges  and those derivative contracts that did not meet the qualifications of cash flow hedge accounting 
during  substantially all of the activity related to dedesignations in connection with the strategic objective of restructuring and reducing the risk of our portfolio 

table of contents the settlement terms of the portion of our net derivative asset subject to mark to market accounting and sources of fair value based on the fair value hierarchy are as follows as of december  settlement term thereafter fair value in millions level level level total net derivative asset liability subject to mark to market accounting management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
additionally  because the depth and liquidity of the power markets varies substantially between regions and time periods  the prices used to determine fair value could be affected significantly by the volume of transactions executed 
future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
we manage our mark to market risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract 
accordingly  we manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based upon the commodity eg  electricity or gas  the product eg  electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours  the delivery location eg  by region  the risk profile eg  forward or option  and the delivery period eg  by month and year 
the electricity  fuel  and other energy contracts we hold have varying terms to maturity  ranging from contracts for delivery the next hour to contracts with terms of ten years or more 
because an active  liquid electricity futures market comparable to that for other commodities has not developed  many contracts are direct contracts between market participants and are not exchange traded or financially settling contracts that can be readily offset in their entirety through an exchange or other market mechanism 
consequently  we and other market participants generally realize the value of these contracts as cash flows become due or payable under the terms of the contracts rather than through selling or liquidating the contracts themselves 
in order to realize the entire value of a long term contract in a single transaction  we would need to sell or assign the entire contract 
if we were to sell or assign any of our long term contracts in their entirety  we may not realize the entire value reflected in the preceding table 
however  based upon the nature of our global commodities operation  we expect to realize the value of these contracts  as well as any contracts we may enter into in the future to manage our risk  over time as the contracts and related hedges settle in accordance with their terms 
generally  we do not expect to realize the value of these contracts and related hedges by selling or assigning the contracts themselves in total 
operating expenses our merchant energy business operating expenses decreased million during as compared to due to lower performance based labor and benefit costs of million and lower non labor operating expenses of million  part of which represents the absence of costs from the divestitures completed in and from deconsolidating ceng on november  our merchant energy business operating expenses decreased million during compared to due to lower performance based labor and benefit costs at our merchant energy business of million  partially offset by higher non labor operating expenses of million  which included approximately million of higher bad debt expense

residential customer rate credit on october   the maryland psc issued an order approving constellation energy s transaction with edf 
among other things  the order required constellation energy to fund a one time distribution rate credit for bge residential customers before the end of march totaling million  or approximately per customer  for which bge recorded a liability in november in december  bge filed a tariff with the maryland psc stating bge would give residential customers a rate credit of exactly per customer 
as a result  bge accrued an additional million for a total fourth quarter accrual of million 
the portion of this total credit allocated to residential electric customers was million pre tax 
this credit was accrued in the fourth quarter of and will be applied to bge residential electric customer bills in the first quarter of nuclear decommissioning charges effective january   bge and calvert cliffs nuclear power plant inc calvert cliffs mutually agreed to terminate the decommissioning funds collection agent agreement  which was effective from july  to december  as a result  bge ceased transferring funds to provide for the decommissioning of calvert cliffs unit and unit calvert cliffs retains the obligation to provide adequate assurances of funding pursuant to nuclear regulatory commission requirements 
under the maryland settlement agreement  bge will continue to provide certain credits to residential customers and assess certain charges to all customers relating to decommissioning 
smart energy savers program sm surcharge beginning in  the maryland psc approved customer surcharges through which bge recovers costs associated with certain programs designed to help bge manage peak demand and encourage customer energy conservation 
maryland settlement credit as discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  bge entered into a settlement agreement with the state of maryland and other parties  which provided residential electric customers a credit totaling per customer 
the estimated settlement of million was accrued in the second quarter of and a total of million was credited to customers in the third and fourth quarters of revenue decoupling the maryland psc has allowed us to record a monthly adjustment to our electric distribution revenues from residential and small commercial customers since and for the majority of our large commercial and industrial customers since february to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather and usage patterns per customer on our electric distribution volumes  thereby recovering a specified dollar amount of distribution revenues per customer  by customer class  regardless of changes in consumption levels 
this means bge recognizes revenues at maryland psc approved levels per customer  regardless of what actual distribution volumes were for a billing period 
therefore  while these revenues are affected by customer growth  they will not be affected by actual weather or usage conditions 
we then bill or credit impacted customers in subsequent months for the difference between approved revenue levels under revenue decoupling and actual customer billings

rate stabilization credits as a result of senate bill  we were required to defer from july  until may  a portion of the full market rate increase resulting from the expiration of the residential rate freeze 
in addition  we offered a plan also required under senate bill allowing residential customers the option to defer the transition to market rates from june  until january  revenues in increased compared to as a result of the expiration of the rate stabilization plans 
rate stabilization recovery in late june  bge began recovering amounts deferred during the first rate deferral period that ended on may  the recovery of the first rate stabilization plan will occur over approximately ten years 
in april  bge began recovering amounts deferred during the second rate deferral period that ended on december  the recovery of the second rate deferral occurred over a month period that began april  and ended on december  financing credits concurrent with the recovery of the deferred amounts related to the first rate deferral period  we are providing credits to residential customers to compensate them primarily for income tax benefits associated with the financing of the deferred amounts with rate stabilization bonds 
senate bill credits as a result of senate bill  beginning january   we were required to provide to residential electric customers a credit equal to the amount collected from all bge electric customers for the decommissioning of our calvert cliffs nuclear power plant and to suspend collection of the residential return component of the administrative charge collected through residential sos rates through may  under an order issued by the maryland psc in may  as of june   we were required to reinstate collection of the residential return component of the administration charge in rates and to provide all residential electric customers a credit for the residential return component of the administrative charge 
under the maryland settlement agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  bge was allowed to resume collection of the residential return portion of the administrative charge from june  through may  without having to rebate it to residential customers

gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
however  under the market based rates mechanism approved by the maryland psc  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers 
customers who do not purchase gas from bge are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
however  these customers are charged base rates to recover the costs bge incurs to deliver their gas through our distribution system  and are included in the gas distribution volume revenues

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable decreased million from million at december  to million at december   primarily related to a decrease of million in our merchant energy business  partially offset by an increase of million at our regulated electric and gas businesses 
the decrease in allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from our merchant energy business is primarily driven by the write off of the accounts receivable and related allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable balances for certain customers that were established primarily during when these counterparties encountered financial difficulties 
there was no earnings impact associated with these write offs in the increase in allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from our regulated electric and gas businesses is primarily driven by a maryland psc ruling in the second quarter of and the economic downturn which continues to cause a decreased ability of customers to pay their utility bills 
the maryland psc ruling in the second quarter of delayed bge s ability to terminate service to customers with arrearages and required bge to offer those customers the option to enter into extended payment plans 
bge ceased entering into these extended plans on september  if the current economic downturn continues on a prolonged basis  our and bge s bad debt expense could materially increase in the future despite our efforts to mitigate those risks 
we discuss our credit risk in more detail in the risk management section 
financial condition balance sheet effects of transaction with edf the completion of the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf on november  had the following significant effects on our consolidated balance sheets received cash proceeds of approximately billion  increased current and noncurrent unamortized energy contract assets by a total of billion  increased our accrued taxes by approximately billion  decreased our long term debt by approximately billion as a result of retiring all of the shares of our series b preferred stock issued to edf as partial purchase price for their purchase of a interest in ceng  and increased our retained earnings as a result of recording a billion after tax gain on the transaction 
additionally  we deconsolidated ceng for financial reporting purposes 
the deconsolidation had significant effects on our consolidated balance sheets including the following recorded an initial investment in ceng for approximately billion as we treated our retained interest in ceng as an equity investment  removed the nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets of approximately billion  decreased net property  plant and equipment by approximately billion  decreased our defined benefits by approximately billion as a result of the separation of benefit plans  and decreased asset retirement obligations by approximately billion

the increase decrease in restricted funds at our holding company and other is primarily related to billion of restricted cash related to the issuance of series b preferred stock to edf 
these funds were held at the holding company and were restricted for payment of the senior notes held by midamerican 
the senior notes were repaid in full in january certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was billion in compared to cash used in operating activities of billion in this billion increase in cash flows was primarily due to billion as a result of ongoing cash outflows from derivative contracts deemed to contain a financing element at inception that must be classified as financing activities rather than operating activities 
we discuss the impact on cash flows from financing activities below 
billion related to changes in net derivative assets and liabilities 
changes in derivative assets and liabilities are driven by fluctuations in commodity prices and the realization of contracts at settlement within our merchant energy business 
billion of improved operating cash flows from our regulated businesses 
billion more in net collateral and margin returned in as compared to as follows december  in millions net collateral and margin posted  beginning of year return of collateral held associated with nonderivative contracts net return of additional collateral posted associated with nonderivative contracts return of additional initial and variation margin posted on exchange traded transactions recorded in accounts receivable return of additional fair value net cash collateral posted netted against derivative assets liabilities change in net collateral and margin posted net collateral and margin held  end of year we discuss our netting of fair value collateral with our derivative assets liabilities in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the billion decrease in net collateral and margin posted during primarily reflects the following collateral returned reduced as part of the divestiture of a majority of our international commodities operation and gas trading operation as well as the execution of a gas supply agreement with the buyer of the gas trading operation for the retail gas business  fewer contracts as a result of reducing the risk in our portfolio  the termination of in the money contracts  and changes in commodity prices and the level of our open positions 
cash used in operating activities was billion in compared to cash provided by operating activities of billion in this billion decrease in cash flows was primarily due to a billion increase in net collateral and margin posted  billion use of cash  consisting of billion paid to midamerican related to the termination of the merger  billion paid to midamerican for settling a portion of the conversion of the series a preferred stock in cash  and billion paid to various parties for merger and other strategic alternatives costs  billion of credits rebated to residential electric customers by bge as a result of the maryland settlement agreement  and billion of additional interest paid 
cash flows from investing activities cash provided by investing activities was billion in compared to cash used of billion in the billion increase in cash provided in compared to was primarily due to billion of net proceeds at the closing the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf 
we discuss this transaction in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there was no such activity in  billion decrease in restricted funds  primarily due to the receipt of funds in and the release of funds in for the repayment of the billion of senior notes to midamerican in january  and billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions 
in  million was used for the acquisition of clt efficient technologies group  an energy services company that provides energy performance contracting and energy efficiency engineering services  and million was used as a down payment for the pending acquisition of the criterion wind project in garrett county  maryland 
in  billion was used for the acquisition of the hillabee energy center  a partially completed mw gas fired combined cycle power generation facility in alabama  the west valley power plant  a mw gas fired peaking plant  and a uranium market participant 
this increase was partially offset by billion of cash used for contract and portfolio acquisitions as a component of our strategic divestitures 
as a result of the structure of the divestitures of a majority of our international commodities  houston based gas trading and other trading operations  we are required to present investing cash flows for in the money contracts on a gross basis separate from financing cash inflows for out of the money contracts executed simultaneously 
we discuss our divestitures in 
table of contents more detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there was no such activity in billion of cash used for a working capital investment in ceng of billion and a contribution to une of billion 
cash used in investing activities was billion in compared to billion in the billion increase in cash used in compared to was primarily due to the increase in restricted cash of billion  primarily relating to the billion proceeds received from the issuance of series b preferred stock to edf that is restricted to pay the senior notes 
the proceeds from the series b preferred stock issuance  as discussed in the cash flows from financing section below  are the source of the funds for the increase in restricted cash 
the senior notes were subsequently paid in january the increase in investments in property  plant and equipment of billion 
this increase was primarily driven by environmental spending of billion for our brandon shores coal fired generating plant and million in construction costs at our partially completed gas fired combined cycle power generating facility in alabama 
these increased uses of cash in investing activities are partially offset by the absence in of billion of cash used in for contract and portfolio acquisitions  which we discuss in more detail below  and approximately billion of higher proceeds received from sales of investments in compared to the proceeds in include million of cash received from edf that was recorded as additional proceeds for edf s purchase of membership interest in ceng in cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities was billion in compared to cash provided of billion in the increase in cash used for financing activities of billion was primarily due to billion net increase in cash used to repay short term borrowings and long term debt primarily due to the repayment of the billion senior notes to midamerican in january  billion in net repayments of short term credit facilities  billion repayment of a fixed rate note  and a billion repayment of zero coupon senior notes  billion net decrease in cash received from the issuance of long term debt  and billion in cash outflows related to derivative contracts deemed to contain a financing element at inception that must be classified as financing activities rather than operating activities 
these contracts primarily relate to transactions associated with the divestiture of our international commodities operation  houston based gas trading operation and certain other trading operations 
during  we executed derivatives as part of these divestiture transactions at prices that differed from then current market prices 
as a result  cash flows associated with the out of the money derivative transactions are deemed to contain a financing element  and we must record the ongoing cash flows related to these contracts as financing cash flows 
we discuss our divestitures in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
this increase in cash used for financing activities was partially offset by billion of cash provided from contract and portfolio acquisitions as a component of our strategic divestitures 
as a result of the structure of the divestitures of a majority of our international commodities  houston based gas trading and other trading operations  we are required to present financing cash inflows for out of the money contracts on a gross basis separate from investing cash outflows for in the money contracts executed simultaneously 
we discuss our divestitures in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
there was no such activity in cash provided by financing activities was billion in compared to billion in the increase of billion was primarily due to the issuance of billion of mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock to edf  the proceeds of which are reflected in the increase in restricted cash  as discussed in the cash flows from investing activities above  billion of mandatorily redeemable convertible series a preferred stock to midamerican  which was converted  in part  in december into billion of senior notes  which were repaid in full in january  million of zero coupon notes  million of series a junior subordinated debentures  and million of notes by bge 
contract and portfolio acquisitions during and  our merchant energy business acquired several pre existing energy purchase and sale agreements  which generated significant cash flows at the inception of the contracts 
these agreements had contract prices that differed from market prices at closing  which resulted in cash payments from the counterparty at the acquisition of the contract 
we received net cash of million in due to the execution of total return swaps to assist in the execution of our divestitures of our international commodities and houston based gas trading operations and million in for various contract and portfolio acquisitions 
we reflect the underlying contracts on a gross basis as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets depending on whether they were above or below market prices at closing  therefore  we have also reflected them on a 
table of contents gross basis in cash flows from investing and financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows as follows year ended december  in millions financing activities proceeds from contract and portfolio acquisitions investing activities contract and portfolio acquisitions cash flows from contract and portfolio acquisitions we record the proceeds we receive to acquire energy purchase and sale agreements as a financing cash inflow because it constitutes a prepayment for a portion of the market price of energy  which we will buy or sell over the term of the agreements and does not represent a cash inflow from current period operating activities 
for those acquired contracts that are derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract with the counterparties as financing cash inflows 
for those acquired contracts that are not derivatives  we record the ongoing cash flows related to the contract as operating cash flows 
we discuss certain of these contract and portfolio acquisitions in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
cash flow impacts ceng joint venture prior to november   we recorded of the revenues  expenses  and cash flows from ceng and the nuclear plants it owns because we wholly owned this entity 
on november   we completed the sale of a membership interest in ceng to edf  and we deconsolidated ceng 
accordingly  for the period from november  through december   we ceased recording ceng s cash flows and began to record cash flows from our ppa and other transactions with ceng 
in the future  we will record cash flows from any distributions received from ceng based on our ownership interest  and we may be required to make capital contributions to help fund ceng s capital program 
as a result of deconsolidation  we expect that our future merchant energy cash flows will differ from historical cash flows primarily due to the following factors we will sell between of the output of ceng s plants  excluding output sold by ceng directly to third parties  rather than of the plants total output including volumes contracted to third parties 
fuel and purchased energy expenses will reflect our purchase of of the output of ceng s plants  excluding output sold directly to third parties  as provided under the terms of the ppa with ceng 
operating expenses will no longer include ceng s plant operating costs or general and administrative expenses 
we will no longer incur cash flows for of ceng s capital expenditures or the acquisition of nuclear fuel  but we may be required to make capital contributions to help ceng fund these expenditures 
we will record cash distributions from ceng if and when such distributions are declared 
in addition  we entered into a power services agency agreement psa and an administrative service agreement asa with ceng 
the psa is a five year agreement under which we will provide scheduling  asset management and billing services to ceng and will recognize average annual revenue of approximately million 
the asa is a one year agreement that is renewable annually under which we will provide administrative support services to ceng for a fee of approximately million for the level of fees for administrative support services will be subject to change in future years based on the level of services provided 
the charges under these agreements are intended to represent the actual cost of the services provided to ceng from us 
security ratings independent credit rating agencies rate constellation energy s and bge s fixed income securities 
the ratings indicate the agencies assessment of each company s ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends  and principal on these securities 
these ratings affect how much it will cost each company to sell these securities and  in certain cases  the company s ability to access the markets to sell securities 
generally  the better the rating  the lower the cost of the securities to each company when they sell them 
a reduction in our credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our access to liquidity sources  increase our cost of funds  trigger additional collateral requirements  and or decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to transact with us 
the factors that credit rating agencies consider in establishing constellation energy s and bge s credit ratings include  but are not limited to  cash flows  liquidity  business risk profile  stock price volatility  political  legislative and regulatory risk  interest charges relative to operating cash flow  and the level of debt relative to operating cash flows and to total capitalization 

table of contents at the date of this report  our credit ratings were as follows standard poors rating group moody s investors service fitch ratings constellation energy senior unsecured debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f junior subordinated debentures bb ba bb bge senior unsecured debt bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p f rate stabilization bonds aaa aaa aaa trust preferred securities bbb baa bbb preference stock bbb ba bbb bonds issued by rsb bondco llc  a subsidiary of bge as a result of changes in guidelines at fitch ratings affecting all issuers  in january the ratings of our junior subordinated debentures and bge s trust preferred securities and preference stock were downgraded one level 
all constellation energy and bge ratings in the above table reflect stable outlooks by all the credit rating agencies 
as a condition to the october maryland psc order approving our transaction with edf  constellation energy and bge were required to implement ring fencing measures to provide bankruptcy protection and credit rating separation of bge from constellation energy 
we completed the implementation of these measures in february we remain committed to maintaining a stable investment grade credit profile and to meeting our liquidity requirements 
we discuss our available sources of funding in more detail below 
we discuss the potential effect of a ratings downgrade in the collateral section 
available sources of funding in addition to cash generated from operations  we rely upon access to capital for our capital expenditure programs and for the liquidity required to operate and support our commercial businesses 
our liquidity requirements are funded by credit facilities and cash 
we fund our short term working capital needs with existing cash and with our credit facilities  many of which support direct cash borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper 
we also use our credit facilities to support the issuance of letters of credit  primarily for our merchant energy business 
the primary drivers of our use of liquidity have been our capital expenditure requirements and collateral requirements associated with hedging our generating assets and hedging our customer supply business in both power and gas 
as part of our strategic initiatives  we have modified the structure of certain transactions and terminated others in order to reduce these collateral requirements 
significant changes in the prices of commodities  depending on hedging strategies we have employed  could require us to post additional letters of credit  and thereby reduce the overall amount available under our credit facilities or to post additional cash  and thereby reduce our available cash balance 
we discuss our  and bge s  credit facilities in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net available liquidity the following tables provide a summary of our net available liquidity at december  and as of december  constellation energy bge total consolidated in billions credit facilities less letters of credit issued less cash drawn on credit facilities undrawn facilities less commercial paper outstanding net available facilities add cash less reserved cash cash and facility liquidity add edf put arrangement net available liquidity excludes billion commodity linked credit facility due to its contingent nature 
we discuss this credit facility in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
represents management s expectation of income tax payments to be made for the edf transaction and remaining bond repurchases in the first quarter of we discuss our bond repurchases in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  constellation energy bge total consolidated in billions credit facilities less letters of credit issued less cash drawn on credit facilities undrawn facilities less commercial paper outstanding net available facilities add cash net available liquidity 
table of contents during  net available liquidity increased billion due to the following in billions expiration of edf interim backstop liquidity facility credit facility reductions triggered by completion of ceng joint venture new credit facilities added net reduction in credit facilities decrease in letters of credit issued repayment of cash drawn on facilities increase in cash less cash reserved for tax payments and debt reductions edf put arrangement  after tax increase in net available liquidity includes billion facility that was set to expire in november through our efforts to reduce risk and more actively manage our liquidity  we significantly improved our net available liquidity during specifically  we executed on our planned divestitures  significantly reduced the activities of our global commodities operation  and restructured and terminated existing transactions and amended certain agreements  all of which have led to lower collateral requirements 
through december   we received substantially all of the billion of total net collateral expected to be returned upon the completion of our divestitures 
in addition  we added new credit facilities during that are discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
during  our cash balance increased billion 
the increase is largely a result of the proceeds from the edf transaction and strong cash flows in our core businesses  partially offset by bond repayments and the retirement of debt prior to maturity 
we discuss our cash flows in more detail earlier in the cash flows section and the edf transaction in the significant events section 
we intend to use the funds from the edf transaction to pay the taxes owed on the transaction  to fulfill our billion voluntary debt reduction commitment  to fund strategic growth initiatives  and for other general corporate purposes 
we discuss our voluntary debt reduction in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its approval of the edf transaction  we were required by the maryland psc to implement ring fencing measures designed to provide bankruptcy protection and credit rating separation of bge from constellation energy 
we discuss the maryland psc order in more detail in the regulation maryland section 
these ring fencing measures were implemented in  and as a result bge no longer participates in the constellation energy cash pool 
in december  constellation energy contributed approximately million of equity million capital contribution and million for a residential customer rate credit to bge as required by the maryland psc order approving the edf transaction 
as a result of bge terminating participation in the constellation energy cash pool  this equity contribution will be reflected in the cash balance of bge beginning in january our liquidity needs vary as commodity prices change 
we regularly evaluate the effects of changing price levels on our liquidity needs by estimating the impacts of volatile power  gas  and coal prices on our price sensitive sources and uses of liquidity 
for example  energy contracts settling in the current year may impact our cash flows and changing price levels may impact our collateral requirements 
additionally  we consider the impact of other sources and uses of liquidity  including planned business divestitures  anticipated new business  capital expenditures  operating expenses and credit charges 
we believe that the actions that we have taken and our current net available liquidity will be sufficient to support our ongoing liquidity requirements 
our liquidity projections include assumptions for commodity price changes  which are subject to significant volatility  and we are exposed to certain operational risks that could have a significant impact on our liquidity 
we discuss items that could negatively impact our liquidity in the item a 
risk factors section 
collateral constellation energy s collateral requirements generally arise from its merchant energy business need to participate in certain organized markets  such as independent system operators isos or financial exchanges  as well as from our margining on over the counter otc contracts 
to support wholesale and retail power customer supply obligations and our limited trading activities  constellation energy posts collateral to isos 
forward hedging of our generation and customer supply obligations  as well as our global commodities trading activities  creates the need to transact with exchanges such as new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange 
we post initial margin based on exchange rules  as well as variation margin related to the change in value of the net open position with the exchange 
constellation energy s initial margin requirements increased during the third quarter of as a result of changes in exchange rules and decreased during the fourth quarter of as a result of portfolio risk reduction and downsizing activities 
during  our initial margin requirements continued to decrease 
in march and april  we closed out our exchange positions related to our international commodities operation and houston based gas trading operation  respectively  which reduced our margin posted with each exchange with which we transact 
in addition to the collateral posted to isos and exchanges  we post collateral with certain otc counterparties 
these collateral amounts may be fixed or may vary with price levels 
there are certain inherent asymmetries relating to the use of collateral that create liquidity requirements for our merchant energy businesses 
these asymmetries arise from our actions to be economically hedged  as well as market conditions or 
table of contents conventions for conducting business that result in some transactions being collateralized while others are not  including in our customer supply operation  we generally do not receive collateral under contractual obligations to supply power or gas to our customers but our global commodities operation hedges these transactions through purchases of power and gas that generally require us to post collateral 
by entering into a gas supply agreement with the buyer of our gas trading operation  we have reduced our collateral requirements to support our retail gas operation 
we discuss this gas supply agreement in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also intend to further align our load obligations by buying generation assets in regions where we do not have a significant generation presence and entering into longer tenor agreements with merchant generators  further reducing our dependence on exchange traded products  thereby lowering our collateral requirements 
in our generation operation  we may have to post collateral on our power sale or fuel purchase contracts 
finally  collateral types may asymmetrically impact our liquidity 
for example  in margining with over the counter counterparties  we may post letter of credit lc collateral for an out of the money counterparty 
however  we may receive lc collateral when we are in the money with a counterparty 
posting lcs reduces our liquidity while the receipt of lc collateral does not increase our liquidity 
customers of our merchant energy business rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy 
in this regard  we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require us to post additional collateral upon a credit rating downgrade in the senior unsecured debt of constellation energy 
based on contractual provisions at december   we estimate that if constellation energy s senior unsecured debt were downgraded to one level below the investment grade threshold we would have the following additional collateral obligations credit ratings downgraded to level below current rating additional obligations in billions below investment grade if there are split ratings among the independent credit rating agencies  the lowest credit rating is used to determine our incremental collateral obligations 
includes billion related to derivative contracts as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
based on market conditions and contractual obligations at the time of a downgrade  we could be required to post additional collateral in an amount that could exceed the obligation amounts specified above  which could be material 
we discuss our credit facilities in the available sources of funding section 
capital resources our actual consolidated capital requirements for the years through  along with the estimated annual amount for  are shown in the following table 
we will continue to have cash requirements for working capital needs  payments of interest  distributions  and dividends  capital expenditures  and the retirement of debt 
capital requirements for and include estimates of spending for existing and anticipated projects 
we continuously review and modify those estimates 
actual requirements may vary from the estimates included in the table below because of a number of factors including regulation  legislation  and competition  bge load requirements  environmental protection standards  the type and number of projects selected for construction or acquisition  the effect of market conditions on those projects  the cost and availability of capital  potential capital contributions to ceng and une  the availability of cash from operations  and business decisions to invest in capital projects 
our estimates are also subject to additional factors 
please see the forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors sections 
estimate in billions nonregulated capital requirements merchant energy excludes acquisitions generation plants environmental controls portfolio acquisitions investments technology other nuclear fuel total merchant energy capital requirements other nonregulated capital requirements total nonregulated capital requirements regulated capital requirements regulated electric regulated gas total regulated capital requirements total capital requirements reflects the closing of the transaction with edf on november  and the deconsolidation of our nuclear generation and operation business 
as a result  the table above includes ten months of nuclear plant related and nuclear fuel capital requirements for and none effective in 
table of contents as of the date of this report  we estimate our capital requirements will be approximately billion 
capital requirements merchant energy business our merchant energy business capital requirements consist of its continuing requirements  including expenditures for improvements to generating plants  costs of complying with the environmental protection agency epa  maryland  and pennsylvania environmental regulations and legislation  and enhancements to our information technology infrastructure 
in addition  in december  we were selected by the state of maryland to construct  own  operate and maintain a mw solar photovoltaic power installation in emmitsburg  maryland 
we expect this project to cost us approximately million and be completed by december renewable electricity produced by the system will be purchased by the state of maryland at the site of mount st 
mary s university under a year solar power purchase agreement 
in  we signed an agreement to acquire the mw criterion wind project in garrett county  maryland 
the completed cost of this project is expected to be approximately million 
we expect to close this transaction  subject to certain conditions  in the first quarter of and expect commercial operation of the facility in the fall of regulated electric and gas regulated electric and gas construction expenditures primarily include new business construction needs and improvements to existing facilities  including projects to improve reliability and support demand response and conservation initiatives 
in july  bge filed with the maryland psc a proposal for a comprehensive smart grid initiative 
the proposal includes the planned installation of million residential and commercial electric and gas smart meters 
we expect the total cost of the program to be approximately million 
in october  the united states department of energy selected bge as a recipient of million in federal funding for our smart grid initiative 
this grant allows bge to be reimbursed for smart grid expenditures up to million  substantially reducing the total cost of this initiative 
however  the united states department of energy may withhold funding until approval is obtained from the maryland psc 
the maryland psc held hearings on this proposed program in late and expects to issue an order in the first quarter of if bge s proposal is approved by the maryland psc  bge plans to proceed with this program as soon as practical 
funding for capital requirements merchant energy business we expect to fund the capital requirements of our merchant energy business with internally generated cash and other available sources 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the money markets  capital markets and lease markets  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from drawdowns on credit facilities 
the projects that our merchant energy business develops typically require substantial capital investment 
many of the qualifying facilities and independent power projects that we have an interest in as well as our upstream properties are financed primarily with non recourse debt that is repaid from the project s cash flows 
this debt is collateralized by interests in the physical assets  major project contracts and agreements  cash accounts and  in some cases  the ownership interest in that project 
regulated electric and gas we expect to fund capital expenditures associated with our regulated electric and gas businesses through a combination of internally and externally generated cash 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the short term and long term capital markets including trust preferred securities or preference stock  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from drawdowns on credit facilities 
bge may also receive equity contributions from time to time from constellation energy 
in december  bge received a million capital contribution from constellation energy as required by the october order from the maryland psc approving our transaction with edf 
at that time  constellation energy also funded the after tax cost of million of the residential customer credits required by the same order 
other nonregulated businesses we expect to fund the capital requirements of our other nonregulated businesses with internally generated cash 
to the extent that internally generated cash is not sufficient to meet those requirements  we would seek additional funding from the short term and long term capital markets and lease markets  subject to credit conditions and market liquidity  and  if necessary  from drawdowns on credit facilities 
we may also consider sales of securities and assets  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
contractual payment obligations and committed amounts we enter into various agreements that result in contractual payment obligations in connection with our business activities 
these obligations primarily relate to our financing arrangements such as long term debt  preference stock  and operating leases  purchases of capacity and energy to support the growth in our merchant energy business activities  and purchases of fuel and transportation to satisfy the fuel requirements of our power generating facilities 

table of contents we detail our contractual payment obligations as of december  in the following table payments thereafter total in millions contractual payment obligations long term debt nonregulated principal interest total bge principal interest total bge preference stock operating leases operating leases  gross sublease rentals operating leases  net purchase obligations purchased capacity and energy purchased energy from ceng fuel and transportation other other noncurrent liabilities uncertain tax positions liability pension benefits postretirement and post employment benefits total contractual payment obligations amounts in long term debt reflect the original maturity date 
investors may require us to repay million early through remarketing features 
interest on variable rate debt is included based on forward curve for interest rates 
our operating lease commitments include future payment obligations under certain power purchase agreements as discussed further in note to consolidated financial statements 
contracts to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms 
amounts related to certain purchase obligations are based on future purchase expectations which may differ from actual purchases 
our contractual obligations for purchased capacity and energy are shown on a gross basis for certain transactions  including both the fixed payment portions of tolling contracts and estimated variable payments under unit contingent power purchase agreements 
amounts related to pension benefits reflect our current year forecast for contributions for our qualified pension plans and participant payments for our nonqualified pension plans 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for more detail on our pension plans 
amounts related to postretirement and postemployment benefits are for unfunded plans and reflect present value amounts consistent with the determination of the related liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements for financing and other business purposes  we utilize certain off balance sheet arrangements that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
such arrangements do not represent a significant part of our activities or a significant ongoing source of financing 
we use these arrangements when they enable us to obtain financing or execute commercial transactions on favorable terms 
as of december   we have no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees with third parties that are subject to initial recognition and measurement requirements  retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such asset  derivative instruments indexed to our common stock  and classified as equity  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services 
at december   constellation energy had a total face amount of billion in guarantees outstanding  of which billion related to our merchant energy business 
these amounts generally do not represent incremental consolidated constellation energy obligations  rather  they primarily represent parental guarantees of certain subsidiary obligations to third parties in order to allow our subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post other forms of collateral 
our estimated net exposure for obligations under commercial transactions covered by these guarantees was approximately billion at december   which represents the total amount the parent company could be required to fund based on december  market prices 
for those guarantees related to our derivative liabilities  the fair value of the obligation is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe it is unlikely that we would be required to perform or incur any losses associated with guarantees of our subsidiaries obligations 
we discuss our other guarantees in note to consolidated financial statements and our significant variable interests in note to consolidated financial statements 
risk management introduction constellation energy is exposed to market  credit  operational  and business risks that are fundamental to our business of providing products and services across the energy value chain 
in general  the risks in our businesses can be classified as one of the following market risk risk related to changes in energy commodity prices  volatilities  market price correlations  interest rates  and currencies as well as volume uncertainty  load requirements  physical location and supply  and market rules  credit risk risk related to a customer s or supplier s inability to fulfill its contractual obligations due to financial distress  operational risk risk associated with human error or a failure of process and systems  or external factors  as well as the risk of operating owned and contractually controlled generating assets  and electric transmission and gas transportation systems  business risk risk of unsuccessful business performance due to changing economic conditions  competition  regulatory environment  legislation  and economic conditions  and funding liquidity risk risk that we may be unable to fund our obligations in some future period 
these risks exist in our business with varying levels of exposure  and are interrelated and cannot be managed in isolation 

table of contents each of the five risk classifications noted above can be affected by numerous internal and external forces  including economic conditions  market liquidity  competition  country or sovereign issues  systems or process failure  and fiscal and monetary policies 
as a result of the extent and diversity of the risks the company faces in its business operations  we analyze risk and risk concentration at transaction  portfolio  business  and enterprise wide levels to ensure that material risks are identified and managed effectively 
we utilize numerous methods to evaluate and measure risks 
in general  we evaluate risks in terms of the impact on our economic value  earnings  liquidity  strategic objectives  credit rating  reputation  and values 
we identify and evaluate risks based not only on their probability of occurring and magnitude of impact on the financial statements  but also with respect to the potential for significant or unexpected shifts in market conditions or rules 
we recognize the importance of managing risk as a key differentiator in the energy business and view the active and effective management of the risks in our businesses to be of paramount importance 
to foster a culture of risk awareness and management  we employ a risk management framework to identify  assess  monitor  manage  and report risks 
our risk management program is based on established policies and procedures to manage risks  combined with an extensive system of internal controls 
nevertheless  no system of risk management can cost effectively eliminate all risks to which an entity is exposed 
thus  in particular environments  the company may not be able to mitigate risk exposures to the level desired and may have exposures to certain risk factors that cannot be mitigated 
in this section  we will review the company s risk in terms of our risk governance  risk controls  and risk exposures 
risk governance the audit committee of the board of directors periodically reviews compliance with our risk parameters  limits  and trading guidelines and our board of directors has established a var limit 
as discussed below  senior management is responsible for monitoring the key risks  facilitated by a risk management group rmg 
our rmg is responsible for enforcing compliance with risk management policies and risk limits  as well as managing credit risk 
the rmg reports to the chief risk officer  who provides regular risk management updates to the audit committee and the board of directors 
we also have a risk management committee rmc that is responsible for establishing risk management policies  reviewing procedures for the identification  assessment  measurement  and management of risks  and monitoring and reporting risk exposures 
the rmc meets on a regular basis and is chaired by our chief executive officer  and consists of our chief risk officer  chief financial officer  vice chairman  general counsel  chief human resources officer  head of corporate strategy and development  head of corporate affairs  public  and environmental policy and business unit leaders 
in addition  the chief risk officer coordinates with the risk management committees at the business units that meet regularly to identify  assess  and quantify material risk issues and to develop strategies to manage these risks 
in an effort to manage market and credit risks  constellation energy has established a series of limits that reflect the company s risk tolerances in the context of the market environment and our business strategy 
in setting limits  the company takes into consideration factors such as market volatility  product liquidity  business trends  and management experience 
the company maintains different limits at the corporate and business unit levels 
business units are responsible for adhering to established limits  against which exposures are monitored and reported 
limit breaches are reported in a timely manner to senior management  who consults with the business unit on an appropriate course of action 
risk controls risk controls are applied at the level of individual exposures and portfolios of exposures in each business and to risk in aggregate  across all businesses and major risk types  relative to the company s risk capacity 
constellation energy s rmg is an independent function tasked with providing an independent quantification and assessment of key business risks  as well as providing an evaluation of individual risk components that contribute to the company s consolidated risk profile 
the rmg is also responsible for establishing risk policies  maintaining appropriate risk controls  ensuring compliance with policies and procedures  and monitoring methods according to the risk parameters established by the board of directors 
the rmg consists of six divisions that focus on a specialized area of risk 
credit risk management credit risk management is responsible for managing the risk of loss inherent in the business units stemming from counterparty or customer failures and adverse market events that effect counterparty creditworthiness 
this group supports the business units by establishing credit relationships with various wholesale counterparties and retail customers and facilitating market liquidity with credit limits and appropriate contractual credit terms and conditions 
credit risk managers are responsible for managing credit risk associated with our business activities  including establishing limits and contractual structures  as well as establishing and enforcing credit policies 
market risk management market risk management is responsible for effectively identifying  quantifying  monitoring  and reporting on impacts of market risk  to include price volatility  correlations  volume uncertainty  market liquidity  interest rate and currency exposure on company businesses 
the market risk group also enforces the 
table of contents market risk policies and ensures compliance with these policies  including the monitoring  analyzing  and escalating of market risk controls 
this group also develops market risk measurement tools  such as stress and scenario tests  gross margin at risk  and assists the businesses in implementing market strategies with the highest benefits 
collateral risk management collateral risk management is responsible for providing an integrated view on credit  market  and company liquidity risks to facilitate treasury s management of the company s collateral and overall liquidity position 
this group s responsibilities include measuring and monitoring collateral flows  downgrade collateral needs  and collateral use across the company 
additionally  this group forecasts expected collateral requirements as well as estimates potential collateral requirements due to market shifts  hedging strategies  and adjustments to the company s credit ratings 
finally  collateral risk management assists the businesses in determining the strategic use of collateral and the appropriate cost of collateral for transactions 
the group also works closely with the treasury function to plan for expected and contingent liquidity needs based on the company s long term business plan 
operational risk management each business area maintains responsibility for operational risk management 
a corporate staff oversees implementation of a common framework for defining  measuring  monitoring  and reporting operational risks 
corporate audit corporate audit assists in ensuring that controls put in place by management to mitigate the risks of the business are adequate and functioning appropriately 
this group supports the risk assessment process including the analysis of inherent and residual risk  performs risk based audits as approved by the audit committee of the board of directors  and supports the improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of key business processes 
risk infrastructure risk infrastructure supports the risk management divisions and consolidates risk exposures across the businesses and disciplines 
this group s responsibilities include risk and credit systems design and maintenance  risk metric development and calculation  controls structure and enforcement  and risk reporting 
in addition  the risk infrastructure group provides analytical support to the risk functions  validates company models  and verifies liquid and illiquid forward price curves and volatilities 
finally  this group performs independent risk assessments  due diligence  and risk adjusted valuations of transactions  mergers and acquisitions  and large capital projects 
risk exposures we manage risks across our merchant energy  regulated electric  and regulated gas businesses 
we summarize below the risks we manage within each of our businesses 
merchant energy business our merchant energy business is exposed to various risks in the competitive marketplace that may materially impact our financial results and affect our earnings 
these risks include changes in commodity prices  potential imbalances in supply and demand  credit risk and operational risk 
regulated electric business bge does not own or operate any electric generating facilities 
therefore  bge s regulated electric business is exposed to market price risk 
to mitigate this  bge obtains energy and capacity to provide sos through a competitive bidding process approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss sos and the impact on base rates in more detail in item business baltimore gas and electric company electric business section 
as a result of this process  bge s exposure to market price risk is limited  and at december   our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated electric business was not material 
however  bge may enter into electric futures  options  and swaps to hedge its market price risk if appropriate 
we discuss this further in note to consolidated financial statements 
bge s regulated electric business is also exposed to wholesale credit risk from its suppliers as well as retail credit risk from its customers 
finally  bge is subject to operational risks  including potential impacts from storms and distribution asset failures 
regulated gas business bge acquires all of its natural gas for delivery to customers from third party suppliers 
therefore  bge s regulated gas business is exposed to market price risk 
however  bge recovers the costs of purchased gas under the market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
additionally  bge may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program as appropriate 
we discuss this further in note to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
bge s regulated gas business is also exposed to wholesale credit risk from its suppliers as well as retail credit risk from its customers 
finally  bge is subject to operational risks  including potential impacts from storms and distribution asset failures 
risk exposure categories the various categories of risk exposures that we manage include  but are not limited to  market risk  which includes interest rate risk  security price risk  and foreign currency risk  credit risk  which includes wholesale and retail  operational risk and funding liquidity risk 
as previously noted  these risks may be common to more than one of our businesses 
we discuss each of these primary risk exposure categories separately below 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of power  natural gas  coal  and other related commodities 
these risks arise from our ownership and 
table of contents operation of power plants  our customer supply operations  and our origination  risk management  and trading activities 
these commodity price risks arise from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity  natural gas  coal  and other related commodities  changes in market volatilities or correlations  and changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
we use such commodities and products in our merchant energy business  and if we do not hedge the associated financial exposure  this commodity price volatility could adversely affect our economic value or earnings 
these factors include seasonal  daily  and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical power system during extreme conditions  changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations  and geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of coal  oil  and natural gas 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical power and gas systems  and the nature and extent of power market restructuring 
additionally  we have fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  and oil prices 
our power generation facilities purchase fuel under contracts or in the spot market 
fuel prices may be volatile  and the price that can be obtained from electricity sales may not change at the same rate or in the same direction as changes in fuel costs 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
as part of our overall portfolio  we manage the market risk of our merchant energy business  including electricity sales  fuel and energy purchases  emission credits  interest rate  foreign currency  weather  and the market risk of outages 
in order to manage these risks  we may enter into fixed price derivative or non derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of energy  including forward contracts  which commit us to purchase or sell energy commodities in the future  futures contracts  which are exchange traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument  or to make a cash settlement  at a specific price and future date  swap agreements  which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual notional quantity  and option contracts  which convey the right to buy or sell a commodity  financial instrument  or index at a predetermined price 
the objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on our electric generation operations  fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of our power plants  fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply our load serving customers  managing our collateral requirements  and managing our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks 
the portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s assessment of market conditions  weather  operational  and other factors 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  historical price relationships  and credit exposure 
however  it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording derivative assets and liabilities subject to mark to market accounting  and such variations could be material 
power  gas  coal  and other related commodity trading risks involve the potential decline in net income or financial condition due to adverse changes in market prices  whether arising from customer activities  generating plants  or proprietary positions taken by the company 
we assess and monitor market risk with a variety of tools  including evar  var  scenario analysis  and stress testing 

table of contents evar evar measures the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of the merchant energy business due to changes in market risk factors 
evar is a one day value at risk measure calculated at a confidence level assuming a standard normal distribution of prices over the most recent rolling month period 
evar includes all positions over a forward rolling month time horizon that expose us to market price risk  regardless of accounting treatment and business line 
positions included in evar are comprised of all positions  regardless of accounting treatment  that create market risk including derivative and nonderivative commodity contracts associated with our generation  customer supply  and global commodities operations  physical assets  such as our owned and contractually controlled generating plants  and our share of investments in generating plants 
we include the positions related to physical assets to provide a more complete presentation of our commodity market risk exposures 
evar includes illiquid products and positions for which there is limited price discovery 
modeling the positions in our generation and customer supply operations involves a number of assumptions  and includes projections of generation  emission rates and costs  customer load growth  load response to weather  and customer response to competitive supply 
changes in our forecast or management estimates will affect the fair value of these positions in a manner not captured by evar 
evar reflects the risk of loss due to market prices under normal market conditions 
an inherent limitation of our value at risk measures is the reliance on historical prices 
a sudden shift in market conditions can cause the future behavior of market prices to differ materially from the past 
we use stress tests and scenario analysis to better understand extreme events as a complement to evar 
this includes exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets  sensitivity to changes in management projections of customer demand or forecasted generation output  and price sensitivity to illiquid points and regional basis spreads 
evar is monitored daily and is subject to regional and overall guidelines for the customer supply operations 
we place guidelines on the risk associated with illiquid delivery locations and regional basis within our customer supply operation 
additionally  we monitor generation plant hedge ratios relative to guidelines specified by management 
stress tests and scenario analysis are conducted regularly and the results  trends  and explanations are reviewed by senior management and risk committees 
the evar amounts below represent the potential pre tax change in the fair values of our merchant energy business positions over a one day holding period 
evar for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average n a high n a low n a n a average  high  and low amounts for are not available as we did not begin computing those categories of evar until the fourth quarter of at december   our evar was approximately million  which represents a decline from its level of million on december   mainly due to de risking activities and the closing of the edf transaction in the last quarter of the year 
var var measures the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of mark to market energy contracts due to changes in market risk factors 
var is a one day value at risk measure calculated at a confidence level assuming a standard normal distribution of prices over the most recent rolling month period 
var includes all positions subject to mark to market accounting  including contracts that hedge the economics of customer supply nonderivative power and fuel contracts  but which do not receive hedge accounting treatment  but also contracts designated for trading 
thus  the positions for which we monitor var are included within  and are not incremental  to the positions subject to evar 
var and evar have similar limitations 
var may include some products and positions for which there is limited price discovery or market depth 
the modeling of option positions included in var involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
an inherent limitation of our var measures is the reliance on historical prices 
a sudden shift in market conditions can cause the future behavior of market prices to differ materially from that of the past 
the var amounts below represent the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of our merchant energy business positions subject to mark to market accounting  including both trading and non trading activities  over one and ten day holding periods 
during  confidence level  one day holding period mark to market var represented in the table below ranged between a high of million in the beginning of the year and a low of million towards the end of the year 
despite the wide range of values during  mark to market var has been declining steadily throughout the year  consistent with our de risking efforts 
while de risking activities were the main contributor to the declining level of mark to market var  this metric will continue to be impacted by the volatility of commodity prices and by the size of mark to market positions of our non trading activities 

table of contents total mark to market var for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  ten day holding period year end average high low constellation energy s proprietary trading activities are substantially reduced from previous years and are now immaterial 
these activities continue to be managed with daily var limits  stop loss limits and position limits 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt and certain related interest rate swaps 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
in july  to optimize the mix of fixed and floating rate debt  we entered into interest rate swaps relating to million of our long term debt 
these fair value hedges effectively convert our current fixed rate debt to a floating rate instrument tied to the three month london inter bank offered rate 
in july  we terminated an interest rate swap relating to million of the million of fixed rate debt 
including the million in interest rate swaps  approximately of our long term debt is floating rate 
we discuss our use of derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date thereafter total fair value at december  dollars in millions long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate a fixed rate debt average interest rate a interest on variable rate debt is included based on the forward curve for interest rates at december  security price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in financial markets primarily through our pension plan assets 
in  our actual gain on pension plan assets was million 
we describe our pension funding requirements in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk our merchant energy business is exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this foreign currency risk arises from our activities in countries where we transact in currencies other than the us dollar 
in  our exposure to foreign currency risk was not material 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk using a foreign currency hedging program 
we will continue to have limited exposure to the canadian dollar due to our canadian gas and power operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk through our merchant energy business and bge s operations 
credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparties nonperformance and retail customer accounts receivable and forward value payment risk arising from contracted power and gas supply agreements 
we evaluate our credit risk as discussed below 
wholesale credit risk we measure wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative transactions both mark to market and accrual adjusted for amounts owed to or due from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
we monitor and manage the credit risk of our global commodities operation through credit policies and procedures  which include an established credit approval process  daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits  the use of credit 
table of contents mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  or prepayment arrangements  and the use of master netting agreements 
as of december  and  counterparties in the credit portfolio of our global commodities operation had the following public credit ratings at december  rating investment grade non investment grade not rated includes counterparties with an investment grade rating by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
if split rating exists  the lower rating is used 
our exposure to not rated counterparties was billion at december  and december  many of our not rated counterparties are considered investment grade equivalent based on our internal credit ratings 
we utilize internal credit ratings to evaluate the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers  including those companies that do not have public credit ratings 
based on internal credit ratings  approximately billion or of the exposure to unrated counterparties was rated investment grade equivalent at december  and approximately billion or was rated investment grade equivalent at december  the following table provides the breakdown of the credit quality of our wholesale credit portfolio based on our internal credit ratings 
at december  investment grade equivalent non investment grade equivalent our total exposure  net of collateral  to counterparties across our entire wholesale portfolio is billion as of december  the top ten counterparties account for approximately of our total exposure with approximately of that exposure being non investment grade 
if a counterparty were to default on its contractual obligations and we were to liquidate transactions with that entity  our potential credit loss would include all forward and settlement exposure plus any additional costs related to termination and replacement of the positions 
this would include contracts accounted for using the mark to market  hedge  and accrual accounting methods  the amount owed or due from settled transactions  less any collateral held from the counterparty 
in addition  if a counterparty were to default under an accrual contract that is currently favorable to us  we may recognize a material adverse impact on our results in the future delivery period to the extent that we are required to replace the contract that is in default with another contract at current market prices 
to reduce our credit risk with counterparties  we attempt to enter into agreements that allow us to obtain collateral on a contingent basis  seek third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligation  and enter into netting agreements that allow us to offset receivables and payables with forward exposure across many transactions 
as of december   our total exposure of billion  net of collateral  includes accrual positions and derivatives 
this total exposure has declined significantly from the billion as of december   as a result of our de risking activities and divestitures and changes in commodity prices 
of our billion total exposure at december   less than billion is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
immediately preceding the edf transaction  our global commodities operation entered into long term ppa agreements with ceng  creating a counterparty exposure net of payables owed exceeding of our total credit exposure 
we discuss our counterparty credit risk in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
other than the exposure to ceng  no single counterparty concentration comprises more than of the total exposures recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  due to volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the power our global commodities operation had contracted for  we could incur a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
if a counterparty were to default and we were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  our credit loss would include the loss in value of derivative contracts recorded at fair value  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  that we would have to make to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
in addition  if a counterparty were to default under an accrual contract that is currently favorable to us  we may recognize a material adverse impact in our results in the future delivery period to the extent that we are required to replace the contract that is in default with another contract at current market prices 
these potential losses would be limited to the extent that the in the money amount exceeded any credit mitigants such as cash  letters of credit  or parental guarantees supporting the counterparty obligation 
we also enter into various wholesale transactions through isos 
these isos are exposed to counterparty credit risks 
any losses relating to counterparty defaults impacting the isos are allocated to and borne by all other market participants in the iso 
these isos have established credit policies and practices to mitigate the exposure of counterparty credit risks 
as a market participant  we continuously assess our exposure to the credit risks of each iso 
bge is exposed to wholesale credit risk of its suppliers for electricity and gas to serve its retail customers 
bge may receive performance assurance collateral to mitigate electricity suppliers credit risks in certain circumstances 
performance assurance collateral is designed to protect bge s potential exposure over the term of the supply contracts and will fluctuate to reflect changes in market prices 
in addition to the collateral provisions  there are supplier step up provisions  where other suppliers can 
table of contents step in if the early termination of a full requirements service agreement with a supplier should occur  as well as specific mechanisms for bge to otherwise replace defaulted supplier contracts 
all costs incurred by bge to replace the supply contract are to be recovered from the defaulting supplier or from customers through rates 
retail credit risk we are exposed to retail credit risk through our competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities  which serve commercial and industrial companies and governmental entities  and through bge s electricity and natural gas distribution operations 
retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations or fail to pay for service rendered 
this risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances  as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve customers of our nonregulated retail businesses 
retail credit risk is managed through established credit approval policies  monitoring customer exposures  and the use of credit mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements 
in addition  we have taken steps to augment our credit staff in response to current economic conditions 
retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
our retail credit portfolio is diversified with no significant company  geographic  or industry concentrations 
in  reserve levels had been increased across our retail businesses due to indicators of deteriorating credit quality and macroeconomic slowdown 
in the first half of  the overall incidence of customer bankruptcies increased  but had moderated to more historic levels by year end 
sectors most susceptible to financial stress were concentrated in consumer cyclical industries and commercial real estate 
as a result  we have increased our reserve levels accordingly 
we have also augmented our credit risk organization with a dedicated credit workout function 
bge is subject to retail credit risk associated with both the delivery portion of a customer s bill as well as on the uncollectible expense or credit risk from the gas and or electric commodity portion of the bills of those customers to whom bge sells the gas and electric commodity 
although both bge s delivery and commodity rates include some level of costs for uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses  full recovery is contingent on amounts approved by the maryland psc in customer rates and  therefore is not guaranteed and bge is exposed to these potential losses and related carrying costs 
operational risk operational risk is the risk associated with human error or a failure of our processes and systems  or external factors 
we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders  clerical and record keeping errors  and computer systems malfunctions 
in addition  we may also be subject to disruptions in our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  such as natural disasters  acts of terrorism  and computer viruses  which may give rise to losses in service to customers and or monetary losses to us 
we own  have direct and indirect ownership interests in  and or operate a number of power generation facilities  which utilize a diverse mix of fuel sources to include coal  gas  oil  hydro  biomass  and nuclear 
we are exposed to risk resulting from generating plants not being available to produce energy and the risks related to physical delivery of energy to meet our customers needs 
if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sales commitments through the operation of other more costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
we purchase electricity from generating facilities we do not own 
if one or more of those generating facilities were unable to produce electricity due to operational factors  we may be forced to purchase electricity in the wholesale market at higher prices 
this could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
ceng  an entity in which we own a membership interest  owns nuclear plants 
these nuclear plants produce electricity at a relatively low marginal cost 
nine mile point unit and the ginna facility sell approximately of their respective output under unit contingent power purchase agreements ceng has no obligation to provide power if the units are not available to the previous owners 
however  if an unplanned outage were to occur at calvert cliffs during periods when demand was high  ceng may have to purchase replacement power at potentially higher prices to meet their obligations  which could have a material adverse impact on ceng s and our financial results 
we are exposed to the risk that available sources of supply may differ from the amount of power demanded by our customers under fixed price load serving contracts 
during periods of high demand  our power supplies may be insufficient to serve our customers needs and could require us to purchase additional energy at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand  our electricity supplies may exceed our customers needs and could result in us selling that excess energy at lower prices 
either of those circumstances could have a negative impact on our financial results 
we are also exposed to variations in the prices and required volumes of natural gas  oil  and coal we burn at our power plants to generate electricity 
therefore  high commodity prices increase the impact of generator outages and variable load  but as long as the electricity and fuel prices move in tandem  we have limited exposure to changing commodity prices 
during periods of high demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may be insufficient and could require us to procure additional fuel at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand on our generation assets  our fuel supplies may exceed our needs  and could result in us selling the excess fuels 
table of contents at lower prices 
either of these circumstances will have a negative impact on our financial results 
funding liquidity risk funding liquidity risk relates to the ability to fund current and future obligations of the company given variability in collateral requirements as well as variability around working capital requirements and other cash flows that may affect our liquidity 
to assess funding liquidity risk  we distinguish between sources and uses of liquidity 
sources of liquidity include projected net available cash  the unused capacity available from our credit facilities  and any availability under the edf put arrangement through december  uses include expected and contingent collateral requirements as well as any unexpected variation of cash flows from projected levels 
we define contingent requirements to be any incremental or decremental requirements to expected requirement levels 
to manage liquidity risk  we quantify sources of liquidity and the expected and contingent uses of liquidity both over a short term and long term horizon 
contingent uses of liquidity are determined by stress testing our portfolio using a simulation of extreme  adverse price stresses and measuring their combined impact on collateral needs and on cash flows related to losses due to market and credit risk 
liquidity stresses related to operational risks weather  plant outages and other business risks not directly linked to price moves are assessed on a regular basis using scenario analysis 
results of the liquidity assessment are shared regularly with senior management 
liquidity risk assessment has been integrated into our strategic planning process 
expected and contingent funding needs implied by the business plans of our various business units are first aggregated and compared to available liquidity sources over the planning horizon 
capital and liquidity sources are then allocated to business units based on their business plans  taking into account the cost of providing liquidity 
we believe that this integrated view on sources and uses of liquidity allows us to ensure proper funding of the business in accordance with our business plan
