overview we are a global asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of boutique investment management firms our affiliates 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing business  additional investments in boutique investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
through our affiliates  we manage approximately billion in assets as of december  pro forma for our pending investments  we manage approximately billion in assets as of december  in more than investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
we believe that our diversification across asset classes  investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments 
the following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels 
in the mutual fund distribution channel  our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to more than mutual funds 
these funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisors  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 

table of contents in the institutional distribution channel  our affiliates offer approximately investment products across approximately different investment styles  including small  small mid  mid and large capitalization value  growth equity and emerging markets 
in addition  our affiliates offer quantitative  alternative  credit arbitrage and fixed income products 
through this distribution channel  our affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities  and taft hartley plans  with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of two principal client groups 
the first group consists principally of direct relationships with high net worth individuals and families and charitable foundations 
for these clients  our affiliates provide investment management or customized investment counseling and fiduciary services 
the second group consists of individual managed account client relationships established through intermediaries  generally brokerage firms or other sponsors 
our affiliates provide investment management services through approximately managed account and wrap programs 
we operate our business through our affiliates in our three principal distribution channels  maintaining each affiliate s distinct entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure 
in making investments in boutique investment management firms  we seek to partner with the highest quality firms in the industry  with outstanding management teams  strong long term performance records and a demonstrated commitment to continued growth and success 
fundamental to our investment approach is the belief that affiliate management equity ownership along with amg s ownership aligns our interests and provides affiliate managers with a powerful incentive to continue to grow their business 
our investment structure provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique investment management firms  while at the same time expanding equity ownership opportunities among the firm s management and allowing management to continue to participate in the firm s future growth 
our partnership approach also ensures that affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their business  thereby preserving their firm s entrepreneurial culture and independence 
although the specific structure of each investment is highly tailored to meet the needs of a particular affiliate  in all cases  amg establishes a meaningful equity interest in the firm  with the remaining equity interests retained by the management of the affiliate 
each affiliate is organized as a separate firm  and its operating or shareholder agreement is structured to provide appropriate incentives for affiliate management owners and to address the affiliate s particular characteristics while also enabling us to protect our interests  including through arrangements such as long term employment agreements with key members of the firm s management team 
in most cases  we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm and structure a revenue sharing arrangement  in which a percentage of revenue is allocated for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
the portion of the affiliate s revenue that is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including us is called the owners allocation 
each affiliate allocates its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate 
however  should actual operating expenses exceed the operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers until that portion is eliminated  before reducing the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may 
table of contents increase their compensation from both the operating allocation and the owners allocation 
these arrangements also provide incentives to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation that is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
as one measure of these incentives  in  approximately million of compensation and profits were allocated to our affiliate managers reported in compensation expense and non controlling interest 
our minority investments are also structured to align our interests with those of the affiliate s management through shared equity ownership  as well as to preserve the affiliate s entrepreneurial culture and independence by maintaining the affiliate s operational autonomy 
in cases where we hold a minority investment  the revenue sharing arrangement generally allocates a percentage of the affiliate s revenue to us 
the remaining revenue is used to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners 
certain of our affiliates operate under profit based arrangements through which we own a majority of the equity in the firm and receive a share of profits as cash flow  rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
in these cases  we participate in a budgeting process and generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the affiliate 
we are focused on establishing and maintaining long term partnerships with our affiliates 
our shared equity ownership gives both amg and our affiliate partners meaningful incentives to manage their businesses for strong future growth 
from time to time  we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an affiliate in order to better support the firm s growth strategy 
through our affiliated investment management firms  we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management  most asset based advisory fees are billed by our affiliates quarterly 
certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
most client accounts in the high net worth distribution channel are billed in advance  and most client accounts in the institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears 
clients in the mutual fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period but may reflect changes due to client withdrawals 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  over affiliate alternative investment and equity products  representing approximately billion of assets under management as of december   also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance performance fees 
these products  which are primarily in the institutional distribution channel  are often structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and  if earned  the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than an asset based fee 
although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period  we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue 
we also anticipate that  within any calendar year  the majority of performance fees will typically be realized in the fourth quarter 
for certain of our affiliates  generally where we own a minority investment  we are required to use the equity method of accounting 
consistent with this method  we have not consolidated the operating results of these firms including their revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
our share of these firms profits net of intangible amortization is reported in income from equity method investments  and is therefore reflected in our net income and ebitda 
as a consequence  increases 
table of contents or decreases in these firms assets under management which totaled billion as of december  will not affect reported revenue in the same manner as changes in assets under management at our other affiliates 
our net income reflects the revenue of our consolidated affiliates and our share of income from affiliates which we account for under the equity method  reduced by our expenses  including the operating expenses of our consolidated affiliates  and the profits allocated to managers of our consolidated affiliates ie  non controlling interest 
as discussed above  for consolidated affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  the operating expenses of the affiliate as well as its managers non controlling interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
at our consolidated profit based affiliates  expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the affiliates revenues 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including those affecting the global financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  our receipt of owners allocation from affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of affiliates that operate on a profit based model  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of our expenses  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
results of operations the following tables present a rollforward of our affiliates reported assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k

other includes assets under management attributable to affiliate product closings and transfers of our interest in certain affiliated investment management firms 
as shown in the assets under management table above  client cash inflows totaled billion while client cash outflows totaled billion for the year ended december  the net flows for the year ended december  occurred across a broad range of product offerings in each of our distribution channels  with no individual cash inflow or outflow having a material impact on our revenue or expenses 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management generally represents an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management represents an average of the assets at the beginning and end of each calendar quarter during the applicable period 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue

note to the consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain investments and as such do not consolidate their revenue for financial reporting purposes 
our share of profits from these investments is reported in income from equity method investments and is therefore reflected in net income and ebitda 
the definition of ebitda and our reasons for using ebitda are presented in note on page our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources 
percentage change is not meaningful 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management  the portion of our assets across our products and three operating segments  which realize different fee rates  and the recognition of any performance fees 
as described in the overview section above  performance fees are generally measured on absolute or relative investment performance against a benchmark 
as a result  the level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in assets under management 

table of contents our revenue decreased million or in from  primarily as a result of a decrease in average assets under management 
the decrease in average assets under management resulted principally from the decline in global equity markets in and negative net client cash flows

the decrease in average assets resulted principally from the decline in global equity markets in  partially offset by our and investments in new affiliates 
the decline in revenue was proportionately greater than the decline in average assets under management as a result of the effects of advance billing  and the increase in assets under management that realize comparatively lower fee rates 
our revenue decreased million or in from primarily as a result of a decrease in average assets under management 
the decrease in average assets under management resulted principally from investment performance  partially offset by our investment in a new affiliate

operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses the substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  the majority of which is incurred by affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
accordingly  our compensation expense is generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate s revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective operating allocations 
during  approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to our affiliate managers 
the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and may vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
compensation and related expenses decreased in and in these decreases were primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced aggregate decreases in revenue and accordingly  reported lower compensation expense 
the decrease in was also attributable to a million decrease in share based compensation resulting from a charge in from senior management s surrender of stock options  which did not recur in the decrease in was also attributable to a million decrease in holding company incentive compensation 
the decreases were partially offset by an increase in share based compensation of million  principally related to senior management s surrender of stock options for no consideration 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in this decrease resulted from a decrease in sub advisory and distribution expenses attributable to a decline in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel  a million decrease in acquisition related professional fees  and million of one time affiliate expenses in  which did not recur in these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from new affiliate investments 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the increase was principally the result of million of one time affiliate expenses and million of acquisition related professional fees reported in these increases were partially offset by affiliate cost cutting initiatives and a million decrease in sub advisory and distribution expenses attributable to a decline in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in principally attributable to a decrease in definite lived intangible assets  partially offset by new affiliate investments in amortization of intangible assets increased in  principally from an increase in definite lived intangible assets resulting from our investments in new and existing affiliates in recent periods 

table of contents depreciation and other amortization was essentially flat in depreciation and other amortization increased in  principally attributable to spending on depreciable assets in recent periods  as well as our investments in new affiliates 
other operating expenses increased in  principally as a result of an increase in the loss realized on the transfer of affiliate interests 
other operating expenses increased in  principally as a result of a loss realized on the transfer of affiliate interests  partially offset by an increase in income from affiliate investments in marketable securities 
other income statement data the following table summarizes non operating income and expense data in millions change change income loss from equity method investments nm nm investment and other income investment income loss from investments in partnerships nm nm interest expense income tax expense percentage change is not meaningful 
income loss from equity method investments consists of our share of income loss from affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  net of any related intangible amortization 
income loss from equity method investments increased substantially in  principally as a result of a million non cash charge in to reduce the carrying value of certain affiliates to their fair values  partially offset by an increase in intangible amortization expense of million 
income loss from equity method investments decreased substantially in  principally as a result of the million non cash charge and decreases in assets under management and revenue attributable to affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
investment and other income decreased in  principally from million of non recurring gains in described further below  partially offset by an increase in affiliate investment earnings as well as a million gain on the settlement of a contingent payment related to our new investment in harding loevner 
investment and other income increased in  principally from a net gain of million realized on the repurchase of a portion of our junior convertible trust preferred securities and a gain of million realized on the settlement of interest rate derivative contracts 
these gains were partially offset by a decrease in affiliate investment earnings as well as million of expenses incurred from the settlement of our mandatory convertible securities and the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities 
investment income loss from affiliate investments in partnerships relates to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates serve as the general partner 
we are required to consolidate certain affiliate investment partnerships including interests in the partnerships in which we do not have ownership rights in our consolidated financial statements 
for and  the income loss from affiliate investments in partnerships was million and million  respectively  which was principally attributable to investors who are unrelated to us 
interest expense decreased in  principally attributable to a million decrease from a decline in borrowings  a million decrease from the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities and the settlement of our mandatory convertible securities in and a million decrease resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our junior convertible trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of these decreases were partially offset by an increase 
table of contents of million attributable to the issuance of our senior convertible notes in the third quarter of interest expense decreased in  principally attributable to a million decrease resulting from the conversion of our floating rate senior convertible securities and the settlement of our mandatory convertible securities and a million decrease in the cost of our senior bank debt resulting from a decline in libor interest rates 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase from the issuance of our junior convertible trust preferred securities in and a million increase from the issuance of our senior convertible notes 
income taxes increased in principally as a result of the increase in net income controlling interest 
this increase was offset by million of benefits realized from the restructuring of certain affiliate relationships  a million reduction in valuation allowances on state net operating losses and a charge to revalue our deferred tax liabilities for changes in massachusetts tax laws  which did not recur in income taxes decreased in principally as a result of the decrease in net income controlling interest 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in income taxes of million related to the one time revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of new massachusetts tax legislation 
net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years in millions change change net income net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships nm nm net income non controlling interests net income loss controlling interest nm nm percentage change is not meaningful

net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships relates to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates are the general partner 
in and  the net income loss from affiliate investment partnerships attributable to the non controlling interests was million  and million  respectively 
net income non controlling interest decreased in and in these changes were principally as a result of the previously discussed changes in revenue 
in  the decrease in income attributable to non controlling interest was proportionately greater than the decrease in revenue as a result of affiliate equity repurchases that had the effect of decreasing affiliate equity ownership 
in  the decrease in income attributable to non controlling interests was proportionately greater than the decrease in revenue as a result of the decrease in affiliate investment income 
net income controlling interest increased substantially in  after decreasing substantially in the increase in was principally the result of the increase in income from equity method investments and a decrease in operating expenses  partially offset by a decrease in revenue and income attributable to non controlling interests 
the decrease in was principally as a result of the decrease in revenue and the loss from equity method investments  and was partially offset by an increase in investment and other income as well as decreases in reported operating  non controlling interest and tax expenses  as described above 

table of contents supplemental performance measures as supplemental information  we provide non gaap performance measures that we refer to as cash net income and cash earnings per share 
these measures are provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income controlling interest and earnings per share 
we believe these supplemental performance measures best represent our operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our affiliates 
cash net income and cash earnings per share are used by our management and board of directors as our principal performance benchmarks  including as measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
under our cash net income definition  we add to net income controlling interest amortization including equity method amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and affiliate depreciation and equity expenses  and exclude the effects of recent accounting changes related to our convertible debt apb  which we adopted in since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement by us  and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse  we add back these non cash expenses to net income to measure operating performance 
we add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back  because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations 
we add back non cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between affiliate management partners  when these transfers have no dilutive effect to our shareholders 
we add back the portion of consolidated depreciation expense incurred by our affiliates because under our affiliates operating agreements we are generally not required to replenish these depreciating assets 
cash earnings per share represents cash net income divided by the adjusted diluted average shares outstanding  which measures the potential share issuance from our senior convertible securities and junior convertible securities each further described in liquidity and capital resources using a treasury stock method 
under this method  only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these securities in excess of par  if any  are deemed to be outstanding 
we believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation 
this method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion

our share of these investments amortization is reported in income loss from equity method investments 
in connection with accounting changes adopted in  we modified our cash net income definition to add back non cash charges related to certain affiliate equity transfers referred to as affiliate equity expense and apb expense both net of tax 
in prior periods  cash net income was defined as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes relating to intangible assets plus affiliate depreciation 
under this prior definition  cash net income reported in and was million and million  respectively 
cash net income decreased in primarily as a result of the decreases in revenue  partially offset by an increase in investment and other income as well as decreases in reported operating  non controlling interest and tax expenses  as previously described

consistent with industry practice  we do not consider junior trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our internal leverage ratio 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting from our debt balance holding company cash resources  which include prospective proceeds from the settlement of our forward equity sale agreements as well as holding company cash 
at december   our internal leverage ratio was under the terms of our credit facility we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants 
the first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda the bank leverage ratio of x 
although our bank leverage ratio does not deduct for the prospective proceeds from the settlement of our forward equity sale agreement  the calculation is generally consistent with our internal leverage ratio approach 
the second covenant is a minimum ebitda to cash interest expense ratio of x our bank interest coverage ratio 
as of december   our actual bank leverage and bank interest coverage ratios were x and x  respectively  and we were in full compliance with all terms of our credit facility 
we anticipate our pending investments will close in the second quarter of  and will be financed primarily with borrowings under our credit facility as well as proceeds from the partial settlement of our forward equity arrangement 
we anticipate that our bank leverage and interest coverage ratios will increase and decrease  respectively  following the close of our pending new investments 
we are rated bbb by standard poor s 
a downgrade of our credit rating  either as a result of industry or company specific considerations  would not have a material financial effect on any of our agreements or securities or otherwise trigger a default 
supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we provide information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from 
table of contents operating activities 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry

both the and junior convertible trust preferred securities are convertible  at any time  into a defined number of shares 
upon conversion  holders will receive cash or shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof 
we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities on or after april if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities on or after october if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
holders of the and junior trust preferred securities have no rights to put these securities to us 
forward equity sale agreements we have entered into three forward equity sale agreements with major securities firms to sell shares of our common stock up to million under each agreement 
under the terms of these agreements  we can settle forward sales at any time prior to december  by issuing shares in exchange for cash 
alternatively  we may choose to settle forward sales on a net stock or cash basis 
through december   we have completed million of forward sales 
in march  we settled million of forward equity sales by issuing million shares of our common stock 
the weighted average exercise price of our forward equity sales that remain unsettled is 

table of contents a summary of our forward equity sale agreements is as follows agreement amount sold amount settled amount unsettled may may july affiliate equity many of our operating agreements provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
certain agreements also provide us a conditional right to require affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests to us upon their death  permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of specified events 
the purchase price of these conditional purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate s cash flow distributions  which is intended to represent fair value 
affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases  subject to our approval or other restrictions 
we may pay for affiliate equity purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration and in all cases can consent to the transfer of these interests to other individuals or entities 
our cumulative redemption obligation for these interests has been presented as redeemable non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in redeemable non controlling interests for the years ended december   and are principally the result of changes to the value of  and repurchases of  these interests 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict  we expect to repurchase approximately million of affiliate equity during  and  in such event  will own the cash flow associated with any equity repurchased 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes  equity based compensation and depreciation  as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in as compared to resulted principally from a decrease in collections of investment advisory fees receivable of million  a decrease in other adjustments of million and a decrease in stock option expense of million 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in as compared to resulted principally from a decrease in earnings and million of increased settlements of liabilities  partially offset by increased collections of investment advisory fees receivable of million 
we consolidate million and million of client assets held in partnerships controlled by our affiliates as of december  and  respectively 
sales of client assets generated million and million of operating cash flow in and  respectively 
investing cash flow changes in net cash flow used in investing activities result primarily from investments in new affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments in new affiliates was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these investments were primarily funded with borrowings under our credit facility and existing cash 

table of contents as discussed above in pending investments  we have three pending acquisitions 
in december  we announced an agreement to acquire a majority equity interest in aston through the acquisition of highbury financial inc in february  we announced agreements to purchase artemis and pantheon see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment in aston will be financed through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock  while our artemis and pantheon investments will be financed with borrowings under the revolver and proceeds from the partial settlement of forward equity sales 
financing cash flow net cash flows used in financing activities decreased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of the settlement of a forward equity arrangement of million in the period and a decrease in issuance costs of million  partially offset by a million decrease in the distributions to non controlling interests 
net cash flows used in financing activities increased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of a net repayment of senior bank debt of million combined with million settlement of convertible securities  partially offset by a million decrease in the repurchases of common stock 
in addition  we issued million of senior convertible notes in and repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our junior convertible trust preferred securities for million 
as more fully discussed above  during  we retired the outstanding floating rate convertible securities and issued approximately million shares of common stock 
additionally  we repurchased the outstanding senior notes component of our prides 
the repurchase proceeds were used by the original holders to fulfill their obligations under the related forward equity purchase contracts 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock to settle the forward equity purchase contracts 
excess tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
under past acquisition agreements  we are contingently liable  upon achievement of specified financial targets  to make payments of up to million through in  we expect to make total payments of approximately million to settle portions of these contingent obligations 
in the years ended december   and  we completed additional investments in existing affiliates 
we expect to repurchase about million of interests in certain affiliates in we anticipate that borrowings under the revolver and proceeds from the partial settlement of forward equity sales  together with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due contractual obligations total thereafter in millions senior convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities leases other liabilities total the timing of debt payments assumes that outstanding debt is settled for cash or common stock at the applicable maturity dates 
the amounts include the cash payment of fixed interest 
as more fully discussed on page  consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
other liabilities reflect amounts payable to affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests 
this table does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions million as of december  as we cannot predict when such liabilities will be paid 
market risk our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on assets under management 
such values are affected by changes in financial markets  and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
the broader financial markets are affected  in part  by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we have fixed rates of interest on our zero coupon senior convertible notes  our senior convertible notes and on both issues of our junior convertible trust preferred securities 
we pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facility with no borrowings outstanding as of december  
from time to time  we seek to manage our exposure to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately million 
we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
the valuations of our foreign affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which could be recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
to illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates  as of december   we estimate that a change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate would result in approximately a million change to stockholders equity and a million change to income before income taxes 
during  changes in currency exchange rates decreased stockholders equity by million 

table of contents recent accounting developments we have adopted the financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification the codification  which is now the single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap recognized by the fasb 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature not included in the codification is nonauthoritative 
the adoption of the codification had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a standard that requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
under the standard  an enterprise has a controlling financial interest when it has a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
an enterprise that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
this standard is effective beginning in the first quarter of in february  the fasb deferred this standard for certain entities that apply the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies or that have the attributes of investment companies 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact that this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a standard that eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets  and requires additional disclosures to enhance information reported to users of financial statements by providing greater transparency about transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions  and an entity s continuing involvement in and exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets 
the standard also clarifies the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting 
the standard is effective beginning in we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued a standard regarding fair value measurements and disclosures for alternative investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent 
this standard permits  but does not require  us to measure the fair value of an alternative investment on the basis of the net asset value per share if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a manner consistent with established measurement principles as of our measurement date 
this standard is effective beginning in we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting estimates and judgments 
these policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 

table of contents these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
we make judgments regarding the determination of fair value in allocating the purchase price of our investments and testing our assets for impairment 
we make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of our acquired client relationships  operating segments and equity method investments 
we also assess the value of non controlling interests held by our affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer 
in these valuations  we make assumptions about the growth rates and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts  as well as future earnings  valuation multiples  tax benefits  credit risk and discount rates 
we consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to market transactions  and in certain instances engage third party consultants to perform independent evaluations 
if we used different assumptions  the effect may be material to our financial statements  as the carrying value of our intangible assets and related amortization and equity method investments could be stated differently and result in different impairment conclusions 
the use of different assumptions to value our non controlling interests could change the amount of compensation expense  if any  we report upon their transfer or repurchase 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions and the fair value of any non controlling interest over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities 
our goodwill impairment tests are performed annually during the third quarter at the reporting unit level in our case  our three operating segments  or more frequently  should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter and no impairments were identified and no events have required us to update our assessments 
for purposes of our test  the fair value of each reporting unit was measured by applying a market multiple to the estimated cash flow of the reporting unit  including cash flows attributable to non controlling interests 
management believes that the valuation inputs used to determine fair value of our reporting units are reasonable 
the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds their respective carrying values  the fair values of the mutual fund  high net worth and institutional reporting units are approximately  and greater than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the value of any of our reporting units would indicate that an impairment may exist 
indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts with registered investment companies that are sponsored by our affiliates 
we do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
each quarter  we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate these relationships might have a definite life 
we perform indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
in this test we compare the carrying amount of each asset to its fair value  measuring value through a discounted cash flow analysis 
the key valuation assumptions include current and projected levels of assets under management in the relevant registered investment company  expenses attributable to these contracts and discount rates 
in the fourth quarter  we performed our impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
the fair value of each of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds their respective carrying value by at 
table of contents least 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets would indicate that an impairment may exist 
definite lived intangible assets definite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts acquired in an affiliate investment 
we monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them  if necessary 
we review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a material impact on our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we perform definite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationship for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired relationships 
in the fourth quarter  we performed our impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of each of these assets exceeds their carrying value by at least 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the undiscounted cash flows underlying these assets would indicate that an impairment may exist 
equity method investments we evaluate equity method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other than temporary 
if we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
we measure the fair value of each of our equity method investments by applying a fair value multiple to estimates of the cash flow 
our fair value multiples are supported by observed transactions and discounted cash flow analyses which reflect assumptions of current and projected levels of affiliate assets under management  fee rates and estimated expenses 
changes in estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the fair value of these investments 
in the fourth quarter  we completed our evaluation of equity method investments and no impairments were identified 
only a decline in excess of approximately in the fair value of certain of our equity method investments for a period considered to be other than temporary would indicate that an impairment may exist 
income taxes tax regulations often require income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements 
deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns 
our overall tax position requires analysis to estimate the expected realization of tax assets and liabilities 
additionally  we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions  and  if so  the appropriate amount of the benefit 
our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and convertible securities 
most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments as cash transactions that are taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes 
table of contents because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
we generally believe that our intangible related deferred tax liabilities are unlikely to be used to settle a cash obligation 
as such  we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these deductions may be permanent 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment 
we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment was approximately million 
during  our convertible securities generated deferred taxes of approximately million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense 
these deferred tax liabilities may be reclassified to equity if the securities convert to common stock 
we regularly assess our deferred tax assets in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
our principal deferred tax assets are state operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
in our assessment  we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
in our assessment of uncertain tax positions  we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain our tax position in an examination 
for tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting this threshold  no benefit is recognized 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans covering directors  senior management and employees 
we recognize share based compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options based on past experience and anticipated future exercise behavior 
in determining expected volatility  we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as the current implied volatility from traded securities 
in measuring volatility  we may place less emphasis on periods that are not representative of our expected future volatility 
our options typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment and do not include performance based or market based vesting conditions 
for grants that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  we recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees as they render services to their clients 
in addition to generating asset based fees  over affiliate products  representing approximately billion of assets under management  also bill on the basis of absolute investment performance performance fees 
our affiliates recognize performance fees when they are earned ie when they 
table of contents become billable to customers based on the contractual terms of agreements and when collection is reasonably assured 
international operations in connection with our international distribution initiatives  we have offices in sydney  australia and london  england and we expect to open an office in hong kong in in addition  we have international operations through affiliates who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non us clients 
in the future  we may open additional offices  or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  different and in some cases  less stringent  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
