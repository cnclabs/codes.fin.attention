at september   cash recorded on the balance sheet was  the contract manufacturing segment s sales are made pursuant to project specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi year terms 
sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases 
the company has contracts for both printing and contract manufacturing 
one of these contract customers  a multinational consumer products company  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the current contract with this customer expires in april another multinational consumer products company accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the current contract with this customer has been extended until june however  because the company s contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements  the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations 
the company replaced its prior credit agreement on march  with a new million unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a termination date of january  on december   the company amended the new credit agreement to  among other things  increase the amount available for borrowing to million and extend its termination date to january  the company s revolving line of credit is classified as a current liability on the accompanying balance sheets because provisions in the credit agreement include deposit account requirements and a material adverse effect covenant which is subjective in nature

inflation in fiscal years and  the impact of inflation was minimal on the company s inventory and net income

prior to these periods  the impact of inflation has been minimal on the company s inventory and operations

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of operations for the company 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue recognition the company only has one type of revenue recognition activity which recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence of an agreement and collectability of consideration to be received is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales 
accounts receivable management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues 
recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
credit terms to customers in the contract manufacturing segment are generally net days 
credit terms to customers in the business imaging segment are generally discounted net terms 
management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
goodwill as previously disclosed  the company tests goodwill annually at the reporting unit level for impairment as of june the operating segments herein also represent the company s reporting units for goodwill purposes 
the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate reporting unit fair values and also considers multiples of relevant companies 
in determining the fair values of the reporting units  the company was required to make certain assumptions and cannot predict what future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of its goodwill 
management has completed the company s annual impairment test and determined there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit at june  however  there can be no assurance that valuation multiples will not decline  growth rates will not be lower than expected  discount rates will not increase  or the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units will not decline 
the company prepared the discounted cash flow analysis in the same manner as in prior years 
the company further updated all significant assumptions in light of current market and regulatory conditions 
the key assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow analysis were projected cash flows  risk of adjusted discount rates  and expected long term growth rates 
because each of the reporting units has distinct characteristics  the company developed these assumptions separately 
any variance in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the evaluation of goodwill impairment 
these assumptions included the company s actual operating results  critical accounting policies continued future business plans  economic projections and market data  as well as estimates by its management regarding future cash flows and operating results 
for example  lower than expected growth or an increase to the discount rate due to changes in risk premiums or other factors may suggest that an impairment has occurred under step and require the company to proceed to step to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
at the annual measurement date of june   the estimated fair value of contract manufacturing exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
the estimated fair value of business imaging exceeded its carrying value by approximately at june  the current discount rate would need to increase for contract manufacturing and increase for business imaging before the company would be required to proceed to step the company recognizes that its common stock regularly trades below book value per share and will continue to monitor the relationship of its market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value 
while management plans to return the company s business fundamentals to levels that support the book value per share  there is no assurance that the plan will be successful  or that the market price of the common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment for disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company determines fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques 
additional information on the company s accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report as referenced to the appendix to this report
