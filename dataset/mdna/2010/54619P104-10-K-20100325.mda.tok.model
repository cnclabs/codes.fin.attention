item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview louisiana bancorp  inc is a louisiana corporation that became the holding company for bank of new orleans in connection with the conversion of the bank in july from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank 
bank of new orleans is a community oriented savings bank headquartered in metairie  louisiana 
we currently operate three banking offices in jefferson and orleans parishes 
our fourth banking office has been closed since hurricane katrina in august  and it is uncertain whether we will re open this office in the future 
during  our loan production office located in hammond  louisiana was closed 
our primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow to originate loans to our customers and invest in mortgage backed and other securities 
at december   we had total assets of million  including million in net loans and million of mortgage backed and other investment securities  total deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
historically  we have operated as a traditional thrift relying primarily on long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans to generate interest income 
during  and  our originations of single family residential mortgage loans totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
the growth in our originations during was due primarily to increased refinancing activity due to a decline in mortgage rates  the bank s hiring of experienced mortgage loan originators during the third quarter of  and the exodus of several national secondary market originators following the mortgage crisis of another significant factor contributing to the growth of our single family originations is the continued repopulation of our market area associated with the hurricane katrina recovery 
approximately six years ago  we determined to revise our lending strategy in order to increase our originations of multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans 
in the aggregate  our originations of these types of loans were million  million  and million  respectively  for the periods ended december   and multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans generate higher levels of interest income than single family residential loans  but are subject to higher levels of risk 
as of december   we had seven loans with an aggregate principal balance of  that were to days delinquent  compared to five loans with an aggregate principal balance of million at december  during  the three largest delinquent loans at december   in the amount of million  were transferred to other real estate owned 
we anticipate that the current national economic crisis will lead to additional job losses in our market area in the next twelve months  and will likely create additional delinquencies 
our non performing loans were million   and  respectively  at december   and total non performing assets were million   and  respectively  at such dates 
the increase in non performing assets between december  and december  was due solely to the additions to other real estate owned referenced earlier in this paragraph 
our total mortgage backed securities and investment securities portfolio was million or of our total assets at december  these securities are comprised of us agency issued obligations and do not include private label securities 
our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by conventional mortgage loans and do not include alt a  sub prime  or other non conforming collateral 
the market value of our securities may decline in the future due to an increase in the level of interest rates 
however  our securities are generally purchased as long term investments  therefore changes in market value during the holding period due to fluctuations in interest rates is expected 
we do not purchase securities for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our total deposits were million  an increase of million from december   and million from december  we attribute these increases to our advertising efforts which have emphasized the strength of our institution  as measured in terms of total capital  and the fdic s temporary increase in their maximum deposit insurance coverage limits to  through december the bank does participate in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program which provides 
table of contents 
index to financial statements unlimited coverage to non interest bearing demand deposits through june  we do not believe the expiration of this program will have a material negative effect on our total deposits 
we have elected to not participate in the fdic s debt guarantee program  which temporarily guarantees certain newly issued unsecured debt through june   due to the liquidity available to us through the deposit market 
our total equity capital at december   was million 
our average equity to average assets ratio was for the period ended december  the bank s capital ratios exceed all regulatory guidelines  and the bank was deemed to be well capitalized as of december  due to the level of capital supporting our balance sheet  the bank elected to not participate in the us treasury s troubled asset relief program 
our results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses  fee income and other non interest income and non interest expense 
non interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion and other expense 
we expect that our non interest expenses will increase as we continue to grow and expand our operations 
in addition  our salaries and benefits expense have increased in recent years due to the stock benefit plans that we implemented following the bank s conversion to the stock form 
for the years ended december   and  the cost of our employee stock ownership plan was   and  respectively 
the esop did not exist in periods prior to july compensation expense related to our stock option plan and recognition and retention awards were  and  during and these equity compensation plans were approved by our shareholders in february our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial conditions and results of operations 
business strategy our business strategy is focused on operating a growing and profitable community oriented financial institution 
below are certain highlights of our business strategy growing our loan portfolio 
we intend to grow our loan portfolio by increasing our originations of residential and commercial mortgage loans through referrals from our branch network and existing customers  increased use of media advertising  and recruiting highly qualified  experienced loan originators 
we may consider the purchase of additional participation interests in loans that meet our underwriting standards 
in addition to facilitating loan growth  such purchases may lessen the geographic concentration of our loans 
expanding our market area 
we intend to pursue opportunities to expand our market area by opening additional banking offices  including loan production offices 
we may consider acquisitions of other financial institutions although we have no current plans  understandings or agreements with respect to any specific acquisitions 
we expect to focus our expansion efforts on contiguous markets to the west of jefferson parish and on the north shore of lake pontchartrain 
maintaining asset quality 
despite the negative effects of hurricane katrina  and more recently  the national recession  we remain committed to our prudent and conservative underwriting practices  and we intend to vigorously review our portfolio for potential problem assets in order to mitigate potential losses 
while the ratio of our non performing assets to total assets increased during  it was only at december

index to financial statements continuing to provide exceptional customer service 
as a community oriented savings bank  we take pride in providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service to our customers that distinguishes us from the large regional banks operating in our market area 
our management team has strong ties to  and deep roots in  the community 
we believe that we know our customers banking needs and can respond quickly to address them 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other sections contained in this report 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for louisiana bancorp  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements 
these policies are described in note a of the notes to our financial statements  which are included in item of this annual report on form k 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of louisiana bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the financial statements require certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that represents the amount of probable and reasonably estimable known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans  and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  exposure at default  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios and general amounts for historical loss experience 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance 
historically  our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have not required significant adjustments from management s initial estimates 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of its examination processes  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the office of thrift supervision may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
we also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision to our initial estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  recent cumulative losses and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
how we manage market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to market risk  our primary risk is credit risk on our loan portfolio 
we attempt to manage credit risk through our loan underwriting and oversight policies 
the principal objective of our interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
we seek to manage our exposure to risks from changes in interest rates while at the same time trying to improve our net interest spread 
we monitor interest rate risk as such risk relates to our operating strategies 
we have established an asset liability committee alco investment committee  which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller and two outside directors  and which is responsible for reviewing our asset liability and investment policies and interest rate risk position 
the alco investment committee meets on a regular basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on future earnings 
in recent years  we primarily have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have increased our originations of shorter term loans particularly multi family residential  commercial real estate and land loans  we have attempted to match fund a portion of our loan portfolio with borrowings having similar expected lives  on occasion  we have sold long term year fixed rate mortgage loans which had been classified as held for sale  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits and borrowings  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally three to five years  and we hold significant amounts of liquid assets 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income 
our one year cumulative gap was a positive at december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the following table sets forth the amounts of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we expect  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities of the bank at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
months or less more than months to months more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years total amount dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable investment securities mortgage backed securities other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities passbook accounts checking accounts money market accounts certificate accounts borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate gap as a percentage of total assets at december  cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities at december  interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we prepare these models in collaboration with a third party asset liability management consultant  and present them to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
in addition to our internal npv calculation  the office of thrift supervision ots prepares a quarterly calculation based on certain repricing and prepayments assumptions that may differ from our internal expectations 
therefore  the results of the ots npv calculation  and our internal calculation  may differ with respect to the magnitude of the change in npv for a given interest rate scenario 
the following table sets forth the npv as of december   as calculated by the ots model  which reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated 
change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp static based on the guidelines found in ots thrift bulletin a tb a  the interest rate risk sensitivity measure for the bank was basis points at december  this sensitivity measure is considered in conjunction with the bank s post shock capital ratio of  in arriving at a minimal level of interest rate risk as per tba 
in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows our nii model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands bp static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  our net interest income for the months ending december  would be expected to decrease by  or to million 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes 
table of contents 
index to financial statements that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
average balances  net interest income  and yields earned and rates paid 
the following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
tax exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis 
all average balances are based on monthly balances 
management does not believe that the monthly averages differ significantly from what the daily averages would be 
year ended december  average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable mortgage backed securities investment securities other interest earning assets total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities passbook  checking and money market accounts certificate accounts total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest earning assets net interest income  average interest rate spread net interest margin average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities includes nonaccrual loans during the respective periods

index to financial statements rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in rate  which is the change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and changes in volume  which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate

this decrease was due to increased prepayments on our mortgage backed securities portfolio  and the sale during the year of million of mortgage backed securities secured by year mortgage loans 
total loans receivable were million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  the growth in our loans receivable was due primarily to a million increase in our portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences  a million increase in loans secured by multifamily and non residential real estate  and a million increase in our home equity loans and lines of credit

comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million  an increase of  from the year ended december  the increase in net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of million resulting primarily from higher average balances of interest earning assets following the company s initial public offering in july  and the wholesale leverage strategies implemented during the impact of the increase in net interest income was partially offset by higher levels of non interest expense related to our esop and our other equity based compensation plans

our equity based compensation plans were approved by our shareholders in february  and therefore was a new component of non interest expense in the increase in other noninterest expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the louisiana bank shares tax and the louisiana corporate franchise tax  which were not applicable prior to our mutual to stock conversion and initial public offering 
the louisiana bank shares tax was  and the louisiana corporate franchise tax was  for the year ended december  the remaining increase in other non interest expense in compared to was due to increased public reporting expenditures and higher levels of professional fees due to our status as a publicly traded company for the entire year in income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to the  increase in pre tax income between the periods  as well as an adjustment to our deferred tax liability of  in the fourth quarter of  which lowered our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are from deposits  amortization of loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
in addition  at such date our available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to an aggregate of million 
we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at december   we had certificates of deposit maturing within the next months amounting to million 
based upon historical experience  we anticipate that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be redeposited with us 
for the year ended december   the average balance of our outstanding fhlb advances and other borrowings was million 
at december   we had million in outstanding fhlb advances and we had million in additional fhlb advances available to us 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to cash flow from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of available for sale securities  we have significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs 
in recent years we have utilized borrowings as a cost efficient addition to deposits as a source of funds 
our borrowings consist primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank of dallas  of which we are a member 
under terms of the collateral agreement with the federal home loan bank  we pledge residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as our stock in the federal home loan bank as collateral for such advances 
we also access funds through reverse repurchase agreements with commercial banks 
these borrowings are typically used to fund purchases of mortgage backed securities at terms more favorable than those available through the federal home loan bank

index to financial statements impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data of louisiana bancorp presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations

further  the new guidance states that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for consistently and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be initially measured at fair value 
the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the company

this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period eps data presented were to be adjusted retrospectively including interim financial statements  summaries of earnings  and selected financial data to conform to the provisions of this guidance
