introduction we offer property and casualty insurance products through our various subsidiaries 
we classify our businesses into two operating segments i insurance operations  which consists of commercial lines commercial lines and personal lines  including our flood line of business personal lines and ii investments 
these segments reflect a change from our historical segments of insurance operations  investments  and diversified insurance services which included federal flood insurance administrative services flood and human resource administration outsourcing hr outsourcing 
in the process of periodically reviewing our operating segments  we reclassified our flood operations in the first quarter of to be included within our insurance operations segment  which reflects the way we are now managing this business 
we believe these reporting changes better enable investors to view us the way our management views our operations and provide more consistency with how our peers report their business 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a plan to dispose of our hr outsourcing segment  which caused the elimination of this operating segment 
the sale of this business was completed in fourth quarter our revised segments are reflected throughout this report for all periods presented
