the net loss available to common shareholders after accruing for preferred stock dividends and discount accretion for was million compared to net income of million in the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the higher provision for credit losses noted above and higher noninterest expense primarily due to increases in fdic expenses and costs related to loan collection efforts 
the net loss per diluted common share was compared to net income of per diluted common share in the primary source of income of the bank is interest on its loan and investment portfolios  while one of the principal expenses of the bank is interest on its deposit accounts and borrowings 
the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities is referred to as net interest income 
net interest income was million for  an increase of million or compared to million in total assets were million as of december   a million or a increase over december  total assets of million 
the company s return on average assets was and for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the company s return on average equity was and for the years ending december   and  respectively 
at december  the bank s gross loan portfolio  including loans held for sale totaled million 
of this amount  million or were commercial loans  million or were commercial real estate loans  million or were construction loans  million or were one to four family residential mortgage loans  million or were home equity loans  and million or were consumer and other loans 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements may reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements which can be found on page and continuing to page these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current 
table of contents economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements found on pages and describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the credit risk management section of this financial analysis

operating results the following discussion outlines some of the more important factors and trends affecting the earnings of the company as presented in its consolidated statements of income 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and is generally affected by increases or decreases in the amount of outstanding interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities volume variance 
this volume variance coupled with changes in interest rates on these same assets and liabilities rate variance equates to the total change in net interest income in any given period 
the table on page sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by the old rate  changes in rates change in rate multiplied by the old volume  and changes in rate volume change in rate multiplied by change in volume 
net interest income for the year ended december   was million  representing an increase of million or from net interest income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income is due primarily to increased average loan and investment security balances and a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities offset by a decrease in the yield on investment securities and loans 
the net interest margin was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the yield on earning assets decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to from for the same periods  respectively

risk management the board of directors is the foundation for effective corporate governance and risk management 
the board demands accountability of management  keeps stockholders and other constituencies interests in focus  advocates the upholding of the company s code of ethics  and fosters a strong internal control environment 
through its audit committee  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including market  credit  liquidity  and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior management manages risk at the business line level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability committee  internal audit and quality control functions 
liquidity risk management and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of the company are met  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
liquidity management also includes ensuring that cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements which comply with regulatory guidance 
the policy is updated at a minimum on a yearly basis 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported monthly to the board of directors 

table of contents deposits  commercial reverse repurchase agreements  and lines of credit are the primary sources of the bank s funds for lending and investing activities 
as of december  the company s deposit and repurchase agreement balances increased million or over december  balances 
at december  the company also had available both secured and unsecured lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and correspondent banks totaling million 
secondary sources of funds are derived from loan repayments and investment maturities 
loan repayments and investment maturities can be considered a relatively stable funding source  while deposit activity is greatly influenced by interest rates  general market conditions and competition 
the bank offers a variety of retail deposit account products to both consumer and commercial deposit customers 
the bank s deposit accounts consist of savings  now accounts  checking accounts  money market accounts and certificate of deposit accounts 
the bank also offers individual retirement accounts 
time deposits comprised of the deposit portfolio at december  core deposits  considered to be noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposit accounts  savings deposits and money market accounts  accounted for of the deposit portfolio at december  this represents a increase in the percentage of core deposits to total deposits 
core deposits accounted for of the deposit portfolio at december  the bank intends to continue to emphasize retail deposit accounts as its primary source of liquidity 
the bank s high yield superior savings product totaled million at december  an increase of from the million in superior savings balances at december  deposit products are promoted in periodic newspaper advertisements  along with notices provided in customer account statements 
the bank s market strategy is based on its reputation as a community bank providing quality products and personal customer service 
the bank pays interest rates on interest bearing deposit products competitive with rates offered by other financial institutions in its market area  and in certain deposit categories may lead the market 
interest rates on deposits are reviewed by management which considers a number of factors including the bank s internal cost of funds  rates offered by competing financial institutions  investing and lending opportunities  and the bank s liquidity position 
jumbo certificates of deposit are accounts of  or more 
these accounts totaled million at december  and consisted principally of time certificates of deposit 
the following table sets forth the amount and maturity of jumbo certificates of deposit at december  three months or less greater than three months to six months greater than six months to one year greater than one year total dollars in thousands securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent transactions with customers for correspondent or commercial account cash management services 
these are overnight borrowing arrangements with interest rates discounted from the federal funds sold rate 
securities underlying the repurchase agreements are maintained in the company s control 
for the years ended december  and  the average cost of these borrowings was and  respectively 
the bank maintains a secured borrowing line with the federal home loan bank fhlb with the potential to draw up to million  and may borrow up to million under secured and unsecured lines established with correspondent commercial banks 
in addition  the bank has the ability to borrow directly from the federal reserve bank discount window 
at december   the bank had advances outstanding of million under the federal home loan bank s convertible advance program and had no borrowings outstanding under its secured and unsecured lines of credit 
potential adverse impacts on liquidity can occur as a result of changes in the estimated cash flows from investment  loan  and deposit portfolios 
the bank manages this inherent risk by maintaining a portfolio of available for sale investments and through secondary sources of liquidity including fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements 
in addition  the bank has the ability to increase its liquidity by raising interest rates on deposit accounts  selling loans in the secondary market or curtailing the volume of loan originations 
the bank maintains the majority of the assets held for liquidity purposes in overnight federal funds and short term interest bearing balances with banks 

table of contents interest rate risk sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of the company s interest earning assets and funding sources 
additionally  the bank s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest bearing assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on its funding sources  such as deposits and borrowings 
accordingly  the bank s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent on movements in market interest rates and its ability to manage its assets in response to such movements 
the bank attempts to manage fluctuations in interest rates by matching the maturities of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the bank s current strategy to manage its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations is to emphasize adjustable rate loans and short and intermediate term fixed rate loans 
to reduce the negative impact of engaging in excessive fixed rate lending in a volatile rate environment  the bank uses a third party for settlement long term fixed rate loans and sells the majority of those loans in the secondary market 
the following table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   and the company s interest sensitivity gap ie  interest earning assets less interest bearing liabilities 
a positive gap for any time period indicates that more interest earning assets will mature or reprice during that period than interest bearing liabilities 
the company s goal is to maintain a cumulative gap position for the period of one year or less of plus or minus fifteen percent in order to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on liquidity  interest margins and operating results 
the actual results show the bank to be negatively gapped cumulatively in the three to twelve month category 
in the current interest rate environment this will allow the company to continue to lower the cost of deposit liabilities

additionally  the company owns  in stock of the federal reserve bank of richmond   in stock of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and a thousand investment in a community development activity qualified mutual fund 

table of contents investment decisions are made within policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
it is the bank s policy to invest in non speculative debt instruments  particularly debt instruments that are guaranteed by the us government or an agency thereof  to maintain a diversified investment portfolio which complements the overall asset liability and liquidity objectives of the bank  while limiting the related credit risk to an acceptable level 
to meet the credit risk objectives  non government debt instruments must have a rating of b or better to be held in the portfolio 
the bank s investment policy designates the investment portfolio to be classified as available for sale  unless otherwise designated 
at december   of the investment portfolio was classified available for sale 
the composition of securities at december for each of the past five fiscal years was dollars in thousands available for sale us agency state and municipal mortgage backed equity securities total securities the following table presents maturities and weighted average yields for investments in available for sale securities and other equity securities

lending activities the types of loans that the bank may originate are subject to federal laws and regulations 
interest rates charged by the bank on loans are affected by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors 
these factors are  in turn  affected by  among other things  economic conditions  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  and legislative tax policies

commercial lending 
the bank offers commercial business loans to businesses operating in the bank s primary market area 
these loans consist of lines of credit  which may require an annual repayment  adjustable rate loans with terms of five to seven 
table of contents years  and fixed rate loans with terms of up to five years 
such loans are generally secured by receivables  inventories  equipment and other assets of the business 
the bank generally requires personal guarantees on its commercial loans 
the bank also offers unsecured commercial loans to businesses on a selective basis 
these types of loans are made to existing customers and are of a short duration  generally one year or less 
the bank also originates commercial loans which are guaranteed by the small business administration 
the bank has been a participant in a variety of sba loan programs 
commercial real estate lending 
the bank originates adjustable rate commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as small office buildings and retail facilities located in the bank s primary market area 
the bank s underwriting procedures provide that commercial real estate loans may generally be made in amounts up to of the lower of the appraised value or sales price of the property  subject to the bank s current loans to one borrower limit  which at december   was million 
these loans may be made with terms up to years if owner occupied and are generally offered at interest rates which adjust annually or annually after an initial three  five or seven year period in accordance with the prime rate  or the and year us constant maturity indices as reported in the wall street journal 
in reaching a decision whether to make a commercial real estate loan  the bank considers the value of the real estate to be financed and the credit strength of the borrower and or the lessee of the real estate project 
the bank has generally required that properties securing commercial real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios of at least loans secured by commercial real estate properties generally involve larger principal amounts and a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards  which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the property s value  debt service coverage ratio  and  under certain circumstances  additional collateral 
the bank generally requires personal guarantees on its commercial real estate loans 
construction lending 
the bank originates construction loans on both one to four family residences and on commercial real estate properties 
the bank originates two types of residential construction loans  consumer and builder 
the bank originates consumer construction loans to build a primary residence  a secondary residence  or an investment or rental property 
the bank will originate builder construction loans to companies engaged in the business of constructing homes for resale 
these loans may be for homes currently under contract for sale  model homes from which other homes will be marketed within a subdivision or  on a very limited basis  homes built for speculative purposes to be marketed for sale during construction 
the bank offers permanent end financing to the bank s construction loan customers generally on a or arm basis 
the bank originates land acquisition and development loans with the source of repayment being either the sale of finished lots or the sale of homes to be constructed on the finished lots 
the bank will originate land acquisition  development  and construction loans on a revolving line of credit basis for subdivisions whereby the borrower may draw upon such line of credit as lots are sold for the purpose of improving additional lots 
construction loans are generally offered with terms up to twelve months for consumer and builder loans  and up to twenty four months for land development loans 
construction loans are generally made in amounts up to of the appraised market value of the security property 
during construction  loan proceeds are disbursed in draws as construction progresses based upon inspections of work in place by independent construction inspectors 
at december   the bank had construction loans  including land acquisition and development loans  totaling million  or of the bank s total loan portfolio  of which million consisted of one to four family residential construction loans  million consisted of commercial real estate construction loans and million consisted of land acquisition and development loans 
construction loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long term financing of improved  owner occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the security property s value upon completion of construction as compared to the estimated costs of construction  including interest 
also  the bank assumes certain risks associated with the borrowers ability to complete construction in a timely and workmanlike manner 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  or if construction is not performed timely or accurately  the bank may be faced with a project which  when completed  has a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment 
one to four family residential mortgage lending 
the bank currently offers both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans  first and second mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences and lot loans for one to four family residences located throughout the baltimore washington metropolitan area 
it is currently the general policy of the bank to originate for sale in the secondary market one to four family fixed rate residential mortgage loans which conform  except as to size  to the underwriting standards of fannie mae and freddie mac  and to originate for investment adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the bank generally does not retain the servicing rights of loans it sells and sells such loans without recourse  with the exception of recourse in the event of breaches in any representations or warranties made by the bank 
the bank recognizes  at the time of sale  the cash gain or loss on the sale of the loans based on the difference between the net cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold 
one to four family loans currently held for sale totaled million at december  one 
table of contents to four family mortgage loan originations are generally obtained from the bank s loan representatives and their contacts in the local real estate industry  direct contacts made by the bank s and the company s directors  existing or past customers  and members of the local communities 
at december   one to four family residential mortgage loans totaled million  or of total loans 
of the one to four family mortgage loans outstanding at that date  million were fixed rate loans with terms of up to fifteen years with a balloon payment at the end of the term  and million were adjustable rate loans with terms of up to years and interest rates which adjust annually from the outset of the loan or which adjust annually after a or year initial period in which the loan has a fixed rate 
the interest rates for the majority of the bank s adjustable rate mortgage loans are indexed to the one year treasury constant maturity index 
interest rate increases on such loans are limited to a annual adjustment cap with a maximum adjustment of over the life of the loan 
the origination of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans  as opposed to fixed rate residential mortgage loans  helps to reduce the bank s exposure to increases in interest rates 
however  adjustable rate loans generally pose credit risks not inherent in fixed rate loans  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payments of the borrower rise  thereby increasing the potential for default 
periodic and lifetime caps on interest rate increases help to reduce the risks associated with the bank s adjustable rate loans  but also limit the interest rate sensitivity of its adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the bank currently originates one to four family residential mortgage loans in amounts typically up to or higher with private mortgage insurance of the lower of the appraised value or the selling price of the property securing the loan 
mortgage loans originated by the bank generally include due on sale clauses which provide the bank with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property without the bank s consent 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the yields on the bank s fixed rate mortgage loan portfolio and the bank has generally exercised its rights under these clauses 
home equity lending 
as of december   home equity loans totaled million  or of the bank s total loan portfolio 
fixed rate  fixed term home equity loans and adjustable rate home equity lines of credit are generally offered in amounts up to of the market value of the security property

the remaining million of the bank s home equity loans are adjustable rate and reprice with changes in the wall street journal prime rate 
consumer lending 
the bank s portfolio of consumer loans primarily consists of adjustable rate  personal lines of credit and generally fixed rate installment loans secured by new or used automobiles  new or used boats  and loans secured by deposit accounts 
at december   consumer loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding 
consumer loans are generally originated in the bank s primary market area 
provision for credit losses and credit risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the type of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and the general economy 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount management considers adequate to cover estimated losses in loans receivable which are deemed probable and estimable based on information currently known to management 
the bank estimates an acceptable allowance for credit loss with the objective of quantifying portfolio risk into a dollar figure of inherent losses  thereby translating the subjective risk value into an objective number 
emphasis is placed on independent external loan reviews and regular internal reviews 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on a combination of the higher of the bank s historical loss experience or the peer group average historical loss experience and ten qualitative factors for specific categories and types of loans 
the combination of the loss experience factor and the total qualitative factors total alll factor is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio for specific categories and types of loans to create the inherent loss index for each loan portfolio 
individual loans deemed impaired are separated from the respective loan portfolios and a specific reserve allocation is assigned based upon bank management s best estimate as to the loss exposure for each loan 
each total alll factor is assigned a percentage weight and that total weight is applied to each loan category 
the total alll factor is different for each loan type and for each risk assessment category within each loan type 
the bank s historical loss experience is calculated by aggregating the actual loan losses by category for the previous eight quarters and converting that total into a percentage for each loan category 

table of contents peer group average loss experience is calculated by averaging the industry loss experience by loan category over the last three full years and the current year to date 
based upon the current economic and industry conditions  bank management has shortened the look back at peer group loss experience to include an average of the last full year and the current year to date 
qualitative factors include levels and trends in delinquencies and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies  the experience  ability and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  concentrations of credit  quality of the bank s loan review system  and  external factors  such as competition  legal and regulatory requirements 
the total allowance for credit losses required thus changes as the percentage weight assigned to each total alll factor is increased or decreased due to its particular circumstance  as the various types and categories of loans change as a percentage of total loans and as the aggregate of specific allowances is adjusted due to an increase or decrease in impaired loans 
management believes this approach effectively measures the risk associated with any particular loan or group of loans 
the bank s board of directors engages an independent loan review consultant to evaluate the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions for estimated credit losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
the bank recorded a total provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december  and million in the aggregate provision was based upon the results of quarterly evaluations using a combination of factors including the level of nonperforming loans  the bank s growth in total gross loans and the bank s net credit loss experience 
total gross loans increased by million for the year ended december  the bank recorded charge offs of million on loans deemed uncollectible and recovered thousand on previously charged off loans 
as of december   the bank s allowance for credit losses was million or of total loans and of nonperforming loans as compared to million  or of total loans and of nonperforming loans as of december  the bank had total nonperforming loans of million at december  and million at december   and nonperforming loans to total loans of and at december  and december   respectively 
the bank places loans on a nonaccrual status after days of not having received contractual principal or interest payments unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
in addition the bank maintains a watch list of loans on a monthly basis that warrant more than the normal level of management supervision 
at december  the bank had approximately million in watch list loans compared to million at december  we continue to experience weaknesses in our residential construction  home equity  commercial mortgage and one to four family residential loan portfolios as loan delinquencies increase  collateral values decline and the potential for foreclosures increases 
general downward economic trends and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs and loans placed on nonaccrual 
at december  million in loans were classified as nonaccrual compared to at december  approximately of the year end nonaccrual total consisted of commercial loans with approximately of the total acquisition and development loans 
commercial mortgages accounted for approximately of the total while one to four family loans totaled  home equity and consumer and installment loans 
the bank continues to monitor and modify its allowance for credit losses as conditions dictate 
while management believes that  based on information currently available  the bank s allowance for credit losses is sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time  no assurances can be given that the bank s level of allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to cover future loan losses incurred by the bank or that future adjustments to the allowance for credit losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from economic and other conditions at the time management determined the current level of the allowance for credit losses 
management may in the future increase the level of the allowance as its loan portfolio increases or as circumstances dictate

nonperforming loans and other delinquent assets management performs reviews of all delinquent loans 
management will generally classify loans as nonaccrual when collection of full principal and interest under the original terms of the loan is not expected or payment of principal or interest has become days past due 
classifying a loan as non accrual results in the company no longer accruing interest on such loan and reversing any interest previously accrued but not collected 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
the company will recognize interest on nonaccrual loans only when received 
as of december  and  the company had and million of nonaccrual loans  respectively 
see the previous discussion under the heading provision for credit losses and credit risk management for additional comments regarding nonaccrual loan activity 
during the third quarter of  management moved a million commercial loan secured by a first lien on the assets of two operating restaurants to nonaccrual status 
at origination  in addition to the first lien on the restaurants  a blanket lien on two life insurance policies with a cash surrender value of million was presented as collateral 
on may   management discovered the life insurance policies were fraudulent 
as of december   the restaurants continue to operate and payments on the outstanding loan balance of million continue to be made under the terms of a forbearance agreement  and 
table of contents will be recognized by the bank on a cash basis pending further developments 
management is evaluating the loan s collateral position and various collection options  including but not limited to  selling the restaurants that collateralize the loan or transferring the loan to individuals who could continue to operate the restaurants and make payments on the loan 
property acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan will be classified as real estate owned 
personal property acquired through repossession will be classified as repossessed assets 
property acquired will be recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
any required write down of the loan to its net realizable value will be charged against the allowance for credit losses 
as of december  the company held million in real estate owned as a result of foreclosure 
the company held no real estate owned at december  property held as the result of repossession totaled thousand at december  and thousand at december  the following table shows the amounts of nonperforming assets at december for the past five years

table of contents capital management total stockholders equity was million at december   representing an increase of million or from december  the growth of stockholders equity during as compared to the same period in was attributable to the infusion of capital under tarp 
under tarp  the us treasury created the cpp  pursuant to which it provides access to capital that will serve as tier capital to financial institutions through a standardized program to acquire preferred stock accompanied by warrants from eligible financial institutions 
on january   the company sold  shares of the company s fixed rate cumulative preferred stock  series a the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share equal to  and a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  at an exercise price of per share  to the treasury under the cpp for a total purchase price of  offsetting the increase in stockholder s equity derived from the tarp was a loss of million  thousand and thousand in preferred stock dividends and accretion  respectively and an increase in the company s accumulated other comprehensive loss of thousand resulting from lower market values of securities available for sale 
stock based compensation  stock purchases through the company s employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of options added thousand to the stockholder s equity for the period ended december  regulatory capital requirements the federal reserve s capital regulations require state member banks to meet two minimum capital standards a tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio the leverage ratio  and an risk based capital ratio 
tier capital is defined as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related paid in capital  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships 
the risk based capital standard requires the maintenance of tier and total capital which is defined as tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least and  respectively 
a well capitalized institution has tier and total capital to risk weighted assets of at least and  respectively and a leverage ratio of at least 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet assets  are multiplied by a risk weight factor of to  as assigned by the federal reserve capital regulations based on the risks the agency believes are inherent in the type of asset 
the regulators have recently added a market risk adjustment to cover a bank s trading account  and foreign exchange and commodity positions 
the components of tier capital are equivalent to those discussed above 
tier capital may include cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt  intermediate preferred stock  and the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
overall  the amount of tier capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed of tier capital 
trust preferred securities are considered regulatory capital for purposes of determining the company s tier capital ratios 
at december   both the company s and the bank s tier and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
the bank was considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes as of december  designation as a well capitalized institution under these regulations is not a recommendation or endorsement of the company or the bank by federal bank regulators 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information on the bank s risk based capital ratios 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services
