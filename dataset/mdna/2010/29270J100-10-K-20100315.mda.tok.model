the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those included in such forward looking statements are set forth under the heading item a risk factors  and our results disclosed from time to time in our reports on forms q and k and our annual reports to stockholders 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are in the business of designing  developing and manufacturing energy recovery devices for sea water reverse osmosis desalination 
our company was founded in and we introduced the initial version of our energy recovery device  the px tm  in early as of december   we had shipped approximately  px devices to desalination plants worldwide 
in december  we acquired pump engineering  llc  which manufactures centrifugal energy recovery devices and high pressure and circulation pumps 
a majority of our net revenue has been generated by sales to large engineering  procurement and construction firms  which are involved with the design and construction of larger desalination plants 
sales to these firms often involve a long sales cycle  which can range from six to months 
a single large desalination project can generate an order for numerous energy recovery devices and generally represents an opportunity for significant revenue 
we also sell our devices to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which commission smaller desalination plants  order fewer energy recovery devices per plant and have shorter sales cycles 
due to the fact that a single order for our energy recovery devices by a large engineering  procurement and construction firm for a particular plant may represent significant revenue  we often experience significant fluctuations in net revenue from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our engineering  procurement and construction firm customers tend to order a significant amount of equipment for delivery in the fourth quarter and  as a consequence  a significant portion of our annual sales typically occurs during that quarter 
a limited number of our customers accounts for a substantial portion of our net revenue 
revenue from customers representing or more of total revenue varies from year to year 
for the year ended december   three customers ide technologies  ltd  acciona agua  and ute mostaganem a consortium of inima and aqualia accounted for approximately   and of our net revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   two customers accounted for approximately and of our net revenue hyflux limited and befesa agua sa including affiliated joint ventures  
table of contents respectively 
for the year ended december   three customers represented approximately  and of our net revenue acciona agua  geida and its member companies  and doosan heavy industries  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  most of our revenue was attributable to sales outside of the united states 
we expect sales outside of the united states to remain a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our revenue is principally derived from the sales of our energy recovery devices 
we also derive revenue from the sale of our high pressure and circulation pumps  which we manufacture and sell in connection with our energy recovery devices for use in desalination plants 
we also receive incidental revenue from the sale of spare parts and from services  such as product support  that we provide to our customers 
the recent acquisition of pump engineering  llc is anticipated to increase revenue derived from sales of energy recovery devices and increase the portion of our revenue derived from the sale of pumps 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial results will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are revenue recognition  warranty costs  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for doubtful accounts and income taxes  and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in demand deposit accounts with large financial institutions and invested in institutional money market funds 
we frequently monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions and institutional money market funds in which we invest our surplus funds 
we have not experienced any credit losses from our cash investments 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer and general economic conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or market 
we calculate inventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels  expected useful life and estimated future demand of the products and spare parts 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and reduced by accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives are generally three to seven years 
we own one building  which is depreciated over an estimated 
table of contents useful life of years 
a portion of the our manufacturing equipment was acquired under capital lease obligations 
these assets are amortized over periods consistent with depreciation of owned assets of similar types  generally five to seven years 
leasehold improvements represent remodeling and retrofitting costs for leased office and manufacturing space and are depreciated over the shorter of either the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease using the straight line method 
software purchased for internal use consists primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third party software providers and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives  generally three to five years 
estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and  when appropriate  changes are made prospectively 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred  whereas improvements and renewals are generally capitalized in their respective property accounts 
when an item is retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and applicable accumulated depreciation are removed and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
acquired intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from one to years 
acquired intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives 
customer relationships and other noncontractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from five to years 
patents developed internally are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful life of to years 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment or when indicators of a potential impairment are present 
the annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans 
as of december   acquired intangibles  including goodwill  relate to the acquisition of pump engineering  llc during the fourth quarter of see note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of intangible assets 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable and accrued expenses  accounts payable  and debt 
the carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the consolidated condensed balance sheets approximate their fair values 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title occurs  fixed pricing is determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
transfer of title typically occurs upon shipment of the equipment pursuant to a written purchase order or contract 
the portion of the sales agreement related to the field services and training for commissioning of a desalination plant is deferred using the residual value method 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements  assuming that the delivered elements have stand alone value 
vendor objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements is based upon the price we charge for such product or service when it is sold separately 
we may modify our pricing in the future  which could 
table of contents result in changes to our vendor objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements 
the services element of our contracts represents an incidental portion of the total contract price 
under our revenue recognition policy  evidence of an arrangement has been met when it has an executed purchase order or a stand alone contract 
typically  smaller projects utilize purchase orders that conform to standard terms and conditions that require the customer to remit payment generally within to days from product delivery 
in some cases  if credit worthiness cannot be determined  prepayment is required from the smaller customers 
for large projects  stand alone contracts are utilized 
for these contracts  consistent with industry practice  our customers typically require their suppliers  including eri  to accept contractual holdback provisions whereby the final amounts due under the sales contract are remitted over extended periods of time 
these retention payments typically range between and  and in some instances up to  of the total contract amount and are due and payable when the customer is satisfied that certain specified product performance criteria have been met upon commissioning of the desalination plant  which may be months to months from the date of product delivery as described further below 
the specified product performance criteria for our px device generally pertains to the ability of our product to meet its published performance specifications and warranty provisions  which our products have demonstrated on a consistent basis 
this factor  combined with historical performance metrics measured over the past years  provides our management with a reasonable basis to conclude that its px device will perform satisfactorily upon commissioning of the plant 
to ensure this successful product performance  we provide service  consisting principally of supervision of customer personnel  and training to the customers during the commissioning of the plant 
the installation of the px device is relatively simple  requires no customization and is performed by the customer under the supervision of our personnel 
we defer the value of the service and training component of the contract and recognizes such revenue as services are rendered 
based on these factors  our management has concluded that delivery and performance have been completed when the product has been delivered title transfers to the customer 
we perform an evaluation of credit worthiness on an individual contract basis to assess whether collectability is reasonably assured 
as part of this evaluation  our management considers many factors about the individual customer  including the underlying financial strength of the customer and or partnership consortium and management s prior history or industry specific knowledge about the customer and its supplier relationships 
under the stand alone contracts  the usual payment arrangements are summarized as follows an advance payment due upon execution of the contract  typically to of the total contract amount  a payment upon delivery of the product due on average between and days from product delivery  and in some cases up to days  typically in the range of to of the total contract amount  and a retention payment due subsequent to product delivery as described further below  typically in the range of to  and in some cases up to  of the total contract amount 
under the terms of the retention payment component  we are generally required to issue to the customer a product performance guarantee that takes the form of an irrevocable standby letter of credit  which is issued to the customer approximately to months after the product delivery date 
the letter of credit is either collateralized by restricted cash on deposit with a financial institution or funds available through a credit facility 
the letter of credit remains in place for the performance period as specified in the contract  which is generally to months and  in some cases  up to months from issuance 
the performance period generally runs concurrent with our standard product warranty period 
once the letter of credit has been put in place  we invoice the customer for this final retention payment under the sales contract 
during the time between the product delivery and the issuance of the letter of credit  the amount of the final retention payment is classified on the balance sheet as an unbilled receivable  of which a portion may be classified as long term 
table of contents to the extent that the billable period extends beyond one year 
once the letter of credit is issued  we invoice the customer and reclassify the retention amount from unbilled receivable to accounts receivable where it remains until payment 
we do not provide our customers with a right of product return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered that are covered by the terms and conditions of the product warranty 
product returns have not been significant 
reserves are established for possible product returns related to the advance replacement of products pending the determination of a warranty claim 
shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in sales 
the cost of shipping to customers is included in cost of revenue 
warranty costs we sell products with a limited warranty for a period ranging from one to six years 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product failure rates  historical activity and expectations of future costs 
periodically  we evaluate and adjust the warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including restricted stock units and employee stock options  over the requisite service period generally the vesting period of the awards for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on our stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires a number of complex assumptions  including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimates are revised 
see note  stock based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar  while the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies 
the asset and liability accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their local currencies at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of our subsidiary balance sheets are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income 
income taxes current tax assets and liabilities are based upon an estimate of taxes refundable or payable for each of the jurisdictions in which the company is subject to tax 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax positions 
we assess income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting dates 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
when applicable  associated interest and penalties are recognized as a 
table of contents component of income tax expense 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in basis of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes are recorded on temporary differences using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
significant estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
the ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result

net revenue our net revenue decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to customer project delays attributable to the global economic downturn and financial market crisis 
the average sales price of our px units increased resulting largely from more sales of our higher capacity px devices and served to offset some of the impacts of the customer order delays 
lastly  we experienced an 
table of contents increase in our service related revenue due to efforts targeted at increasing after market sales and services which also partially reduced the negative impacts stemming from the economic downturn 
the acquisition of pump engineering  llc on december  had a very small impact on our revenue base and amounted to million

the weakening global economy may cause our customers to delay or cancel plans for future orders of our products 
gross profit gross profit represents our net revenue less our cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials  personnel costs including stock based compensation  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  depreciation expense  excess and obsolete inventory expense  and manufactured components 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is raw materials  primarily ceramic materials  which we obtain from several suppliers 
for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was  as compared to for the year ended december  when adjusting for a one time reversal of a warranty provision in for the amount of  or 
the slight increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue  when adjusting for the one time warranty provision reversal in  was largely due to a higher average selling price during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  resulting largely from increased sales of our higher capacity px devices on a net basis 
the benefits of the higher average selling price in vs 
 however  was largely offset by an increase in period overhead costs associated with the opening of our new manufacturing facility in november and  to a lesser extent  an increase in ceramics materials costs in pump engineering  inc s gross margin during the day post acquisition stub period had a negligible impact on our overall gross margin percentage in as the merger of the companies occurred late in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents stock based compensation expense included in the cost of revenue was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  future gross profit is highly dependent on the product and customer mix of our net revenues as well as overall market demand and competition 
accordingly  we are not able to predict our future gross profit levels with certainty 
in addition  our recent production facility expansion is expected to have a negative impact to our margins if our production volume does not increase in the foreseeable future 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expense was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase of general and administrative expense was attributable primarily to the increase in general and administrative headcount to support our growth in operations and to support the requirements for operating as a public company 
the number of administrative employees averaged for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
of the million increase in general and administrative expense  compensation and employee related benefits comprised of million of the increase  followed by a million increase in occupancy and other administrative costs  a million increase in intangibles amortization due to the recent pump engineering  llc acquisition and an increase of million in bad debt expense

our average sales and marketing headcount during the year ended december  was compared to for the comparable period in as a percentage of our net revenue  sales and marketing expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in was attributable primarily to the decrease in our net revenue during that period 
the million net decrease in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  was made up of a number of components 
increases in base compensation and related benefit costs of million in were offset by decreases in commissions earned by employees and outside representatives of million during the period 
additionally  there was a decrease in outside service promotional costs of million during the year offset in part by an increase in facility and other marketing support costs of million 
stock based compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we expect that our future sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue increases 
research and development expense research and development expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the million increase  compensation and employee related benefits accounted for million and occupancy and other miscellaneous costs accounted for million  offset partially by a decrease in consulting and professional service fees of million

our average headcount in the research and development department increased to eleven for the year ended december  from eight for the comparable period in the prior year 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development expense was  for year ended december  and  for the year ended december  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase in the future as we expand and diversify our product offerings 
other income expense  net other net income expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the reduction in versus was primarily due to a decrease in interest earnings of  resulting from dramatically lower interest rates in compared to in addition  other asset losses and an unfavorable change in exchange rates related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies resulted in an unfavorable variance of approximately  offset in part by a reduction in net interest expense of  stemming from the reduction of equipment loans

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash historically has been proceeds from the issuance of common stock  customer payments for our products and services and borrowings under our credit facility 
from january  through december   we issued common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  excluding common stock issued in exchange for promissory notes 
the proceeds from the sales of common stock have been used to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  which are invested primarily in money market funds  and accounts receivable of million 
in july  we received approximately million of net proceeds from the ipo 
in february  we terminated a march credit agreement credit agreement with a financial institution and transferred million in cash to a restricted cash account as collateral for outstanding irrevocable standby letters of credit that were collateralized by the credit agreement as of the date of its termination and collateral for the outstanding equipment promissory note 
during the year ended december   million of the restricted cash was released 
the terminated credit agreement as amended replaced a million credit facility and million revolving note and served to increase allowable borrowings of up to million on a revolving basis at libor plus 
upon the termination of the credit agreement  a new loan and security agreement loan and security agreement with another financial institution became effective 
the new original agreement provided a total available credit line of million 
under the new agreement  we are allowed to draw advances up to million on a revolving line of credit or utilize up to million as collateral for irrevocable standby letters of credit  provided that the aggregate of the advances and the collateral do not exceed million 
advances under the revolving line of credit incur interest based on either a prime rate index or libor plus and is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the loan and security agreement was amended on december  to extend the expiration date of the original agreement from december  to may   to include our subsidiary  pump engineering  inc  as a co borrower and to modify the prime rate index and minimum interest rate 
as of december   we were non compliant with one financial covenant related to financial reporting 
in february  the lender granted a waiver for this non compliance 
during the years ended december  and  we provided certain customers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligations for the delivery and performance of products in accordance with sales arrangements 
these letters of credit were issued largely under our credit agreement and loan and security agreement 
the letters of credit generally terminate within to months  and in some cases up to months from issuance 
at december   the amounts outstanding on the letters of credit totaled approximately million of which million were issued under our loan and security agreement 
we have unbilled receivables pertaining to customer contractual holdback provisions  whereby we invoice the final installment due under a sales contract to months after the product has been shipped to the customer and revenue has been recognized 
the customer holdbacks represent amounts intended to provide a form of security for the customer rather than a form of long term financing  accordingly  these receivables have not been discounted to present value 
at december   we had million in current unbilled receivable 
at december   we had million of current unbilled receivables and million of non current unbilled receivables 
non current unbilled receivables as of december  consisted of unbilled receivables from customers due more than one year subsequent to period end

however  we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  if any  the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities  the timing and extent of our expansion into new geographic territories  the timing of introductions of new products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we may enter into potential material investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing

table of contents the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period operating capital notes purchase payments due during year ending december  leases leases payable obligations total thereafter present value of net minimum capital lease payments is  as reflected on the balance sheet 
includes million related to specialized equipment orders  million related to commitments for construction in progress  and million related to open purchase orders for materials and supplies 
this table excludes agreements with guarantees or indemnity provisions that we have entered into with customers and others in the ordinary course of business 
based on our historical experience and information known to us as of december   we believe that our exposure related to these guarantees and indemnities as of december  was not material 
supplier concentration certain of the raw materials and components that we use in the manufacturing of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers 
we do not enter into long term supply contracts with these suppliers 
for instance  we purchase the ceramic components for the px device pursuant to standard purchase orders that specify the quantity and price of various component parts to be delivered over a three month period 
we then update the pricing and quantity of our purchase orders based upon our most current forecast on a quarterly basis 
shortages could occur in these essential materials and components due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
if we are unable to procure certain of such materials or components  we would be required to reduce our manufacturing operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for the year ended december   three suppliers of which two were ceramics suppliers represented approximately of our total materials purchases 
as of december   approximately of our accounts payable and accrued inventory in transit were due to these key suppliers

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk currently  the majority of our revenue contracts have been denominated in united states dollars 
in some circumstances  we have priced certain international sales in euros 
the amount of revenue recognized denominated in euros amounted to zero  million and million in  and  respectively 
we experienced a net foreign currency gain loss of approximately   and  related to our revenue contracts for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as we expand our international sales  we expect that a portion of our revenue could continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents and operating results could be increasingly affected by changes in exchange rates 
our international sales and marketing operations incur expense that is denominated in foreign currencies 
this expense could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
our exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the united states dollar versus the euro 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our consolidated operating results or financial position 
additionally  our international sales and marketing operations maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to decrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency  we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign currencies 
we have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant to date  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  million  and  at december    and  respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
concentration of credit rate risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position represents the potential loss arising from disruptions caused by recent financial market conditions 
currently  our cash and cash equivalents are primarily deposited in a money market fund backed by us treasury securities  however  substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are in excess of federally insured limits at a very limited number of financial institutions 
this represents a high concentration of credit risk
