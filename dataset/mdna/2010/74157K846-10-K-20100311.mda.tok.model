item a 
risk factors below  we have described our present view of certain important risk factors 
this discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements  as discussed on page of this report 
these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this report or elsewhere 
the following information should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
deterioration in general economic conditions  and in the specific industries in which we operate  have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect advertising revenue 
national and local market economic conditions affect the overall levels of advertising revenue 
negative economic conditions  including a us recession and the nationwide and local downturn in the housing markets  have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our overall level of advertising revenue  and a failure of economic conditions to improve in our markets could adversely affect our future business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on large property management companies in the apartment leasing sector of the residential real estate industry for a majority of our revenue  and any economic or industry developments that adversely affect the number and value of leasing transactions generated could adversely impact our financial results 
the return on investment for our large property management company advertisers depends upon the comparison of how many leases we are generating for the managed communities in a particular local market  and the value of such leases  to the amount charged for our advertising 
many of the factors affecting the number and value of lease transactions are beyond our control 
in markets where occupancy levels are extraordinarily high or 
table of contents 
index to financial statements extraordinarily low  the management company s return on investment can be adversely affected  and the management company may choose to decrease the level of advertising  which could adversely affect our revenue 
the effects of occupancy rates can be mitigated or exacerbated by effective rent levels  which are essentially average rent amounts after giving effect to free months of rent and other incentives 
our new home directories and related websites depend on the new home sales sector of the residential real estate industry  which is cyclical 
approximately of our advertising revenue was generated from sales of advertising products to new home builders in the residential real estate industry 
this sector  which is cyclical  directly affects the success of our new homes division 
the return on investment for our new home builder advertisers depends on the success rate of actual sales that are closed in comparison to the advertising expenses paid 
if our advertisers experience lower return on investment because actual sales decline for reasons beyond our control  they tend to decrease their advertising budget  which adversely affects our revenue 
the united states economy is currently experiencing its worst downturn in the residential real estate industry in over years 
the duration of this downturn  as is true of most trends in the real estate industry  is unpredictable  and as a result  our prospects in this area are also unpredictable 
an economic recession  unfavorable taxation laws and regulations  higher credit standards  unavailability of mortgage loans  increased interest rates  increased unemployment  lower consumer confidence or lower wages can cause consumers to reduce their activity in the residential real estate industry  thus negatively impacting local new home sales markets 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive 
the markets for our products and services are disbursed throughout the united states 
generally  other online and print apartment and new home targeted resources for the consumer represent our main competitors 
to a lesser extent  we also compete with traditional newspapers and yellow pages 
competition for advertising is generally based on audience or traffic levels and demographics  price  service and advertising results 
competition from all relevant media and services affects our ability to attract and retain consumers and advertisers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates 
this competition has intensified as a result of the continued developments of digital media technologies 
distribution of advertising over the internet  as well as through mobile phones and other devices  continues to increase in popularity 
as a result  a shift from print advertising to online alternatives has contributed to significant declines in print advertising 
the majority of our current product offerings are built upon integrated media packages that feature online  mobile and print components 
however  we are continuing to aggressively develop and market our online products and services  and we could experience a decline in advertising revenue if we are unable to migrate print advertising to our website offerings in volumes or at rates sufficient to offset declines in print advertising 
if we are not successful in growing our digital products and services  our business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
our growth depends  to a significant degree  upon the development of our digital products and services 
accordingly  our ability to grow and succeed over the long term depends on various factors  including  among other things increasing our online traffic and attracting and retaining visitors to our websites  which may be adversely affected by search engines including google  the primary search engine directing traffic to our websites changing the algorithms responsible for directing search queries to web pages  attracting advertisers to our websites  which depends partly on our ability to generate online traffic and partly on the rate at which users engage in lease or sale transactions with advertisers using our websites  
table of contents 
index to financial statements maintaining or increasing advertising rates on our websites  which will depend  in part  on the market position of our brands  exploiting new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and developing new content  products and services  which may move in unanticipated directions due to the development of competitive alternatives  rapid technological change  regulatory changes and shifting market preferences  investing funds and resources in online opportunities  in which some of our existing competitors and possible additional entrants may have greater operational  financial and other resources than we do or may be better positioned to compete for certain opportunities  and attracting and retaining talent for critical positions 
even if we continue to develop our digital products and services  we may not be successful in generating or increasing revenue from these products or services due to increasing competition and economic conditions 
if we are not successful in maintaining or growing revenue from our digital products and services to offset current and anticipated declines in revenue from print products  our business  financial condition and prospects will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to meet rapid changes in technology  our services and technology and systems may become obsolete 
the internet and e commerce are constantly changing 
due to the costs and management time required to introduce new services and enhancements  we may not be able to respond in a timely manner to competitive innovations 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our online businesses 
further  to remain competitive  we must meet the challenges of the introduction by our competitors of new services using new technologies or the introduction of new industry standards and practices 
in addition  the vendors we use to support our technology may not provide the level of service we expect or may not continue to provide their product or services on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to meet any of these potential changes  or our vendors fail to provide the necessary support to our technology  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
our success and growth depend  to a significant degree  upon the protection of our intellectual property rights 
as a media company  we have a significant intellectual property portfolio  especially copyrights and trademarks  and have allocated considerable resources toward intellectual property maintenance  prosecution and enforcement 
for example  we hold and maintain or have pending applications for numerous copyrights and trademarks in connection with our various products and services  such as apartment guide 
in addition  we also continuously develop and create proprietary software to enhance our ability to effectively and efficiently update the listings in our online and print directories 
we may be unable to deter infringement or misappropriation of our data and other proprietary information  detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
any unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive for us to do business and consequently harm our business 
kohlberg kravis roberts co 
lp kkr has control of a majority of our outstanding common stock and has the power to elect all the members of our board of directors and to approve any action requiring stockholder approval 
as of march   approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock were held by investment partnerships of which kkr associates  lp and kkr gp llc are the general partners 
kkr associates and kkr gp have sole voting and investment power with respect to these shares 
consequently  kkr associates  lp and kkr gp llc and their respective general partners and members  two of whom are also on our board of directors  control us and have the power to elect all of our directors and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements approve any action requiring stockholder approval  including adopting amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
kkr associates  lp and kkr gp llc will also be able to prevent or cause a change of control at any time 
our stock price is volatile 
our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of a number of the factors discussed in this risk factors section  as well as divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  announcements that we  our competitors or our customers may make  and the relatively small portion of our outstanding shares that is in the hands of public investors  as opposed to our officers  directors and controlling interest investors 
we may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards nols  and  as a result  lose our future tax savings  which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial position 
nols may be utilized to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and reduce income taxes otherwise payable on such taxable income  subject to certain adjustments 
the internal revenue service irs or state taxing authorities could challenge the amount of the nols  which could result in increases in future income tax liabilities 
based on current federal and state corporate income tax rates  our nols could provide a benefit to us  if fully utilized  of significant future tax savings 
however  if we do not have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax benefits before they expire  we will lose the benefit of these nols permanently 
our inability to utilize available nols  if any  could require us to pay substantial additional federal and state taxes and interest  which may adversely affect our liquidity and financial position 
future legislation may result in our inability to realize the tax benefits of our nols 
it is possible that legislation or regulations will be adopted that would limit our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our nols 
however  we are not currently aware of any proposed changes in the tax laws or regulations that would materially and adversely impact our ability to use available nols  if any 
our use of nol carryforwards could be limited by ownership changes 
in addition to the general limitations on the carryback and carryforward of nols under section of the internal revenue code the code  section of the code imposes further limitations on the utilization of nols by a corporation following various types of ownership changes  generally resulting in more than a percentage point change in ownership of a corporation within a three year period 
therefore  the future utilization of our nols may be subject to limitation for regular federal income tax purposes 
we cannot be certain that the limitations of section will not limit or deny in full our future utilization of available nols  if any 
such limitation or denial could require us to pay substantial additional federal and state taxes and interest 
moreover  we cannot be certain that future ownership changes will not limit or deny in full our future utilization of all available nols 
if we cannot utilize available nols  if any  we may be required to pay substantial additional federal and state taxes and interest 
such tax and interest liabilities may adversely affect our liquidity and financial position 
if we are unable to meet continued listing requirements of the new york stock exchange  inc nyse  the nyse may delist our common stock  which could negatively affect the price of the common stock and your ability to sell the common stock 
in november  the nyse notified us that we were considered below criteria specifically because our average total market capitalization was less than million over a consecutive trading day period 
this 
table of contents 
index to financial statements required us to submit a plan that demonstrated our ability to achieve compliance with the continued listing standards within months of receipt of the notice 
in february  the nyse notified us that it had accepted our proposed plan for continued listing on the nyse  subject to quarterly reviews by the nyse s listing and compliance committee to ensure progress against the plan 
in june  the nyse lowered its minimum total market capitalization requirement to million and subsequently notified us that we were considered in compliance and that no quarterly reviews would be required 
in the future  we may not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of the nyse 
if we are unable to satisfy the nyse criteria for continued listing  our common stock would be subject to delisting 
trading  if any  in our common stock would thereafter be conducted on another exchange or quotation system 
as a consequence of any such delisting  a stockholder would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices for our common stock 
the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us 
we have relationships with several financial institutions as lenders under our credit facility and engage in transactions with other counterparties in the financial services industry 
defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  financial institutions or the financial services industry generally  could result in losses or defaults by these institutions 
as a result of lehman brothers  inc ceasing to be a participating lender in our credit facility  the total capacity under our revolving credit facility was reduced by million to million 
in the event that the volatility of the financial markets further adversely affects financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility  we may be unable to access our credit facility or complete financing transactions as intended  which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
our credit agreement limits our business flexibility by imposing operating and financial restrictions on our operations 
our credit agreement imposes specific operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions impose conditions or limitations on our ability to  among other things change the nature of our business  incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  sell assets  issue stock  engage in mergers  consolidations or transactions with our affiliates  make investments in or loans to specific subsidiaries  make guarantees or specific restricted payments  and declare or make dividend payments on our common stock 
our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our credit agreement could lead to a default under the terms of such agreement  which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 
if that occurred  we might not be able to refinance or otherwise satisfy our debt obligations  which could have a substantial adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may not be able to comply with these restrictions in the future  or  in order to comply with these restrictions  we may have to forego opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us 
our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain 
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management has identified certain accounting policies and estimates as being critical because they require management s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or reducing a liability 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures 
table of contents 
index to financial statements that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
because of the uncertainty of estimates about these matters  we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements

of the total of approximately million rentable square feet currently under lease  approximately million rentable square feet are fully subleased to third parties 
we consider the locations presently used by us for our operations to be adequate for our present needs

although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable  management believes that  in the aggregate  the outcome of all such lawsuits and claims will not have a material effect on our long term consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  any such outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs  if any  are recognized

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis summarizes our financial condition and operating performance and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary our company we are a targeted media company that provides consumers with tools and information they need to find a place to live 
our consumer directories are targeted primarily for the apartment and other rental property sectors of the residential real estate industry and are provided free to consumers through a combination of online  print and mobile platforms 
we derive advertising revenue by providing our advertiser clients property management companies  private owner landlords  new home builders and real estate professionals with products and services that generate measurable results in the form of cost effective  quality leads 
our principal digital assets include apartmentguide 
com  rentals 
com  rentalhouses 
com  newhomeguide 
com and americanhomeguides 
com 
according to comscore media metrix  unique visitors to our websites reached million in january  compared with million in january the total number of leads we produce for our advertisers has grown year over year  and leads derived from our online and mobile services now represent more than of the total leads we deliver to our advertiser clients 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we produce printed directories for markets and distribute them through display rack programs  many of which are on an exclusive basis  with large national and regional retail chains  including grocery  drug  convenience  video  fitness and mass merchandise retailers 
in  we distributed approximately million printed directories to approximately  advertiser client locations and  retail and other locations 
fiscal fourth quarter results fourth quarters ended december  change favorable unfavorable change favorable unfavorable dollars in thousands revenues  net provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income the decrease in revenue  net was primarily attributable to a decrease in new homes advertising revenue and distribution revenue 
the decrease in new homes advertising revenue was due to a decrease in revenue per community served driven by the continued weaknesses in the new home sales sector and a decrease in new home communities served 
the decrease in distribution revenue was due to a decrease in the average revenue per pocket due to softness in demand and a decrease in the number of pockets sold in our display racks due largely to the reduction in retail locations serviced 
income from continuing operations decreased primarily due to lower revenue of million and the release in of million in deferred tax asset valuation allowance  partially offset by decreases in in distribution and circulation of million  cost of goods sold of million  and general and administrative of million 
net income decreased due to the factors above  partially offset by a million increase in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  which was the result of a benefit recorded from our estimated liability for certain tax related contingencies of approximately million  primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations 
summary consolidated results in  revenue was million  down as compared to million in in  costs and expenses were million  down compared to million in in  income from continuing operations was million  compared to million in net income was million in compared to million in  which included gain on sale of businesses  net of tax  of million 
business trends and outlook the continuing and deepening deterioration in the economy generally and in the conditions in the residential real estate industry in particular have resulted in relatively low occupancy and effective rent levels on a national basis 
though local market conditions vary  our advertisers generally have responded to these conditions with shifts in marketing strategies and budget cuts  which have depressed and may continue to depress our advertising 
table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue 
as we look ahead  we believe advertisers will continue to be cautious with their budgets  focusing more on total advertising spend than on roi  and advertising revenue is likely to continue to be challenged in also contributing to shifts in marketing strategies of our advertisers is the continuing increase in popularity of online advertising  including through mobile phones and other devices 
the broad shift from print advertising to online alternatives has contributed to significant declines in print advertising across traditional media products and services 
most of our current offerings are built upon integrated media packages that include online  print and mobile components 
however  we have seen the effects of this trend in revenue declines attributable to our premium print products  as well as increasing advertiser focus on our online and mobile offerings 
the targeted nature of our roi based print products is why they continue to deliver substantial value to our advertisers  even though the greater portion of the value we now deliver in the form of leads on a national basis has shifted to our digital products and services 
the mix of advertising results  and therefore value  as between our digital and print products and services is highly market specific  with consumers in some markets favoring print products  while those in other markets favor our internet or mobile services 
overall  we expect our advertisers to increasingly favor digital media choices in their advertising budgets  and we are continuing to aggressively develop and market our online and mobile offerings 
however  at least in the shorter term  we anticipate continuing decreases in revenue per community served as we increase apartment communities served 
we believe that our growth will depend  to a significant degree  upon the value of our online products and services and our ability to monetize this value 
during  we intend to continue to grow our client count and market share in our largest business  apartment guide  and pursue enhancements to our product portfolio and market and market segment expansion 
we also intend to grow our rentals 
com business by focusing on improving site engineering and performance  while increasing traffic  primarily through search engine optimization 
our visibility around revenue for apartments is extremely limited  given general economic and market conditions  though we currently expect to see a to year over year decline in first quarter apartments revenue  similar to the percentage decline experienced in fourth quarter we anticipate continued pressure on our new homes business during  and we remain focused on managing costs for this business in accordance with anticipated levels of revenue and managing our client relationships to best position us for opportunities as macroeconomic conditions improve 
we currently expect a to year over year decline in new homes revenue in first quarter we anticipate that distributech will continue to be impacted by lower revenue from customers that publish free publications and are scaling back or ceasing operations or providing an internet only product and by further reductions in retail locations serviced 
since  we have undertaken strategic initiatives to substantially reduce the cost structure of our distribution function 
as a result  distribution costs decreased from million in to million in we intend to continue aggressively reducing our distribution cost structure and expect to incur restructuring charges related to our rdas of between million and million in we currently expect a to year over year decline in distributech revenue in first quarter our overall distribution strategy is to reduce our overall print distribution costs as we devote greater resources to opportunities for growth that digital media present and eliminate less effective locations  while focusing our efforts on retaining and servicing locations that produce the best results for primedia advertisers in terms of leads 
we intend to move to a smaller  more efficient distribution model that primarily relies on third party distribution services  in combination with more limited internal resources  to deliver our directories

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the significant accounting policies  outlined in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  are integral to an understanding of management s discussion and analysis 
the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of the results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made 
these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
we base some of our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  gaap allows or requires many assets and liabilities to be accounted for at fair value  which is defined to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
gaap also requires that certain assets be assessed for impairment based on fair value 
in cases where active markets do not exist  as discussed below  modeling or other techniques may be required to estimate fair value 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements  and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period to period in the future 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this management s discussion and analysis 
goodwill impairment testing 
goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test  at least annually 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from an entity s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  we test  at a reporting unit level  goodwill for impairment and have established october as the annual impairment testing date 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management 
our assets and liabilities are assigned to reporting units to the extent that they are employed in or are considered a liability related to the operations of the reporting units and are considered in determining the fair value of the reporting units 
we presently have only one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test is conducted by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit  which begins with management s expectations of cash flows in the next five years plus an expected residual value 
a discount factor  approximating our weighted average cost of capital for and  is then applied to the forecasted cash flows to determine the present value 
the resulting fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as long as the present value is greater  there is no impairment to goodwill 
while we believe all assumptions utilized in our assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in actual earnings  the growth rate of future earnings  the effective tax rate for and and our weighted average cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
in management s estimation  most sensitive of these assumptions is cash flows from future earnings 
over the past six years  our actual revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and other ebitda have generally been within a range of higher to lower than our forecasted amounts 
in our annual impairment testing for  we determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value 
we have also performed a sensitivity analysis of our calculated fair value by assuming our cash flows from future earnings to be lower than our forecast 
the results indicated that such declines would not result in an indicated goodwill impairment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
those events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized eg  when a decision is made to dispose of an asset and certain other criteria are met  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset and a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of an asset 
when such a review is conducted  we use an estimate of undiscounted cash flows  which are derived from our historical experience and long term business plans  over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability 
if the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  factors were identified indicating that the carrying value of certain of our advertiser lists might not be recoverable 
we determined that the expected undiscounted cash flows associated with one advertiser list were less than the carrying value and  as a result  recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in amortization of intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
we also determined that the decline in the value of these assets was occurring faster than the expense being recognized using the straight line method of amortization 
to better match the deterioration in the value of the assets  we also concluded that an accelerated method of amortization over a shorter estimated life would be appropriate and made this change in estimate effective january  income taxes and tax related liabilities 
our income tax expense is affected by judgments we must make about the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and our reserves for uncertain tax positions 
our net income is also impacted by our judgments about our tax related contingent liabilities 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences ie  amounts that are recognized as income or deducted as expenses at different times for gaap and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets also arise from benefits recorded from nols ie  amounts representing losses for tax purposes that may be utilized in future years to offset taxable income 
a net deferred tax asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance must be sufficient to reduce the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are recorded as increases or decreases in income tax expense 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character eg  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law 
there are four possible sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback year s if carryback is permitted under the tax law  and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to  for example accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards  or change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss 
evidence available about each of those possible sources of taxable income will vary for different tax jurisdictions and  possibly  from year to year 
to the extent evidence about one or more sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary  other sources need not be considered 
consideration of each source is required  however  to determine the amount of the valuation allowance that is recognized for deferred tax assets 
after consideration of the available evidence  a valuation allowance  if warranted  is established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in evaluating the ability to realize deferred tax assets  including nols  and any need for a valuation allowance  it is necessary to first consider the recognition threshold for uncertain tax positions and reduce the deferred tax assets by any required reserve for uncertain tax positions 
as of december   we had aggregate federal nols of approximately million  which are available to reduce future taxable income  and the substantial majority expire between and in addition  we have state and local nols in various jurisdictions in which we and or our subsidiaries file income tax returns 
these state and local nols expire over various periods based on applicable state and local regulations 
the federal  state and local nols are the single largest component of our net deferred tax asset 
additionally  since amortization of tax deductible goodwill and trademarks ceased for gaap purposes on january   we expect that deferred tax liabilities will arise each quarter because the taxable temporary differences related to the amortization of these assets are not expected to reverse prior to the expiration period of our deductible temporary differences unless the related assets are sold or an impairment of the assets is recorded 
consequently  we may record a valuation allowance in excess of our net deferred tax assets to the extent the difference between the book and tax basis of indefinite lived intangible assets is not expected to reverse during the nol period 
based on the weight of objectively verifiable available positive and negative evidence  at december   we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but million of our net deferred tax asset because we believe only this portion is more likely than not to be realized 
we will need to generate approximately million in pre tax income for financial reporting purposes to realize this asset 
elements of positive evidence about the realizability of our asset included remaining lives of the nols  historical income when results are normalized to remove the impact of discontinued operations and to reflect the completion of the company s relocation from new york to norcross  and forecasted income  utilizing the same forecast as for goodwill impairment testing in future periods 
elements of negative evidence about the realizability of our asset included historical losses and uncertainty as to the timing and exact amount of future earnings as a result of current economic conditions  the us residential real estate industry  as well as the uncertainty of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken  and will take  to mitigate the adverse impact on our businesses 
our assessment in is consistent with our view in as of december   we maintained a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets 
we may release additional valuation allowance in future periods when we can conclude that a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent we report taxable income in future periods  we intend to use nols  to the extent allowable  to offset that taxable income and reduce cash outflows for income taxes 
our ability to use our federal and state nols and federal and state tax credit carryforwards may be subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions in the future resulting from changes in ownership as defined under the internal revenue code 
uncertain tax positions 
gaap for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
uncertainty can arise because a tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 

table of contents 
index to financial statements under gaap  in order to be recognized  tax benefits from a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we must adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of an examination 
currently  we are under audit by the internal revenue service irs for our and federal consolidated income tax filings and other material state taxing jurisdictions for income for filings for the tax years through we reported nols from tax years back to on federal and state tax returns currently under  or open to  examination 
we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors  including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and involves a series of complex judgments about future events 
at december   we had total unrecognized tax benefits of million and a recorded liability for uncertain tax positions of million 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is examined and finally resolved  and due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of the completion of income tax examinations  it is difficult to assess when changes in our estimated liability will occur 
however  the statutes of limitations in certain state and local jurisdictions are expected to lapse within the next twelve months and may result in a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of approximately million 
tax related contingent liabilities 
in connection with the sale of assets and the divestiture of businesses  we may agree to indemnify the buyer and related parties for certain losses or liabilities incurred by the buyer with respect to liabilities related to the pre closing operations of the assets sold  including tax liabilities not assumed by the buyer in the transaction 
as with any liability  we have accrued for those tax related contingent obligations that are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
over time  circumstances could change that might increase the likelihood of payment related to a specific indemnity for which no reserve has been established 
additionally  our estimate about the amount due under to a specific indemnity could change 
either of these situations will result in a change in our net income 
during the year ended december   we reduced certain tax related contingent liability obligations  while the statutes of limitations for others ultimately lapsed  and resulted in the reduction of a significant portion of the recorded liability  which resulted in a million benefit to earnings in discontinued operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
awards of performance based restricted stock also require estimates about whether and to what extent applicable performance thresholds are likely to be achieved  which results in vesting of the award according to a predetermined formula 
the most commonly granted form of stock based compensation has been stock options 
the fair value of stock options is determined using an option pricing model that takes into account certain assumptions  including the exercise price  which is typically the stock price at the grant date  the expected life of the grant  the volatility of the underlying stock  the expected dividends on the stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the grant 
the fair value of a stock option estimated at the grant date is not subsequently adjusted for changes in the price of the underlying stock or its volatility  the life of the grant  dividends on the stock or the risk free interest rate 
generally  changes in the assumptions will have the following impact on the fair value of stock option awards assumption impact on fair value exercise price increased price lower fair value decreased price higher fair value expected life of grant increased life higher fair value decreased life lower fair value volatility of underlying stock increased volatility higher fair value decreased volatility lower fair value expected dividends higher dividends lower fair value lower dividends higher fair value risk free interest rate higher rate lower fair value lower rate higher fair value allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of losses in our accounts receivable resulting from our customers failure to make required payments 
we continually monitor collections from customers and the age of outstanding balances 
each of our businesses provides for estimated credit losses based on historical analysis of the propensity of their customer base to make required payments 
the following is operational information related to our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts as of and for the years ended december  bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenue  net write offs of uncollectable accounts as a percentage of total revenues  net allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable we aggressively pursue collection efforts on overdue accounts and  upon collection of any amounts previously written off  reverse the write off

index to financial statements need to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we do not believe those increases or decreases would have a material impact on our long term consolidated financial position or liquidity  although they could be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which they are recognized 
provision for restructuring costs 
reserves for restructuring costs are estimated costs resulting from our plans and actions to integrate the company and consolidate certain back office functions 
examples include employee related termination costs  the cost of terminating or foregoing our rights under our rdas and the cost of the termination of real estate leases  net of anticipated sublease income  if applicable  and the related write off of leasehold improvements 
many of these costs are estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
the most sensitive inputs into this model are the discount rate  which is based on current rates that would be offered to us for debt with a remaining maturity equivalent to the cash flows  and estimates of sublease income 
if the future payments of these costs or amounts of sublease income were to differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our reserves

generally  advertising spend by property management company advertisers is driven by local market factors outside our control  including occupancy rates and effective rent levels  which are essentially average rent amounts after giving effect to free months of rent and other incentives 
our historical experience has been that as occupancy rates increase beyond  apartment communities tend to reduce their advertising spend because they require fewer prospective tenants 
as occupancy rates fall below  apartment communities tend to cut back on all discretionary spending  including advertising 
for these reasons  occupancy rates in excess of or below ordinarily result in a decrease in revenue per community served

index to financial statements during  we had an increase in costs for professional fees  including legal fees 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in adjustments to accrued operating lease liabilities primarily related to workplace learning  as well as  a decrease in deal and other costs related to the divesture of pem s segment in from december  to december   there was a total increase in total benefit for income taxes of million 
as a result of the gains on the sale of businesses during  we recorded a provision of million compared to a benefit of million in  creating a million change year over year 
we also recorded a decrease to our uncertain tax positions liability creating a decrease in the provision for income taxes year over year by million 
these favorable changes were partially offset by a change in pre tax income loss on discontinued operation as discussed above that decreased the provision for tax benefit on pre tax income loss by million year over year due to a decrease in pre tax loss and a decrease in deferred tax assets being utilized in additional details about our divestitures are included in note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
as is more fully discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  in  we sold substantially all of the assets of workplace learning for the assumption of ongoing liabilities  while retaining a secondary liability as the assignor of the building and satellite time leases 
during the fourth quarter of  we reassumed the building lease on behalf of workplace learning and entered into a sublease with the current tenant for a period of months  with an early termination option  which would reduce the term of the sublease to months 
the sublease provides for a monthly rent payment and a set reimbursement percentage for operating expenses 
we are currently undertaking efforts to sublease additional vacant space in the building to further offset our obligations under the lease 
this transaction did not have a material impact on our recorded liability 
historically  each month  our liability has been reduced either by fulfilling our liability as lessee under the building lease or due to a sub lessee s or successor in interest s performance under the terms of the sublease  which results in income for us 
during the year ended december  and  as a result of the assignee s or successor in interest s performance  we recorded million and million in income  respectively  which is included in discontinued operations

additionally  during the years ended december  and  we recorded charges of million and million in discontinued operations  respectively  for various other litigation related losses 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for more information 
during the year ended december   we recognized a tax benefit of million in discontinued operations  primarily as a result of our ability to carry back a projected nol against taxes paid on a portion of the gain on divestitures of certain subsidiaries 
the nol arose primarily from the reversal of differences between the carrying value and tax basis in a group of primedia healthcare intangible assets triggered by the sale of those assets during we also recognized a tax benefit of million in discontinued operations during the year ended december   primarily as a result of changes in our estimate of our ability to utilize certain nols to offset taxable income

all such principal prepaid or acquired will be retired and extinguished and deemed paid effective upon such prepayment or acquisition 
the amendment also memorializes the reduction of the revolving facility commitment of lehman commercial paper inc  a subsidiary of lehman brothers inc lehman to million  and  as a consequence thereof  the total capacity under the revolving facility has now been confirmed to have been reduced by million to million 
we believed and previously disclosed that the total capacity under the revolving facility had been effectively reduced by million as a result of bankruptcy proceedings related to lehman brothers holdings inc  the parent company of lehman 
the commitment under the revolving facility for each other lender remains unchanged from each such lender s commitment immediately prior to such reduction 
additionally  effective june   lehman ceased to be a co documentation agent under the bank credit facility

in connection with the amendment  we incurred approximately million in modification fees  which were paid to the creditors and will be expensed over the remaining term of the loan 
there are no scheduled commitment reductions under the revolving facility 
the loan under the term loan b facility is subject to scheduled repayment in quarterly installments of approximately million payable on march  june  september and december of each year  followed by a final repayment of million on the term loan b maturity date 
additionally  through august   we were required to manage our interest rate risk arising from the term loan b facility through the utilization of derivative financial instruments in a notional amount equal to at least of the term loan b facility principal outstanding

the interest rate on these obligations resets quarterly and had a weighted average rate of at december  see the discussion above under bank credit facilities 
liabilities for interest rate swaps designated in cash flow hedging relationships against changes in the benchmark interest rate of our long term debt have also been excluded from this table because the quarterly fixed rate payments due to the counterparty are settled net of the variable rate payments due to us by the counterparty 
future rental commitments for operating leases have not been reduced by minimum noncancelable sublease income aggregating million as of december  operating lease obligations include certain restructuring liabilities

the contractual obligations table above does not reflect any of our million in unrecognized tax benefits at december   which resulted in a recorded liability of million that has been accrued in accordance with gaap related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  because we are unable to determine when  or if  payment of these amounts will be made

the cost of paper decreased when comparing the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of we presently anticipate moderate increases in paper prices in seasonality our operations are minimally seasonal in nature

we experience modest seasonality in rentals 
com as that business declines in the winter months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates  primarily through our term loan b facility  which is variable rate debt that had an outstanding balance of million as of december  as part of our management of interest rate risk  we have designated derivative financial instruments in hedging relationships against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate on our term loan b facility 
the table below shows the change in interest expense we estimate would occur over the next months from and basis point increases and decreases in interest rates based upon our current term loan b facility balance and derivative financial instrument positions as of december  such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of debt and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for one year 
changes in interest expense interest rate change in basis december  points dollars in thousands credit risk our hedging transactions using derivative financial instruments also involve certain additional risks  such as counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are major financial institutions and securities dealers  which we believe are well capitalized with investment grade credit ratings and with which we may have other financial relationships 
while we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty  we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event the counterparty fails to perform 
our exposure to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty is the difference between the value of the contract and the current market price at the time of the default 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related expenses incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies
