we also have research and development alliances with partners and ongoing technology sharing relationships with our principal contract manufacturers 
we anticipate that we will continue to employ research and development alliances to maximize the impact of our internal research and development investment 

table of contents customers  sales  marketing and distribution we have a diversified and historically stable customer base 
in the year ended october   no customer accounted for or more of our net revenue  and our top customers  which included five distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we sell our products through a network of distributors and our direct sales force globally 
our customers require timely delivery often to multiple locations around the world 
we have strategically developed distributor relationships to serve tens of thousands of customers 
our direct sales force is focused on supporting our large oem customers 
additionally  our extensive network of faes enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities 
within north america  we also complement our direct sales force with a network of manufacturing sales representative companies to cover our emerging oem customers in order to ensure these customers receive the proper level of attention and support 
our main global distributors are avnet  inc  and arrow electronics  inc complemented by a number of specialty regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges 
as of october   our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately employees  many of whom have responsibility for emerging accounts  for large  global accounts  or for our distributors 
our sales force has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer s organization 
as part of our global reach  we have sales offices located in nine countries  with a significant presence in asia  which is a key center of the worldwide electronics supply chain 
many of our customers design products in north america or europe that are then manufactured in asia 
we maintain dedicated regional customer support call centers  where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements 
we are well positioned to support our customers throughout the design  technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies 
operations a majority of our manufacturing operations are outsourced and we utilize external foundries to fabricate our semiconductors  including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd  or tsmc and win semiconductors corp 
for certain of our product families  substantially all of our revenue is derived from semiconductors fabricated by external foundries  including our high speed serdes ics  leds  and led based displays 
we also use third party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations  including amertron incorporated  sae magnetics hk ltd  and the hana microelectronics public company ltd

for selected customers  we maintain finished goods inventory near or at customer manufacturing sites to support their just in time production 
materials and suppliers our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors  electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials 
we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis 
these supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis 
while we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material  some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for re design or qualification 
our long term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans  and to monitor our suppliers financial health 
some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times  limit supplies  increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products 
if these are unique components  we may not be able to find a substitute quickly  or 
table of contents at all 
to address the potential disruption in our supply chain  we use a number of techniques  including qualifying multiple sources of supply where practicable  redesign of products for alternative components and purchase of incremental inventory for supply buffer 
competition the global semiconductor market is highly competitive 
while no company competes with us in all of our target markets  our competitors range from large  international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we compete with integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large  integrated oems 
the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry  as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other 
we expect this consolidation trend to continue 
we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market 
additionally  our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors  including quality  technical performance  price  product features  product system compatibility  system level design capability  engineering expertise  responsiveness to customers  new product innovation  product availability  delivery timing and reliability  and customer sales and technical support 
in the wireless communications target market  we provide rf amplifiers  filters  optical finger navigation sensors  modules and leds for mobile phones 
our primary competitors for this target market are anadigics  inc  hittite microwave corporation  rf micro devices  inc  skyworks solutions  inc and triquint semiconductor  inc

in the consumer and computing peripherals target market  we provide optical mouse image sensors for optical mice and motion control encoders and subsystems for printers and optical disk drives 
our primary competitors for this target market are pixart imaging inc and sharp corporation 
in these applications  we compete based on our long history of innovation and market leadership  along with our design expertise 
intellectual property our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including patents  mask works  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  as well as customary contractual protections with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through security measures to protect our trade secrets 
we believe our current product expertise  key engineering talent and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 
we are the successor to the semiconductor products group of agilent technologies  inc  which we acquired on december  in a transaction that we refer to as the spg acquisition 
we acquired ownership and license rights to a portfolio of patents and patent applications  as well as certain registered trademarks and service marks for discrete product offerings  from agilent in the spg acquisition 
we have continued to have issued to us  and to file 
table of contents for  additional united states and foreign patents since the spg acquisition 
as of october   we had approximately  us and  foreign patents and approximately us and  foreign pending patent applications 
our research and development efforts are presently resulting in approximately new patent applications per year relating to a wide range of rf and optoelectronic components and associated applications 
the expiration dates of our patents range from to  with a small number of patents expiring in the near future  none of which are expected to be material to our intellectual property portfolio 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or to the extent that the examination process will require us to narrow our claims 
since the spg acquisition  we have focused our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products as contrasted with more basic research 
much of our intellectual property is the subject of cross licenses to other companies that have been granted by agilent  or if originally derived from hewlett packard company  by hewlett packard company 
in addition  we license third party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities  products and manufacturing processes 
historically  licenses of the third party technologies used by us have been available to us on acceptable terms 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which has in the past required and may in the future require that we defend those claims  and might also require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings 
claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us 
with respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers or distributors  we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product  pay damages  expend resources to develop non infringing technology  seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights 
employees as of october   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
approximately  were dedicated to research and development   to manufacturing  to sales and marketing and to general and administrative functions 
by geography  approximately of our employees are located in asia  in north america and in europe 
the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement 
however  approximately of our  employees in singapore  none of whom are in management or supervisory positions  are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with united workers of electronic and electrical industries that expires on june  in addition  all of our employees in italy and some employees in japan are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
in italy we are also subject to national collective agreements between unions and employer associations 
such italian national collective agreements are compulsory for both the employees and the employer 
in addition  in germany we are subject to collective agreements with the works councils at our sites  which apply to german employees other than managing directors and managers with similar authority 
we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and we have never experienced an interruption of business as a result of labor disputes 
environmental and other regulation our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international  federal  state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment 
these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air  water  and soil  remediation requirements  product chemical content limitations  manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions  pollution control requirements  waste minimization considerations  and treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we are also subject to regulation by the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 

table of contents we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws  however  the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 
we are also regulated under a number of international  federal  state and local laws regarding recycling  product packaging and product content requirements  including legislation enacted in the european union and china  among a growing number of jurisdictions  which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products  which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging 
these laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 
backlog our sales are generally made pursuant to short term purchase orders 
these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be  and often are  rescheduled  canceled or modified on relatively short notice  and in most cases without substantial penalty 
therefore  we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not a reliable indicator of future sales 
seasonality we are affected by seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower revenues in the first fiscal half of the year 
our revenue in the second half of the fiscal year is typically higher than our revenue in the first half of the fiscal year due to seasonality in two of our target markets  consumer and computing peripherals and wireless communications 
these target markets typically experience seasonality due to the back to school and calendar year end holiday selling seasons

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business  operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and the trading price of our ordinary shares 
the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
risks related to our business we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  these and other factors  together with changes in general economic conditions  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular 
for example  the global semiconductor market experienced substantial declines in and  in each case beyond the declines experienced in the typical cycles experienced by the semiconductor industry  due in large part to deteriorating global economic conditions during those periods 
periods of industry downturns  including the recent economic downturn  have been characterized by diminished demand for end user products  high inventory levels  underutilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices  resulting in  an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even as overall economic conditions improve 
our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others changes in end user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers  the timing of receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers  fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  the timing and extent of product development costs  new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  incurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures  seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets  currency fluctuations  utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  significant warranty claims  including those not covered by our suppliers or our insurers  availability and cost of raw materials from our suppliers  changes in our product mix or customer mix  
table of contents intellectual property disputes  loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  and changes in our tax incentive arrangements or structure  which may adversely affect our net tax expense in any quarter in which such an event occurs 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales  research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs 
any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance 
if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares may occur 
the recent economic downturn and financial crisis has negatively affected our business and continuing poor economic conditions may negatively affect our future business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the recent global economic downturn and financial crisis led to slower economic activity  unemployment  concerns about inflation and energy costs  decreased business and consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and lower levels of liquidity in many financial markets 
the global recession also led to reduced customer spending in the semiconductor market and in our target markets during  made it difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and caused us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products 
it has also caused consumers to reduce spending on many products our customers make  such as personal computers  mobile phone and flat screen televisions 
while many areas of the global economy are improving  including portions of the semiconductor industry  a slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening global economic conditions  including as a result of conditions in europe  may cause additional reductions in customer spending and could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  customer insolvencies  and also counterparty failures that may negatively impact our treasury operations 
our business  financial condition and result of operations were negatively affected in prior periods as a result of the recent downturn  and  if the global economic situation worsens  could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
if we do not adapt to technological changes in the semiconductor industry  we could lose customers or market share 
the semiconductor industry is subject to constant and rapid changes in technology  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles  rapid product obsolescence and evolving technical standards 
technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our products and require unbudgeted upgrades that could be expensive and time consuming to implement 
our products could become obsolete sooner than we expect because of faster than anticipated  or unanticipated  changes in one or more of the technologies related to our products 
furthermore  we continually evaluate expenditures for research and development and must choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth and other factors 
we may be unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced products that satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner or at all  the technologies where we have focused our research and development expenditures may not become commercially successful  and we may be unable to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes 
we also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors 
if we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important new technologies  we may be unable to retain customers  attract new customers or sell new products to our existing customers 

table of contents dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation 
we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third party foundry and assembly and test capabilities 
as a result  we are highly reliant on third party foundry wafer fabrication and assembly and test capacity  including sole sourcing for many components or products 
for certain of our product families  substantially all of our revenue from those products is derived from semiconductors fabricated by external foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
and win semiconductors corp 
we also use third party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations  including amertron incorporated  sae magnetics hk ltd  and the hana microelectronics public company ltd 
group of companies 
the ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control 
if one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer 
if one of our suppliers  particularly a single source supplier  ceases to  or is unable to  manufacture such a component or supply is otherwise constrained  we may be forced to re engineer a product or may fail to meet customer demand 
in addition to discontinuing parts  suppliers may also extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
for example  in the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities  including as a response by contract manufacturers to cycles in the semiconductor industry  manufacturing could be disrupted  we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could decline 
in addition  if these third parties on whom we are highly reliant fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable prices  we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could decline 
in such events  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
to the extent we rely on third party manufacturing relationships  we face the following risks inability of our manufacturers to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and their unwillingness to devote adequate capacity to produce our products  product and manufacturing costs that are higher than anticipated  reduced control over product reliability and delivery schedules  more complicated supply chains  and time  expense and uncertainty in identifying and qualifying additional or replacement manufacturers 
much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries  and as a result may additionally be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 
see our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 
a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we operate using a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model  we do rely on the manufacturing facilities we own  in particular our fabrication facilities in fort collins  colorado and singapore 
we maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative materials and processes  to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing 
a prolonged disruption or material malfunction of  interruption in or the loss of operations at one or more of our production facilities  especially our fort collins and singapore facilities  or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities  would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment  if necessary  were found 
the lease on our primary internal fabrication facility in singapore expires in if we are unable to renew this lease on satisfactory terms  we would be required to locate suitable replacement premises  with the goal of ensuring a smooth transition between facilities on or prior to the expiration of our current lease 
however  the replacement of this  or any other  manufacturing facility could take an extended amount of time and significant expenditures on our part before manufacturing operations could restart 

table of contents while we would seek to minimize any disruption to our operations and supply chain associated with any such changes in manufacturing facilities  we may experience delays and significant costs resulting from these steps  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unless we and our suppliers continuously improve manufacturing efficiency and quality  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our suppliers  as well as our competitors  continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields and increase costs 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future financial performance  and we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
for products that we outsource manufacturing  our product yields and performance will be subject to the manufacturing efficiencies of our third party suppliers 
from time to time  we and our suppliers have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities  achieving and maintaining a high level of process quality and effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes  all of which have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we and our suppliers may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities as we may be required to do with our manufacturing facility in singapore  in or prior to  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by any increase in costs related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
winning business is subject to lengthy  competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expense 
even if we begin a product design  a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to generate no revenues from a product and adversely affect our results of operations 
we are focused on winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  to develop semiconductors for use in our customers products 
these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products will likely have very short life cycles 
failure to obtain a design win sometimes prevents us from offering an entire generation of a product 
this can result in lost revenues and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes 
after winning a product design  we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required 
in addition  a delay or cancellation of a customer s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results  as we may have incurred significant expense in the design process and generated no revenue 
finally  our customers failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and loss of our intellectual property rights 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
for example  we are currently involved in a dispute with triquint semiconductor  inc  or triquint  in which  among 
table of contents other things  triquint is seeking a judgment that one of our patents relating to rf filter technology used in our wireless products is invalid and  if valid  that triquint s products do not infringe that patent  and is claiming that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents 
see part ii  item legal proceedings above for additional information regarding this dispute 
claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate these rights  regardless of their merit or resolution  are frequently costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  many of our customer agreements and in some cases our asset sale agreements require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which have required and may in the future require that we defend those claims  and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings 
claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us 
we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome  we could be required to cease the manufacture  use or sale of the infringing products  processes or technology  pay substantial damages for past  present and future use of the infringing technology  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  license technology from the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  enter into cross licenses with our competitors  which could weaken our overall intellectual property portfolio  indemnify customers or distributors  pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non infringing technology  or relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims  if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  as well as customary contractual protections with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through security measures to protect our trade secrets 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and there can be no assurance that  even with significant expenditures  we will be able to protect our intellectual property rights 
we are unable to predict that any of the patents and pending patent applications  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  or  in the case of third party intellectual property rights  licensed or sub licensed to us  be licensed to others our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us  rights previously granted by third parties to intellectual property rights licensed or assigned to us  including portfolio cross licenses  will not hamper our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes  
table of contents any of our pending or future patent  trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  or our intellectual property rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions  relative to those protections available in the united states  or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions 
moreover  from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights  including  in some cases  against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships  such as customers and suppliers  and third parties may pursue litigation against us 
for example  we have filed suit against st microelectronics nv  or st microelectronics  in which  we are seeking a judgment that they have infringed five of our patents relating to optical navigation devices and they have counter filed against us alleging that certain of our optical navigation devices infringe two of their patents  among other things 
see part i  item legal proceedings below for additional information regarding this dispute 
an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights and limit the value of our technology  including the loss of opportunities to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 
in addition  such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time we may need to obtain additional intellectual property licenses or renew existing license agreements 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 
competition in our industry could prevent us from growing our revenue and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the global semiconductor market is highly competitive 
we compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of  among other things  quality  technical performance  price  product features  product system compatibility  system level design capability  engineering expertise  responsiveness to customers  new product innovation  product availability  delivery timing and reliability  and customer sales and technical support 
current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors 
some of our competitors are well established  have a more extensive product portfolio  have substantially greater market share and manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer independent operating histories  greater presence in key markets  more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition 
we compete with integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large  integrated oems 
our competitors range from large  international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  or ics  we also face competition from manufacturers of ics  as well as customers that develop their own ic products 
the competitive landscape is changing as a result of an increasing trend of consolidation within the industry  as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other 
we expect this consolidation trend to continue 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
during past periods of downturns in our industry  competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
the actions of our competitors  particularly in the area of pricing  can have a substantial adverse impact on our revenues  and potentially on revenues in specific industry end markets 
in periods 
table of contents where the semiconductor industry experiences significant declines  manufacturers in financial difficulties or in bankruptcy may implement pricing structures designed to ensure short term market share and near term survival  rather than securing long term viability 
in addition  many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and any associated pricing actions of other market participants in the future 
we may be unable to make the substantial and productive research and development investments which are required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
in order to remain competitive  we anticipate that we will need to maintain or increase our levels of research and development expenditures  and we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop 
we do not know whether we will have sufficient resources to maintain or increase the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the technologies where we have focused our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue  our operating results could decline 
our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our senior management team  in particular  the services of mr 
hock e 
tan  our president and chief executive officer 
none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management 
the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 
if we are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  especially our design and technical personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
our future success depends on our ability to retain  attract and motivate qualified personnel  including our management  sales and marketing  legal and finance  and especially our design and technical personnel 
we do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy 
we have historically encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with expertise in analog and optoelectronic semiconductor design 
competition for such personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset 
the loss of the services of key employees  especially our key design and technical personnel  or our inability to retain  attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to warranty claims  product recalls and product liability 
we are currently  and from time to time may be  subject to warranty or product liability claims that have lead and may in the future lead to significant expenses as we compensate affected customers for costs incurred related to product quality issues 
for example  in the second quarter of we identified a product quality issue with a particular component that we took steps to correct  including notifying our customers and offering to replace such components 
we are continuing our discussions with affected customers regarding this issue  and have compensated or otherwise rectified the issue with many of those customers 
as at october   we have recorded million in charges associated with this issue  including million in fiscal year  and may incur additional charges as we continue to work with our customers to resolve the matter 

table of contents although we maintain product liability insurance  such insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims  or we may elect to self insure with respect to certain matters 
we may incur costs and expenses in the event of any recall of a customer s product containing one of our devices 
the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources  and we may incur significant replacement costs  contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm 
costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses or undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products  damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer  may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released  or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects  bugs and delays 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  we may not be able to successfully design workarounds 
consequently  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  and our financial results 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to resolve these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
for example  if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer s product delivery  we may be required  under the terms of our agreement with that customer  to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts  and we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
as a result  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to adjust our supply chain volume due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements 
our results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our supply chain volume to address market fluctuations  including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate 
the sale of our products is dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
for example  the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile and is subject to seasonality related to the holiday selling season  making demand difficult to anticipate 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can challenge our resources and reduce margins 
during a market upturn  we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components  or secure sufficient contract manufacturing capacity  to meet increasing product demand  which could harm our reputation  prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities and reduce revenue growth 
in addition  some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work 
in order to secure components for the production of products  we may continue to enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors or make advance payments to suppliers  which could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in 
table of contents an excess of parts when demand for our products has decreased 
downturns in the semiconductor industry have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products ordered from us 
if demand for our products is less than we expect  we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 
conversely  if oems order more of our products in any particular quarter than are ultimately required to satisfy end customer demand  inventories at these oems may grow in such quarter  which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such oems would likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand 
in addition  because certain of our sales  research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income 
we are subject to currency exchange risks that could adversely affect our operations 
although a majority of our revenue and operating expenses is denominated in us dollars  and we prepare our financial statements in us dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  a portion of our revenue and operating expenses is in foreign currencies 
as a result  we are subject to currency risks that could adversely affect our operations  including risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls  and limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries 
changes in exchange rates will result in increases or decreases in our costs and earnings  and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside the united states and the amount of our equity 
although we seek to minimize our currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where we deem it appropriate  we do not know whether our efforts will be successful 
our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline 
visibility into our markets is limited 
as was the case in the recent economic downturn  any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and make it more difficult to collect on outstanding amounts due to us 
for example  if the asian market does not continue to grow as anticipated or if the semiconductor market declines  our results of operations will likely suffer 
in such an environment  pricing pressures could intensify and  if we were unable to respond quickly  could significantly reduce our gross margins 
to the extent we cannot offset recessionary periods or periods of reduced growth that may occur in these markets through increased market share or otherwise  our net revenue may decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
pricing pressures and competition are especially intense in semiconductor related industries  which could prevent achievement of our long term financial goals and could require us to implement additional cost cutting measures 
furthermore  industry growth rates may not be as forecasted  which could result in us spending on process and product development well ahead of market requirements  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the demands or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 
some of our customers are material to our business and results of operations 
during fiscal year  no customer accounted for or more of our net revenue  and our top customers  which included five distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
during fiscal year  no customer accounted for or more of our net revenue  and our top customers  which included four distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we believe our top customers purchasing power has given them the ability to make greater demands on their suppliers  including us 
we expect this trend to continue  which we expect will result in our results of operations becoming increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments related to  one or more of our significant customers 
although we believe that our relationships with our major customers are good  we generally do not have long term contracts with any of them  which is typical of our industry 
as a result  although our customers provide indications of their product needs and purchases on an annual basis  they generally purchase our products on a weekly or daily basis and the relationship  as well as 
table of contents particular orders  can be terminated at any time 
the loss of any of our major customers  or any substantial reduction in sales to any of these customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we generally do not have any long term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers or materials suppliers and may not be able to obtain the products or raw materials required for our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we either obtain the products we need for our business from third party contract manufacturers or we obtain the materials we need for our products from suppliers  some of which are our single source suppliers for these materials 
we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers 
for fiscal year  we purchased of the materials for our manufacturing processes from eight suppliers 
for fiscal year  we purchased of the materials for our manufacturing processes from eight suppliers 
substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis  and we have not generally entered into long term contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers 
in the event that these purchase orders or relationships with suppliers are terminated  we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices  the quality of the material deteriorates  we fail to satisfy our customers requirements or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our manufacturing processes rely on many materials  including silicon and gaas wafers  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
we use third party contractor manufacturers for most of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and module assembly and test services 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs  commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts and may require other commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be adversely affected in the event that these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated  our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect or capacity is consumed by our competitors 
we rely on third parties to provide corporate infrastructure services necessary for the operation of our business 
any failure of one or more of our vendors to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on third party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services  including  among other things  certain services related to accounting  billing  human resources  information technology  or it  network development and network monitoring 
we depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements 
the ability of these third party vendors to successfully provide reliable  high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control 
while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us  our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive 
in addition  we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor s failure to perform under its agreement with us 
we are currently implementing a phased migration of our data centers in singapore from one managed location to another  refreshing critical hardware and implementing centralized disaster recovery procedures 
any difficulties in the migration of certain enterprise critical applications during this process may result in short periods of downtime for these applications  which may adversely affect our ability to accept customer orders  manufacture or ship products or invoice customers during those periods 
any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third party vendors  we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms 
table of contents and conditions  including service levels and cost  that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our product mix and level of capacity utilization 
our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix  with proprietary products and products sold into our industrial and automotive target market typically providing higher gross margin than other products 
a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages 
in addition  semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  we do retain some semiconductor fabrication facilities 
if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
in the past  we have experienced periods where our gross margins declined due to  among other things  reduced factory utilization resulting from reduced customer demand  reduced selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower margin devices 
increased competition and the existence of product alternatives  more complex engineering requirements  lower demand and other factors may lead to further price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 
we sell our products throughout the world 
in addition  as at october   approximately of our employees are located outside of the united states 
multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these factors include changes in political  regulatory  legal or economic conditions  restrictive governmental actions  such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs  disruptions of capital and trading markets  changes in import or export licensing requirements  transportation delays  civil disturbances or political instability  geopolitical turmoil  including terrorism  war or political or military coups  changes in labor standards  limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property  nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets  changes in tax laws  currency fluctuations  which may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers or foreign sourced materials and services becoming more expensive for us  and difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 
a majority of our products are produced and sourced in asia  including in china  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and thailand 
any conflict or uncertainty in these countries  including due to political or civil unrest or public health or safety concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or 
table of contents sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared  it may lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country  require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross border manufacturing relationships which  in each case  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our subsidiaries may require future equity related financing  and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated 
the approvals are required from the investment commissions or similar agency of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local corporations 
our failure to obtain the required approvals and our resulting inability to provide such equity related financing or capital contributions could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we suffer loss or significant damage to our factories  facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our factories  facilities and distribution system  and those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  or other natural or man made disasters 
the majority of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in the pacific rim region  a region with above average seismic and severe weather activity 
in addition  our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations  primarily korea  malaysia  singapore  fort collins  colorado and san jose  california  with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas 
any catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of these facilities would likely disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility  and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market 
in particular  any catastrophic loss at our fort collins  colorado and singapore facilities would materially and adversely affect our business 
if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable  or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect  the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase 
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment 
for example  we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board  an agency of the government of singapore  which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax 
each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others  and may be granted  withheld  extended  modified  truncated  complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives 
in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore  we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to  among other things  maintenance of a treasury function  a corporate headquarters function  specified intellectual property activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore 
some of these operating conditions are subject to phase in periods through the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between and  subject in certain cases to potential extensions 
absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be commencing from the year of assessment 
for the fiscal years ended november   november  and october   the effect of all these tax incentives  in the aggregate  was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the tax incentives that we have negotiated in other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions 
if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive  we will lose the related tax benefits and could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and  depending on the incentive at issue  could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy 

table of contents any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements 
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority  and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences  which would increase our expenses  reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 
in addition  taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm s length basis 
due to inconsistencies in application of the arm s length standard among taxing authorities  as well as lack of adequate treaty based protection  transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could  if successful  substantially increase our income tax expense 
the enactment of legislation implementing changes in us taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
tax bills are introduced from time to time to reform us taxation of international business activities 
depending on the final form of legislation enacted  if any  these consequences may be significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities 
if any of these proposals are enacted into legislation  they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and thereby on our financial position and results of operations 
we may pursue acquisitions  dispositions  investments and joint ventures  which could affect our results of operations 
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties 
for example  the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business 
in addition  the integration may require that we incur significant restructuring charges 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our management information systems  operating systems and internal controls  and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
the difficulties of the integrations may be further complicated by such factors as geographic distances  lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business  delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses  diversion of management s attention from daily operations of the business  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business  the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business  performance problems with the acquired business technology  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition  and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition 
even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired assets 
any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities  acquire goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges  incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets  increase our expenses and working capital requirements  and subject us to litigation  which would reduce our return on invested capital 
failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make could materially harm our business and operating results 

table of contents any future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing  which  in the case of debt financing  would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings  and in the case of equity financing  would be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms 
as a result of the foregoing  we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past  or at all 
these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition  and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to various governmental regulations  and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses 
if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our business is subject to various significant international and us laws and other legal requirements  including packaging  product content  labor and import export regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to conduct our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation by other agencies  such as the us federal communications commission 
if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations  our business could be harmed 
we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  we could be required to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws  which could increase our costs  restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of international and us laws and other legal requirements relating to the use  disposal  clean up of and human exposure to  hazardous materials 
any failure by us to comply with environmental  health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to future liabilities in excess of our reserves 
in addition  compliance with environmental  health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment  incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes 
in the event of the discovery of new contamination  additional requirements with respect to existing contamination  or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible  we may be required to take remedial or other measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition of our products  including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in the european union as of july  under the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive 
other countries  such as the united states  china and japan  have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to the eu legislation 
other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible 
such reengineering and component substitution may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents in addition to the costs of complying with environmental  health and safety requirements  we may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies and private parties 
we may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
a significant judgment against us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the last few years  there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and certain illnesses  primarily different types of cancers 
regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists 
because we utilize clean rooms  we may become subject to liability claims 
in addition  these reports may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees 
we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
we have taken significant restructuring charges in the past and may need to take material restructuring charges in the future 
during fiscal year  we pursued a number of restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations  in large part due to the global economic downturn and related decline in demand for our customers products 
these initiatives included significant workforce reductions in certain areas as we realigned our business  establishing certain operations closer in location to our global customers  evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and steps to attempt to further reduce our overhead costs 
as a result of these initiatives  we incurred restructuring charges of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we may be required to take additional charges in the future as we continue to evaluate our operations and cost structures relative to general economic conditions  market demands  cost competitiveness  and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers production requirements 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or amount of any future restructuring charges 
if we are required to take additional restructuring charges in the future  our operating results  financial condition  and cash flows may be adversely impacted 
additionally  there are other potential risks associated with our restructurings that could adversely affect us  such as delays encountered with the finalization and implementation of the restructuring activities  work stoppages  and the failure to achieve targeted cost savings 
we are subject to risks associated with our distributors product inventories and product sell through 
we sell many of our products to customers through distributors who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users 
we recognize revenues for sales to distributors upon delivery to the distributor 
we limit distributor return rights and we allow limited price adjustments on sales to distributors 
we provide reserves for distributor rights related to these limited stock returns and price adjustments 
sales to distributors accounted for and of our net revenue for the fiscal years and  respectively 
if these distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any reason  such as due to the recent global recession or due to any downturn in technology spending  our sales to these distributors and our revenues may decline 
in addition  if distributors decide to purchase more inventory in any particular quarter  due to product 
table of contents availability or other reasons  than is required to satisfy end customer demand  inventory at our distributors may grow in such quarter  which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such distributors will likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand 
for example  during the fiscal year ended november   and in particular during the first fiscal quarter of that year  the semiconductor industry experienced a significant decline in demand 
consequently  our distributors experienced declines in their resales of our products and were carrying a higher level of inventories of our products than historical levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year as a result  our distributors reduced their inventory of our products during the second fiscal quarter of and we also reduced our own inventory by million or in that quarter 
we also face the risk that our distributors may for other reasons have inventory levels of our products in excess of future anticipated sales 
if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these distributors for any reason  these distributors may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods  which would harm our business 
our reserve estimates associated with products stocked by our distributors are based largely on reports that our distributors provide to us on a monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been generally accurate 
to the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner  we may not be able to make reserve estimates for future periods accurately or at all 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives  as well as our employee sales representatives  and the failure of these representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
we sell many of our products to customers through distributors and manufacturers representatives  as well as through our employee sales representatives 
we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our distributors and manufacturers representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products 
our relationships with our representatives and distributors may be terminated by either party at any time 
as part of a change in strategy  in order to more effectively manage sales representatives performance  we recently terminated our relationships with a substantial number of our manufacturing representatives in the united states and have replaced them with additional employee representatives 
we continue to evaluate our sales strategy and may make further changes in the future  which may include terminating additional manufacturing representatives 
our future performance will depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products  and on our ability to effectively transition sales efforts from our terminated us manufacturing representatives to our employee sales representatives 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives or recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives  or effectively manage the transition from our terminated us manufacturing representatives to our employee sales representatives  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
we continue to adjust our sales strategy regarding the use of manufacturing representatives and direct sales employees as needed 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
gross profits on our products may be negatively affected by  among other things  pricing pressures from our customers  and the proportion of sales of our wireless and other products into consumer application markets  which are highly competitive and cost sensitive 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing manufacturing costs  or developing new and higher value added products on a timely basis 

table of contents we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our share price 
we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly 
as required  we complied with section under the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended  or the sarbanes oxley act  for fiscal year even though our system of internal controls has achieved compliance with section  we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes as our business changes and we rearrange management responsibilities and reorganize our business accordingly 
this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section is expensive  time consuming and requires significant management attention 
we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section furthermore  as our business changes and as we acquire other companies  our internal controls may become more complex and we may require more resources to ensure they remain effective 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline 
remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected  our access to the capital markets may be restricted  the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline  and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  including the sec or the nasdaq global select market 
we may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 
we have a million revolving credit facility of which million is currently available for borrowings 
borrowings under our senior credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
subject to restrictions in our senior credit agreement  we may incur additional indebtedness 
while we have recently significantly reduced the amount of our indebtedness by redeeming and repurchasing all of our previously outstanding notes in and  if we were to borrow substantial amounts under our revolving credit facility or otherwise incur significant additional indebtedness  it could have important consequences including increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness  exposing us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness  limiting our ability to  or increasing the costs to  refinance indebtedness  and 
table of contents making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes 
any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our senior credit agreement imposes significant restrictions on our business 
our senior credit agreement contains a number of covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business 
these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
the restrictions placed on us include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue ordinary or preferred shares  pay dividends or make other distributions on  redeem or repurchase our shares or make other restricted payments  make investments  acquisitions  loans or advances  incur or create liens  transfer or sell certain assets  engage in sale and lease back transactions  declare dividends or make other payments to us  guarantee indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  over a specified limit  our senior credit agreement requires us to meet a financial ratio test and restricts our ability to make capital expenditures or prepay certain other indebtedness 
our ability to meet the financial ratio test may be affected by events beyond our control  and we do not know whether we will be able to maintain this ratio 
the foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in market conditions or our capital needs 
we do not know whether we will be granted waivers under  or amendments to  our senior credit agreement if for any reason we are unable to meet these requirements  or whether we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under our senior credit agreement 
if we are unable to repay amounts due under the credit facility when due or in the event of a default  the lenders under our senior credit agreement could proceed against the collateral securing that debt 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to investments in singapore companies it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of us courts for civil liabilities under us federal securities laws against us  our directors or officers in singapore 
we are incorporated under the laws of the republic of singapore  and certain of our officers and directors are or will be residents outside the united states 
moreover  a majority of our consolidated assets are located outside the united states 
although we are incorporated outside the united states  we have agreed to accept service of process in the united states through our agent designated for that purpose 
nevertheless  since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us are located outside the united states  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states 
there is no treaty between the united states and singapore providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for the payment of money rendered 
table of contents by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws  would  therefore  not be automatically enforceable in singapore 
there is doubt whether a singapore court may impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers who reside in singapore in a suit brought in the singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal securities laws of the united states  unless the facts surrounding such a violation would constitute or give rise to a cause of action under singapore law 
consequently  it may be difficult for investors to enforce against us  our directors or our officers in singapore judgments obtained in the united states which are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
we are incorporated in singapore and our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in singapore 
the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of the members of our board of directors under singapore law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states 
therefore  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest in connection with actions taken by our management  members of our board of directors or our controlling shareholder than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 
for example  controlling shareholders in us corporations are subject to fiduciary duties while controlling shareholders in singapore corporations are not subject to such duties 
please see comparison of shareholder rights in the definitive proxy statement for our annual general meeting 
for a limited period of time  our directors have general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as may be determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion 
under singapore law  we may only allot and issue new shares with the prior approval of our shareholders in a general meeting 
at our annual general meeting of shareholders  our shareholders provided our directors with the general authority to allot and issue any number of new ordinary shares until the earlier of i the conclusion of our annual general meeting  ii the expiration of the period within which the next annual general meeting is required to be held ie  within months from the conclusion of the last general meeting or iii the subsequent revocation or modification of such general authority by our shareholders acting at a duly noticed and convened meeting 
subject to the general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares provided by our shareholders  the provisions of the singapore companies act and our memorandum and articles of association  our board of directors may allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as they may think fit to impose 
any additional issuances of new ordinary shares by our directors may adversely impact the market price of our ordinary shares

in addition  pursuant to the terms of our second amended and restated shareholder agreement  or the shareholder agreement  kkr and silver lake together  the sponsors  or their respective affiliates  and seletar  can elect their respective designees to serve as members of our board of directors 
these shareholders will have a continuing ability to control our board of directors and will continue to have significant influence over our affairs for the foreseeable future  including controlling the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets 
this concentrated control will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters and  as a result  we may take actions that our non sponsor shareholders do not view as beneficial 
for example  this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares 

table of contents prior to december  we were a controlled company under the rules of the nasdaq global select market  as bali  seletar and geyser  together referred to as the sponsor group  elected to file as a group with the sec  with respect to their collective ownership of our shares 
as of december   the sponsor group ceased to own a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares  and we ceased to be a controlled company under the rules of the nasdaq global select market 
as a result  our board of directors will be required to be composed of a majority of independent directors and our compensation committee and our nominating and corporate governance committee will be required to be comprised entirely of independent directors  subject to applicable transition periods prescribed by the nasdaq global select market 
at times  our share price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future  which could result in substantial losses for our investors 
the trading price of our ordinary shares has at times fluctuated significantly 
our ordinary shares have traded as high as per share and as low as per share since our initial public offering  or ipo  in august the trading price of our ordinary shares could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this risk factors section  and others  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results  overall conditions in the semiconductor market and general economic and market conditions  addition or loss of significant customers  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products  actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors  announcements of technological innovations or competitive products by us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies  announcement of  or expectation of additional financing efforts  sales of our ordinary shares by us or our shareholders  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  and changes in our dividend policy 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares 
you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
there has been a public market for our ordinary shares for only a short period of time 
an active  liquid and orderly market for our ordinary shares may not develop or be sustained  which could depress the trading price of our 
table of contents ordinary shares 
an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  or publish negative reports about our business  our share price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our ordinary shares depends  in part  on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not have any control over these analysts 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares  our share price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline 
future sales of our ordinary shares in the public market could cause our share price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the public market  or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our ordinary shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
as of december   approximately million outstanding ordinary shares are subject to the contractual transfer restrictions in our shareholder agreement  which is described under certain relationships and related party transactions second amended and restated shareholder agreement transfer restrictions in the definitive proxy statement for our annual general meeting of shareholders 
these shares are also subject to lock up agreements that holders of the shares have signed with the underwriter of the secondary offering of our ordinary shares that was completed on december   under which they have agreed not to sell  transfer or dispose of  directly or indirectly  any shares of our ordinary shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for ordinary shares without the prior written consent of deutsche bank securities until january   subject to a possible extension under certain circumstances 
the underwriter of this offering may  in its sole discretion  release all or some portion of the shares subject to the day lock up agreements prior to expiration of such period  and the company and the sponsors may decide to waive the restrictions in the shareholder agreement 
an aggregate of approximately million shares  as of august   and additional shares subject to options of which million were vested and exercisable as of august   held by certain employees and former employees were subject to transfer restrictions  pursuant to the terms of the management shareholders agreement  or management shareholders agreement  to which they were party 
the management shareholders agreements  and the share transfer restrictions contained therein  were terminated with effect from september  as a result  these shares have become generally available for sale  subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy 
as of december   holders of approximately million ordinary shares are entitled to rights with respect to registration of such shares under the securities act pursuant to a registration rights agreement 
if such holders  by exercising their registration rights  sell a large number of shares  they could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares 
if we register the sale of additional shares to raise capital  and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights  our ability to raise capital may be impaired 
in addition  shares issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans may be freely sold in the public market upon vesting and issuance  subject to the restrictions provided under the terms of the plan under which they were issued and or the option agreements entered into with option holders 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or declare them in any particular amounts 
notwithstanding that we recently adopted a cash dividend policy  and have declared our first interim cash dividend of per share  payable on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business pm  eastern time  on december   there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in 
table of contents the future or in any particular amounts 
the actual declaration and payment of any future dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend policy could change at any time 
the payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit agreement  applicable law and our corporate structure 
pursuant to singapore law and our articles of association  no dividends may be paid except out of our profits 
also  because we are a holding company  our ability to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries  including restrictions under the terms of our credit agreement 
in addition to these constraints  the payment of cash dividends in the future  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as our earnings levels  capital requirements  contractual restrictions  cash position and overall financial condition and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
furthermore  any such dividend  if declared  may be an interim dividend  under singapore law  which is wholly provisional and may be revoked by our board of directors at any time prior to the payment thereof 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources  divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act  listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market and other applicable securities rules and regulations 
compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs  make some activities more difficult  time consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources 
the exchange act requires  among other things  that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and  if required  improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard  significant resources and management oversight may be required 
as a result  management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need to hire more employees in the future  which will increase our costs and expenses 
furthermore  as we grow our business or acquire new businesses  our internal controls will become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls overall remain effective 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
in addition  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and  as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed 
being a public company makes it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on committees of our board of directors  and qualified executive officers 

table of contents singapore corporate law may impede a takeover of our company by a third party  which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 
the singapore code on take overs and mergers contains provisions that may delay  deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of our company for so long as we remain a public company with more than shareholders and net tangible assets of s million or more 
any person acquiring an interest  whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not  either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person  in or more of our voting shares  or  if such person holds  either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person  between and both inclusive of our voting shares  and such person or parties acting in concert with such person acquires additional voting shares representing more than of our voting shares in any six month period  must  except with the consent of the securities industry council in singapore  extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the singapore code on take overs and mergers 
while the singapore code on take overs and mergers seeks to ensure equality of treatment among shareholders  its provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control of our company 
these legal requirements may impede or delay a takeover of our company by a third party  which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 
our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 
from time to time  we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release 
this guidance  which consists of forward looking statements  is prepared by our management and is qualified by  and subject to  the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release 
our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants  and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and  accordingly  no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 
guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that  while presented with numerical specificity  is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions  some of which will change 
we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges 
the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors 
we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 
guidance is necessarily speculative in nature  and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results 
accordingly  our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release 
actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material 
investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast 
in light of the foregoing  investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 
any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance  and such differences may be adverse and material

as of the date of this filing  we are not involved in any pending legal proceedings that we believe would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  certain pending disputes involve claims by third parties that our activities infringe their patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights 
these claims generally involve the demand by a third party that we cease the manufacture  use or sale of the allegedly infringing products  processes or technologies and or pay substantial damages or royalties for past  present and future use of the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
for example  on july   triquint semiconductor  inc filed a complaint against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the us district court  district of arizona seeking declaratory judgment that four of our patents relating to rf filter technology used in our wireless products are invalid and  if valid  that triquint s products do not infringe any of those patents 
triquint has subsequently withdrew those claims with respect to three of those four patents 
in addition  triquint claims that certain of our wireless products infringe three of its patents 
triquint is seeking damages in an unspecified amount  treble damages for alleged willful infringement  attorneys fees and injunctive relief 
we filed our answer and initial counterclaim on september   denying infringement  asserting the invalidity of triquint s patents and asserting infringement by triquint of ten avago patents and filed additional counterclaims on march  for the misappropriation of avago trade secrets 
on october   triquint filed its answer to our initial counterclaim  denying infringement and filed an antitrust counterclaim and counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity 
while the court dismissed triquint s antitrust counterclaims on procedural grounds on march   triquint has since filed a motion to file an amended pleading for its anti trust claims  which was granted on august  we intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously  and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional claims or counterclaims against triquint related to our intellectual property portfolio 

table of contents in addition  on february   pixart imaging inc filed an action against us in the u 
s district court  northern district of california seeking a determination of whether pixart is licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products pursuant to an existing cross license agreement between us and pixart  which license is limited to optical mouse and optical mouse trackball products 
we did not license to pixart our patents for optical finger navigation products 
we intend to defend this action vigorously and to seek to have the scope of the cross license agreement properly construed by the court as excluding such products 
we also filed a counterclaim against pixart on march   asserting that pixart has breached the terms of the cross license agreement between the parties 
we are seeking a determination that pixart is not licensed to use our portfolio of patents for optical finger navigation products  damages in an unspecified amount  termination for breach  or rescission  of the license agreement and attorneys fees 
on march  we filed a patent infringement action against st microelectronics nv in the eastern district of texas for infringement of four of our patents related to optical navigation devices 
we amended the complaint on july  adding infringement of a fifth optical navigation related patent to the action 
we are seeking injunctive relief  damages in an unspecified amount  treble damages for willful infringement and attorneys fees 
in response  st microelectronics filed a patent infringement action against us in the northern district of texas alleging that our sales of certain optical navigation devices infringed two st microelectronics patents 
st microelectronics is seeking injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount 
st microelectronics filed a second suit against us on november  in the northern district of california alleging certain anticompetitive actions by us in the optical navigation sensor market 
st microelectronics is seeking injunctive and compensatory relief under the sherman act and the clayton act and attorneys fees 
we have not yet filed our response 
we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously  and future actions may include the assertion by us of additional claims or counterclaims against st microelectronics related to our intellectual property portfolio 
claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate any third party intellectual property rights including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers often involve highly complex  technical issues  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain 
moreover  from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights 
regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation  complex intellectual property litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel

our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices with a focus on iii v based products 
we differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities 
iii v semiconductor materials have higher electrical conductivity  enabling faster speeds and tend to have better performance characteristics than conventional silicon in applications such as rf and 
table of contents optoelectronics 
our product portfolio is extensive and includes over  products that we sell into four primary target markets wireless communications  wired infrastructure  industrial and automotive electronics  and consumer and computing peripherals 
applications for our products in these target markets include cellular phones  consumer appliances  data networking and telecommunications equipment  enterprise storage and servers  renewable energy and smart power grid applications  factory automation  displays  optical mice and printers 
we have a nearly year history of innovation dating back to our origins within hewlett packard company 
over the years  we have assembled a large team of analog design engineers  and we maintain design and product development engineering resources around the world 
our locations include two design centers in the united states  five in asia and four in europe 
we have developed an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that currently includes more than  us and foreign patents and patent applications 
our history and market position enable us to strategically focus our research and development resources to address attractive target markets 
we leverage our significant intellectual property portfolio to integrate multiple technologies and create component solutions that target growth opportunities 
we design products that deliver high performance and provide mission critical functionality 
in particular  we were a pioneer in commercializing vertical cavity surface emitting laser  or vcsel  fiber optic products and our vcsel based products have been widely adopted throughout the wired infrastructure industry 
in addition  we were among the first to deliver commercial film bulk acoustic resonator  or fbar  filters for code division multiple access  or cdma  technology and we believe we maintain a significant market share of pcs duplexers within the cdma market 
in addition  our fbar filters offer technological advantages over competing filters in certain other radio bands  such as gps and g 
in optoelectronics  we are a market leader in submarkets such as optocouplers  fiber optic transceivers  optical finger navigation sensors found in mobile phones and optical computer mouse sensors 
we have a diversified and well established customer base of approximately  end customers  located throughout the world  which we serve through our multi channel sales and fulfillment system 
we have established strong relationships with leading original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers across multiple target markets 
typically  our major customer relationships have been in place multiple years and we have supplied multiple products during that time period 
our close customer relationships have often been built as a result of years of collaborative product development which has enabled us to build our intellectual property portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customer s requirements  including substantial system level knowledge 
this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers 
we distribute most of our products through our broad distribution network  and we are a significant supplier to two of the largest global electronic components distributors  avnet  inc and arrow electronics  inc we also have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems 
for the year ended october   our top customers  which included five distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable  low cost operating model 
accordingly  we have outsourced a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing third party foundry and assembly and test capabilities  as well as most of our corporate infrastructure functions we aim to minimize capital expenditures by focusing our internal manufacturing capacity on products utilizing our innovative materials and processes to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing  while outsourcing standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
we also have over years of operating history in asia  where approximately of our employees are located and where we produce and source the majority of our products 
our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing 
our business is impacted by general conditions of the semiconductor industry and seasonal demand patterns in our target markets 
we believe that our focus on multiple target markets and geographies helps mitigate our exposure to volatility in any single target market 
erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry 
consistent with trends in the industry  we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to decline in the future 
however  as part of our normal course of business  we plan to offset declining average selling prices with efforts to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products and the introduction of new and higher value added products 

table of contents historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue 
sales to distributors accounted for and of our net revenue for the years ended november  and october   respectively 
in the year ended november   our top customers  which included four distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
no customer accounted for or more of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended november  during the fiscal year ended october   our top customers  which included five distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
no customer accounted for or more of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended october  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and is likely to continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including the following general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders and our ability to manage inventory  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
the recent economic downturn and financial crisis negatively affected our business during fiscal year  although the global economy improved during fiscal year  current uncertainty in global economic conditions still poses potential risks to our business 
for example  customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news  which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations 
net revenue substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices which our customers incorporate into electronic products 
we serve four primary target markets wireless communications  wired infrastructure  industrial and automotive electronics  and consumer and computing peripherals 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force 
we also use distributors for a portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors 
such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 
costs and expenses total cost of products sold 
cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials  and the cost of assembly and test 
cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations  including share based compensation  and related occupancy  computer services and equipment costs  manufacturing quality  order fulfillment  warranty and inventory adjustments  including write downs for inventory obsolescence  energy costs and other manufacturing expenses 
total cost of products sold also includes amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges 
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  we do retain some semiconductor fabrication and assembly and test facilities 
if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication and assembly and test facilities at a desired level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies  including share based compensation 
these expenses also include project material costs  third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel  including share based compensation  sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives  costs of advertising  trade shows  corporate marketing  promotion  travel related to our sales and marketing operations  related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management  finance  human resources and other administrative personnel  outside professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses 
in connection with our ipo  during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we expensed million related to the termination of the advisory agreement with our sponsors as well as approximately million of offering costs incurred in our ipo that relate to selling shareholders which were absorbed by us 
amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with acquisitions  we recorded intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of six months to years 
in connection with these acquisitions  we also recorded goodwill which is not being amortized 
interest expense 
interest expense is associated with our borrowings incurred in connection with the spg acquisition 
our debt has been substantially reduced over the past four fiscal years  principally through net proceeds derived from the divestiture of our storage and printer asics businesses as well as cash flows from operations  and through the use of the net proceeds from our ipo 
gain loss on extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the repurchase or redemption of our outstanding indebtedness  we incur a gain loss on the extinguishment of debt 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net includes interest income  currency gains losses on balance sheet remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment 
for example  we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board  an agency of the government of singapore  which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax 
each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others  and may be granted  withheld  extended  modified  truncated  complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives 
in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore  we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to  among other things  maintenance of a treasury function  a corporate headquarters function  specified intellectual property activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore 
some of these operating conditions are subject to phase in periods through the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between and  subject in certain cases to potential extensions 
absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be commencing from the year of assessment 
for the fiscal years ended november   november  and october   the effect of all these tax incentives  in the aggregate  was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the tax incentives that we have negotiated in other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions 
if we cannot or elect not to comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive  we will lose the related tax benefits and could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and  depending on the incentive at issue  could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy 
any such modified structure may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements 
as a result of the tax incentives and tax holidays  if we continue to comply with the operating conditions  we expect the income from our operations to be subject to relatively lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary income tax rules 
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority  and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences  which would increase our expenses  reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 
in addition  taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm s length basis 
due to inconsistencies in application of the arm s length standard 
table of contents among taxing authorities  as well as lack of adequate treaty based protection  transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could  if successful  substantially increase our income tax expense 
going forward  our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
in particular  we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis  potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods 
conversely  we expect to realize more favorable effective tax rates as our profitability increases 
our historical income tax provisions are not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations 
history spg acquisition on december   we completed the acquisition of the semiconductor products group of agilent for approximately billion 
the spg acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
among other things  the purchase accounting adjustments increased the carrying value of our inventory and property  plant and equipment  and established intangible assets for our developed technology  customer and distributorship relationships  order backlog  and in process research and development  or iprd 
as a result of the spg acquisition and related borrowings  interest expense and non cash depreciation and amortization charges have significantly increased 
acquisitions in fiscal years  and we completed five acquisitions for aggregate cash consideration of million during the first quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of a privately held manufacturer of motion control encoders for million net of cash acquired of million plus million repayment of existing debt 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of a privately held developer of low power wireless devices for million  plus potential earn out payments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of the bulk acoustic wave filter business of infineon technologies ag for million in cash 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of a manufacturer of motion control encoders for million in cash 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of a manufacturer of motion control encoders for million in cash 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies and businesses commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
see note acquisitions and investments  in the consolidated financial statements for information related to these acquisitions 
restructuring charges in fiscal year  we began to increase the use of outsourced service providers in our manufacturing operations  particularly our assembly and test operations  to lower our costs and reduce the capital deployed in these activities 
in connection with this strategy  we introduced a largely voluntary severance program intended to reduce our workforce and resulting in an approximately decline in our headcount during fiscal year  primarily in our major locations in asia 
consequently  during the year ended november   we incurred total restructuring charges of million  predominantly representing one time employee termination costs 

table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring plan intended to realign our cost structure with the then prevailing macroeconomic business conditions 
this plan eliminated approximately positions or of our global workforce and was substantially completed in fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal year  we announced a further reduction in our worldwide workforce of up to employees 
this plan was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the year ended november   we recorded restructuring charges of million in connection with both of these plans  predominantly representing one time employee termination costs 
in fiscal year  we also committed to a plan to outsource certain of our manufacturing in germany 
during the year ended november   we recorded million of one time employee termination costs  million related to asset abandonment and other exit costs and approximately million related to excess lease costs in connection with this plan 
during fiscal year  we recorded and paid million of one time employee termination costs and recognized million as share based compensation expense in connection with the departure of our former chief operating officer in january as part of our efforts to continue to realign our cost structure  we incurred approximately million of one time employee termination costs and million of excess lease costs during fiscal year see note restructuring charges to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies include revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  inventory valuation and warranty reserves and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  net of sales returns and allowances  provided that i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments or when any such adjustments are accounted for 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance of an order 
revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors  is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 
we recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors 
an allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments and scrap allowances is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms 
to date  actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review of our long lived and intangible assets include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
table of contents and significant negative industry or economic trends 
an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book values of the asset or asset group and its their estimated fair value 
we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist and we follow the two step approach in performing the impairment test in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the related carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes which is based on the manner in which we operate our business and the nature of those operations  including consideration of how the chief operating decision maker  as defined in asc segment reporting  manages the business as a whole 
we operate as one semiconductor company with sales of semiconductors representing the only material source of revenue 
substantially all products offered incorporate analog functionality and are manufactured under similar manufacturing processes 
for fiscal year  we used the quoted market price of our ordinary shares to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  which is the company as a whole 
no impairment of goodwill was identified based on the annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year a decline in the ordinary share quoted market prices would not impact the result of our goodwill impairment assessment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets under asc property  plant and equipment  such as our property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long lived asset relates to  consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business  which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long lived asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
inventory valuation and warranty reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in 
table of contents extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our gross profit and gross margins would be reduced 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes  or asc the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determine  in the future  a valuation allowance is required  such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
conversely  if we determine  in the future  a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement  such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
total unrecognized tax benefits increased by million during fiscal year  resulting in total unrecognized tax benefits of million as of november  the total unrecognized tax benefit increased to approximately million as of october  we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for benefit from income taxes line in the consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the other current liabilities and other long term liabilities lines in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of november   november  and october   the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
share based compensation 
we measure and recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards issued to employees and directors in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under the authoritative guidance  for option awards granted or modified after november   we recognize compensation expense based on estimated fair values on the date of grant  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
compensation expense for share based awards granted after november   is recognized over the requisite service period of the award on a straight line basis 
forfeiture rates used in the determination of compensation expense are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on share based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
for outstanding performance share based awards granted before november  and not modified thereafter  we continue to account for any portion of such awards under the originally applied accounting principles 
performance based awards granted before november  were subject to variable accounting until such options are modified  vested  forfeited or cancelled 
variable accounting requires us to value the variable options at the end of each accounting period based upon the then current fair value of the underlying ordinary 
table of contents shares 
accordingly  our share based compensation expense was subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in the fair value of our ordinary shares and our estimate of vesting probability of unvested performance based options 
however  subsequent to november   the compensation committee approved two modifications of all outstanding employee performance based awards 
as a result of the first modification in fiscal year  all variable accounting on outstanding employee performance based options ceased and instead  pursuant to the authoritative guidance  we recognized a combination of unamortized intrinsic value of these modified options and the incremental fair value of those options up until the date of the second modification in fiscal year in accordance with the authoritative guidance  at the second modification date  we measured the incremental fair value of unvested outstanding performance based options  that is expected to be recognized over the remaining service period and are recognizing that amount on a straight line basis over such expected service period 
for options granted or modified after november   we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for share options 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions  such as future share price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
we also estimate potential forfeitures of share grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change  and the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in future periods is adjusted 
the weighted average assumptions utilized for our black scholes valuation model for options and employee share purchase rights granted during the fiscal years ended november   november  and october  are as follows espp year ended year ended november  november  october  october  risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility expected term in years the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we had not declared any cash dividends as of the respective option grant date 
volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of guideline publicly traded companies over the period commensurate with the expected term of the options and the implied volatility of guideline publicly traded companies from traded options with a term of days or greater measured over the last three months 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury strips rate during the period  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant 
for all options granted after august  and a portion of options granted before august   our computation of expected term was based on other data  such as the data of peer companies and company specific attributes that we believe could affect employees exercise behavior 
for the majority of options granted prior to august   we used the simplified method as specified in the accounting guidance 
in fiscal year  we began to grant restricted share units  or rsus  which are restricted shares that are granted with the exercise price equal to zero and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting 
we recognize compensation expense for rsus using the straight line amortization method based on the fair value of rsus on the date of grant 
the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant  which is equal to their intrinsic value on the date of grant 
we also record share based compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of rights to purchase ordinary shares under the avago employee share purchase plan  which was implemented in june  and recognize this share based compensation expense using the straight line amortization method

this accrual increased cost of products sold and research and development expenses for the year ended november  by million each and increased net loss for the year by million 
we determined that the impact of the adjustment was not material to prior periods or to the results for the second quarter of fiscal year  and as such the adjustment was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year under asc interim reporting 
net revenue 
net revenue was  million for the year ended october   compared to  million for the year ended november   an increase of million or 
this year over year increase was due  in large part  to the improvement in global economic conditions that occurred during this period  but also due to our introduction of a number of new  proprietary products over the year  which helped us to grow net revenues substantially over the period

revenue from this target market decreased as a percentage of net revenue due to the disproportionate growth in revenues from the industrial and automotive electronics target market 
net revenue from industrial and automotive electronics products  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue  substantially increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the increase was in large part due to the effects of a recovery in market conditions from fiscal year the growth in this target market was broad based  with particular strength in sales of optocouplers  industrial fiber optic transceivers and motion encoders 
we benefitted from increased spending on and new uses for our devices in applications such as inverters  servo machine tools and programmable logic controller fieldbus industrial data communications systems used in power production and distribution  including renewable energy and smart power grid installations  factory automation and transportation applications  as well as gains in market share for a number of these products 
we believe a substantial amount of the demand for these products was driven by spending on infrastructure in emerging economies 
net revenue from wired infrastructure products  in absolute dollars  increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  as spending on enterprise networking data centers and core routing improved and also due  in part  to gains in market share 
wired networking continued to benefit from increasing demand for data traffic  generating increased demand for fiber optic based networking connections to replace copper based connections and generating increased demand for higher speed serdes communications links 
net revenue from consumer and computing peripheral products  in absolute dollars  increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  reflecting improved sales of optical sensors used in optical mice and improved sales of motion encoders used in applications such as optical disc drives and printers during fiscal year however  this target market continues to be adversely affected by ongoing weakness in consumer spending and we did not experience the usual seasonal benefits in our personal computer related businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents the categorization of revenue by target market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product  the sold to customer information  the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated 
as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve  the categorization of products by target market can vary over time

principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due and payable in full on december  borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus  at our option  either a a base rate determined by reference to the higher of the united states prime rate and the federal funds rate plus or an equivalent base rate for loans originating outside the united states  to the extent available or b a libor rate or the equivalent thereof in the relevant jurisdiction determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs 
at october   the lender s base rate was and the one month libor rate was 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility is with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility with respect to any unutilized commitments thereunder 
at october  and november   the commitment fee on the revolving credit facility was per annum 
we must also pay customary letter of credit fees 
the commitment fee is expensed as additional interest expense 
the senior credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility has various limitations on certain transactions that may occur  including limitations on incurrence of additional debt  issuance of preferred shares  creation of liens  sale leaseback transactions  mergers and consolidations  asset sales  payment of dividends or distribution  share repurchases  restricted payments  investments  loans or advances  capital expenditures  repayment of or material amendments to the agreements governing our subordinated indebtedness  making certain

all obligations under the revolving credit facility  and the guarantees of those obligations  are secured by substantially all of our assets and that of each guarantor subsidiary  subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  the senior credit agreement requires us to maintain senior secured leverage ratios not exceeding levels set forth in the senior credit agreement 
the senior credit agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default including a cross default triggered by certain events of default under our other material debt instruments 
we were in compliance with all our covenants under the senior credit agreement at october  contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table sets forth our long term debt  operating and capital lease and purchase obligations as of october  for the fiscal periods noted in millions to to total thereafter current portion of long term debt estimated future interest expense and redemption premium payments operating leases capital leases commitments to contract manufacturers and other purchase obligations additional contractual commitments represents our outstanding notes as of october  subsequent to that date  we redeemed the remaining million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes  including the obligation to pay interest thereon

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
in addition to the above  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts in conjunction with our write down of inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was million 
these amounts are included in other liabilities in our balance sheets at october   and are excluded from the preceding table 

table of contents we have entered into several agreements related to outsourced it  human resources  financial advisory services and other services agreements 
we adopted the provisions of asc income taxes on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on november  due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at october   we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits classified as long term income tax payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of october  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements at october  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
indemnifications to hewlett packard and agilent agilent technologies  inc has given multiple indemnities to hewlett packard company in connection with its activities prior to its spin off from hewlett packard company in june for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spin off 
as the successor to the spg business of agilent  we may acquire responsibility for indemnifications related to assigned intellectual property agreements 
additionally  when we completed the spg acquisition in december  we provided indemnities to agilent with regard to agilent s conduct of the spg business prior to the spg acquisition 
in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 
other indemnifications as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the united states and other jurisdictions  many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers  as well as our suppliers  contractors  lessors  lessees  companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts  against combinations of loss  expense  or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products  the use of their goods and services  the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities  the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts  usually up to a specified maximum amount 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material

our revenues  costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
to mitigate the exposures resulting from the changes in the exchange rates of these currencies  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these exposures 
contracts that meet accounting criteria are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures  which include committed and anticipated transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the 
table of contents assessment of the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction  matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction  and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within three to six months 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as of october   there were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 
losses from foreign currency transactions  as well as derivative instruments  are included in our consolidated statements of operations in the amounts of million  million and million  for the years ended november   november   and october  interest rate risk borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to floating rates of interest  based on  at our option  either a lender s base rate determined by reference to the higher of the united states prime rate and the federal funds rate plus or an equivalent base rate for loans originating outside the united states  to the extent available or b a libor rate or the equivalent thereof in the relevant jurisdiction
