on december   we sold the assets of our construction trailer business 
the results of this business were formerly consolidated within our awp segment 

table of contents see note d discontinued operations in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our discontinued operations 
in december  we completed the sale of our power buggy product line  and in january  we completed the sale of our generator product line 
both of these product lines were not significant to our operations and were included in our awp segment 
included in eliminations corporate are the eliminations among the four segments  as well as certain general and corporate expenses that have not been allocated to the segments 
overview for terex  and for our broader industry  was a year of significant challenges  changes and transformation 
it was a year that saw our net sales fall in continuing operations and profitability quickly swing from an operating profit of million in to a million loss in our efforts during were clearly focused on cash generation and cost reduction to position us to take advantage of our strengthened core businesses as we look forward to and beyond 
to that end  we were pleased that during  we generated million in cash from inventory reductions 
it was a year that saw us realign our businesses to reduce capacity  cut costs and substantially decrease the number of global team members in our organization  a necessary step to size the organization for the current environment 
it was a very difficult year  but we expect to emerge as a stronger and more focused company as a result 
as we enter  we are beginning to see reasons for optimism 
our factories have begun to produce close to end market demand on a more consistent basis  with this fact alone driving significant improvement in year over year operating results 
our customers are seeing their current situations stabilize  and some are increasingly more positive about the future 
we believe this will begin to favorably influence our short cycle product categories  as we begin to see a pickup in activity in our compact construction and materials processing businesses  for example 
while not the most reliable indicator of the future  we did see sequential improvement in our backlog in three of our four segments  which is a favorable sign 
in the short term  we expect the challenging environment to continue 
however  we also believe that the present situation offers us the opportunity to strengthen and improve on our business positions around the world 
we approach the future with the goal of transforming terex from what historically has been predominately a construction and mining equipment company to a more diverse manufacturer of a variety of machinery and industrial products 
the recently completed divestiture of the mining business is an example of this portfolio management strategy  that is  doing what is right for the business  our customers and our shareholders  while unlocking significant value for terex 
this will allow us to redeploy the capital into new opportunities that fit our desired high return on capital profile 
our acquisition strategy will include a focus on product niches with leading market positions 
our new venture into the port equipment business is an example of acquiring a leader in a niche category that diversifies our end market exposure away from construction building cycles 
our performance reflected both the continued soft demand environment and our ongoing global restructuring effort 
most of our factories worked on reduced schedules during  continuing with a build to order approach targeted at reducing inventory levels 
overall  we have made significant progress in reducing our inventory company wide  generating million in cash flows from inventory reductions during looking forward  we are targeting appropriate working capital levels to meet future sales levels 
we will need to produce for new orders in  which will lead to significant year over year improvement in profitability  as we will be better positioned to absorb the fixed costs and overhead of our businesses 
additionally  during  we announced the closure of several facilities as we strived to lower costs and consolidate capacity 
while closing an operation is always a difficult decision  these actions were necessary steps to reduce our operating costs in line with our current net sales level 
we continue to look to improve our global manufacturing footprint through consolidation of capacity  as well as developing new facilities in growth markets  such as india  china and brazil 
our expansion capital will primarily focus on strengthening our franchise in the developing markets around the world  as these markets continue to lead recovery in the global economy and are anticipated to grow for years to come 
the construction segment  while evidencing improved performance over recent financial quarters  still generated a large operating loss during finished goods levels for our construction segment  and the construction industry as a whole  continue to decline  which should help to lessen pricing pressure in  as results for this segment were negatively impacted by pricing pressures 
the balance of our businesses posted mixed results in  with the cranes segment generating modest profitability 
the crane business remains generally healthy  with high capacity crane products continuing to generate orders  but with some softening expected year over year as we look into the awp segment continues to feel pressure from the fleet reduction actions of its rental customer base  and we expect that this trend will continue until utilization rates improve 
the materials processing mp segment s bookings continue to improve slightly when compared to recent activity levels  with expectations for modest recovery in the second half of 
table of contents given current market conditions  it is difficult to project performance with any reasonable degree of certainty 
however  we are planning for flat to slightly improved demand in most of our product categories  with the exception of some softening in the large crane business 
our backlog has stabilized  and our order inquiry rate has picked up 
based on what we see today  we expect our net sales for to increase to approximately billion  an increase of approximately from the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes is expected to contribute approximately one quarter of this improvement  however recent currency exchange rate volatility makes this difficult to predict  and the inclusion of the port equipment business for the full fiscal year will account for approximately one third of this growth 
we expect to result in substantially break even operating earnings for the company  although the impact of net interest expense will likely result in a net loss for the year 
our restructuring activities should result in improved financial results for and beyond 
see note m restructuring and other charges in our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our restructuring activities  including the reasons  timing and costs associated with such activities 
after tax return on invested capital roic continues to be the unifying metric that we use to measure our operating performance 
roic measures how effectively we utilize the capital invested in our operations 
after tax roic is determined by dividing the sum of net operating profit after tax nopat as defined below for each of the previous four quarters by the average of the sum of total stockholders equity plus debt as defined below less cash and cash equivalents for the previous five quarters 
nopat  which is a non gaap measure  for each quarter is calculated by multiplying income loss from continuing and discontinued operations by a figure equal to one minus the effective tax rate of the company 
we believe that earnings from discontinued operations  as well as the net assets that comprise that operations invested capital  should be included in this calculation because it captures the financial returns on our capital allocation decisions for the measured periods 
for comparative purposes  roic for is presented as it was reported and not adjusted for the changes based on discontinued operations 
the effective tax rate is equal to the provision for benefit from income taxes divided by income loss before income taxes for the respective quarter 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion 
we calculate roic using the last four quarters nopat as this represents the most recent twelve month period at any given point of determination 
in order for the denominator of the roic ratio to properly match the operational period reflected in the numerator  we include the average of five quarters ending balance sheet amounts so that the denominator includes the average of the opening through ending balances on a quarterly basis over the same time period as the numerator four quarters of average invested capital 
we use roic as a unifying metric because we believe that it measures how effectively we invest our capital and provides a better measure to compare ourselves to peer companies to assist in assessing how we drive operational improvement 
we believe that roic measures return on the full enterprise wide amount of capital invested in our business  as opposed to another metric such as return on stockholders equity that only incorporates book equity  and is thus a more accurate and descriptive measure of our performance 
we also believe that adding debt less cash and cash equivalents to total stockholders equity provides a better comparison across similar businesses regarding total capitalization  and roic highlights the level of value creation as a percentage of capital invested 
consistent with this belief  we use roic in evaluating executive performance and compensation  as we have disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis in our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders 
in  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of million  which represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction segment and all of the goodwill originally in the utilities reporting unit  which is now part of the awp segment 
however  we do not believe that non cash impairment charges are indicative of returns on our invested capital 
therefore  we have excluded the effect of these impairment charges from the metrics used in our calculation of roic 
as the tables below show  our roic at december  was negative  down from positive at december   mainly due to the operating losses and cash flow from operations in the recent periods

lower net sales volume  particularly for tower cranes and rough terrain cranes  decreased net sales by approximately  million  as global commercial construction projects continued to slow and oil related energy demand for rough terrain cranes remained soft 
this decrease was partially offset by approximately million of increased sales volume of higher priced crawler and all terrain cranes 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in lower net sales volume decreased gross profit by approximately million 
this was partially offset by approximately million from improved sales of higher margin crawler and all terrain cranes

additionally  increased spending in developing markets administrative infrastructure and restructuring charges increased costs by approximately million 
interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million higher than the prior year 
this increase was primarily related to higher interest expense due to increased debt balances resulting from the capital markets activity in and acquisition related debt incurred in connection with the port equipment business purchase  as well as lower interest income due to lower interest rates 

table of contents other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was income of million  an increase of million when compared to expense of million in the prior year 
this was primarily due to currency translation gains in the current year period compared with losses in the prior year period

legal costs also increased in compared to these initiatives  coupled with infrastructure investments to handle growth in developing markets  contributed approximately million of costs incurred in the current year 
these charges were more than offset by an increase of approximately million in corporate costs allocated to the business segments in versus the prior year 
interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million higher than the prior year 
this increase was primarily related to the full year effect of an increase of million in our debt less cash and cash equivalents balance from december   resulting from million of senior subordinated notes issued in november  which increased interest expense and was partially offset by increased interest income from higher average cash balances 
this increase in our cash balance was lowered by the acquisition of asv and a share repurchase program 
other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was expense of million  a decrease of million when compared to income of million in the prior year 
this was primarily due to approximately million of foreign currency translation losses in the current year compared to gains of approximately million in the prior year 
these losses and gains were due to foreign denominated balances that were revalued in the functional currencies of the entities that hold them as foreign exchange rates changed 
additionally  gains on the sale of assets were approximately million lower in than in income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of negative  as compared to income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the effective tax rate for was higher than in the prior year  primarily due to the non deductibility of goodwill impairment charges 
the effect of reduced statutory rates in certain european countries and discrete items partially offset the tax impact of the goodwill impairment charges 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in  resulting primarily from higher net sales volume 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out fifo method and the average cost method approximately and  respectively 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
at december   reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
accounts receivable we are required to judge our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical accounts receivable collection experience will be indicative of future results 
guarantees we have issued guarantees to financial institutions of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks  and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of the cranes segment  and genie holdings  inc and its affiliates genie  part of the aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by genie of million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  guarantees asc 
we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we could expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  
table of contents given current economic conditions  there can be no assurances that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 

table of contents we  from time to time  issue buyback guarantees in conjunction with certain sales agreements 
these primarily relate to trade value agreements tvas in which a customer may trade in equipment in the future at a stated price credit if the customer meets certain conditions 
the trade in price credit is determined at the time of the original sale of equipment 
in conjunction with the trade in  these conditions include a requirement to purchase new equipment at fair market value at the time of trade in  which fair value is required to be of equal or greater value than the original equipment cost 
other conditions also include the general functionality and state of repair of the machine 
we have concluded that any credit provided to customers under a tva buyback guarantee  which is expected to be equal to or less than the fair value of the equipment returned on the trade in date  is a guarantee to be accounted for in accordance with asc the original sale of equipment  accompanied by a buyback guarantee  is a multiple element transaction wherein we offer our customer the right  after some period of time  for a limited period of time  to exchange purchased equipment for a fixed price trade in credit toward another of our products 
the fixed price trade in credit is accounted for under the guidance provided by asc pursuant to this right  we have agreed to make a payment in the form of a trade in credit to the customer contingent upon the customer exercising its right to trade in the original purchased equipment 
under the guidance of asc  we record the fixed price trade in credit at its fair value 
accordingly  as noted above  we have accounted for the trade in credit as a separate deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
we do not amortize goodwill  in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other 
we selected october as the date for our required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by our management 
our four operating segments comprise the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use an income approach derived from the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units is compared to our market capitalization on the valuation date to assess its reasonableness 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the discounted cash flow model also includes a determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
there were no indicators of goodwill impairment in the tests performed as of october  and as a result of our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  our construction and awp segments recorded non cash charges of million and million  respectively  to reflect impairment of goodwill in these reporting units  which represented all of the goodwill recorded in the construction segment and all of the goodwill originally in the utilities reporting unit  which is now part of the awp segment  see note j goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value for the reporting units as of october  
table of contents impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
we did not have any impairment for the years ended december  and however  we recognized fixed asset impairments of million for the year ended december   of which million was recognized as part of restructuring costs 
see note m restructuring and other charges 
accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances and our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our product safety team 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
defined benefit plans pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained one qualified defined benefit pension plan and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
the benefits covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation in the qualified plan is frozen and participants are only credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plan based on the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program  excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
participation in the nonqualified plan was frozen effective december   however  eligible participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and the amount of benefits 
we maintain defined benefit plans in germany  france  china  india and the united kingdom for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in germany  france  india and china are unfunded plans 
for our operations in italy  indonesia  malaysia and the united arab emirates  there are mandatory termination indemnity plans providing a benefit that is payable upon termination of employment in substantially all cases of termination 
we record this obligation based on the mandated requirements 
the measure of the current obligation is not dependent on the employees future service and therefore is measured at current value 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the uk funded plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and are in real estate investment securities 
these allocations are reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plans 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions  including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed percent of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the assumptions used in the actuarial models are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 

table of contents expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plan and for the us plans at december  our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to for international plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our international pension plans were to at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as a reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily decreases in the discount rate  resulted in a net increase in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plans estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liabilities and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce the cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
the assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation foreign plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of the company 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to divergent treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 

table of contents we evaluate deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type capital gain vs 
ordinary income as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because net operating losses nols in certain jurisdictions expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future earnings would be sufficient to use most of our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of our international subsidiaries where such earnings are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
if earnings of foreign subsidiaries are not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us income taxes  foreign income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes have been provided 
we do not provide deferred income taxes on the temporary difference between the book and tax basis in domestic subsidiaries where permissible 
at this time  determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the investment in subsidiaries is not practical 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take 
our practice is to file income tax returns that conform to the requirements of each jurisdiction and to record provisions for tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  in accordance with asc  income taxes 
as our business has grown in geographic scope  size and complexity  so has our potential exposure to uncertain tax positions 
given the subjective nature of applicable tax law  the results of an audit of any tax return could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fair value measurement guidance  which was later codified under asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
it defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
this guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the guidance indicates  among other things  that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
this guidance defines fair value based upon an exit price model 
in february  the fasb issued further guidance to exclude accounting for leases from fair value measurement and to delay the effective date of fair value measurement for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until the beginning of the first quarter of effective january   fair value measurement was applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities 
the adoption of fair value measurements did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of business combinations guidance  which was later codified under asc  business combinations 
the revised guidance retains the underlying concepts that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but changes the application of the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
in april  the fasb issued further guidance  which clarifies the initial and subsequent recognition  subsequent accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period 
if the acquisition date fair value of an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized based on guidance in asc  contingencies  which provides thresholds for recognition based on probability and the ability to reasonably estimate an amount or range of amounts 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   which  for us  was january  as discussed in note i acquisitions  the adoption of this guidance affected the reporting of our acquisition of the port equipment business 
in december  the fasb issued guidance related to noncontrolling interests later codified under asc  consolidation 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   which  for us  was january  this guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
it also amends certain consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of the revised business combination guidance discussed above 
this guidance also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
adoption of the noncontrolling interest guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued guidance related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities later codified under asc  derivatives and hedging 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november   which  for us  was january  this guidance is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring transparency about the nature  purpose  location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity s financial statements  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows

in april  the fasb issued guidance related to determining the useful lives of intangible assets later codified under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis to all intangible assets acquired and for disclosures on all intangible assets recognized on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   which  for us  was january  adoption of the new guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in may  the fasb issued guidance related to accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  which was later codified under asc  debt 
this guidance requires separate accounting for the liability and equity components of convertible debt securities that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlement including partial cash settlement in a manner that reflects the company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at time of issuance when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
this bifurcation results in a component of the convertible debt to be classified in equity and accretion of the resulting discount on the debt as part of interest expense reflected in the income statement 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which  for us  was january  as disclosed in note n long term obligations  adoption of this guidance affected the reporting of the convertible senior subordinated notes due convertible notes issued in june in november  the fasb ratified guidance related to equity method investment accounting  which was later codified under asc  investments equity method and joint ventures 
this guidance applies to all investments accounted for under the equity method 
it states that an entity shall measure its equity investment initially at cost 
contingent consideration should only be included in the initial measurement of the equity method investment if it is required to be recognized by specific authoritative guidance other than that contained in business combinations guidance  asc however  if any equity method investment agreement involves a contingent consideration arrangement in which the fair value of the investor s share of the investee s net assets exceeds the investor s initial cost  a liability should be recognized 
an equity method investor is required to recognize other than temporary impairments of an equity method investment and shall account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment 
any gain or loss to the investor resulting from an investee s share issuance shall be recognized in earnings 
this guidance shall be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   which  for us  was january   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and shall be applied prospectively 
adoption of this equity method investment accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued guidance revising employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets which was later codified under asc  compensation retirement benefits 
this guidance revised employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
this guidance requires additional disclosure of a benefit plan s investment allocation decision making process  the fair value of each major category of plan assets  the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the plan assets  and any significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december   with early application permitted 
adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in april  the fasb issued guidance related to interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments later codified under asc  financial instruments 
this guidance enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures 
it relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on a company s balance sheet at fair value 
prior to the effective date  fair values for these assets and liabilities have only been disclosed once a year 
this guidance will now require these disclosures on a quarterly basis  providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early application permitted for periods ending after march  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued guidance related to subsequent events  which was later codified under asc  subsequent events

it also requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all readers of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented

in june  the fasb issued guidance to establish the fasb accounting standards codification codification 
the codification is the single source of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles for sec registrants 
all existing accounting standards are superseded as described in the guidance 
all other accounting literature not included in the codification is nonauthoritative 
this statement is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued guidance related to the transfers of financial assets  which has been codified under asc  transfers and servicing 
this guidance requires entities to provide more information about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  with transferred financial assets 
it also requires additional disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
it also eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and changes the requirements for de recognition of financial assets 
this guidance is effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning on and after january  earlier application was prohibited 
we are evaluating the adoption of this guidance but do not expect that it will have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued guidance amending the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities  which has been codified under asc  consolidations 
it replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative and requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
it also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
this guidance is effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning on and after january  earlier application was prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on the determination and reporting of our financial results 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended asc  revenue recognition 
this guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how to allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items have value on a stand alone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
arrangement consideration shall be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price  except under certain circumstances such as items recorded at fair value and items not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
this guidance eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining allocation of arrangement consideration and allows the use of an entity s best estimate to determine the selling price if vsoe and third party evidence cannot be determined 
it also requires additional disclosures such as the nature of the arrangement  certain provisions within the arrangement  significant factors used to determine selling prices and the timing of revenue recognition related to the arrangement 
this guidance shall be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on the determination and reporting of our financial results

this amendment requires new disclosures  including the reasons for and amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of activity for level fair value measurements 
it also clarified guidance related to determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities and the information to be provided for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this guidance will be effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the adoption of this guidance  but we do not expect that it will have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in addition  we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities at december  we believe that cash generated from operations  together with access to our bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements 
we have no significant debt maturities until  however  we will continue our focus on internal cash flow generation 
with the actions we have taken to reduce costs  delay certain capital spending projects and increase cash generated from operations  along with our strengthened balance sheet and billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our mining business  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to execute our key business plans 
during the second half of  we experienced relatively stable order patterns  although at lower levels than in recent years 
we are intensely focused in each of our businesses on managing our sales  inventory and operations planning process to adjust our production rate and material ordering in line with current and anticipated market conditions 
our businesses are working closely with suppliers to minimize raw material deliveries and with customers and dealers to confirm existing orders to minimize the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
during  many of our businesses operated at production levels below then current demand as we focused on reducing inventory 
as a result of this focus  we reduced inventories in continuing operations by approximately million in  exceeding our million goal for the year  which included assumptions of significant inventory reductions in what are now discontinued operations 
consequently  our businesses are beginning now to produce at levels approximating end user demand 
the outlook for demand in our businesses is still uncertain  however  we have begun to work with our suppliers to ensure we have adequate raw material when demand strengthens 
we are also considering stimulating demand by initiating inventory stocking programs and end customer financing through terex financial services when we believe the investments are justified 
these actions may result in increases in working capital as we position our businesses for the anticipated market recovery 
we are continuing our long standing program to increase inventory turns by sharing  throughout our company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the level of inventory needed to support our business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 

table of contents our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following many of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of our equipment 
changes either in the customers credit profile or in used equipment values may impact the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
given current economic conditions and the lack of liquidity in the global credit markets  there can be no assurance that third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers as they have in the past 
as our sales levels change  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may change 
our suppliers extend payment terms to us based on our overall credit rating 
declines in our credit rating may impact suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition and the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and other factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  our customers have delayed purchasing decisions  which has had a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
as a result of the ongoing recession  many of our customers have delayed or cancelled orders 
we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these products 
historically  we have supplemented our liquidity by insuring and selling a portion of our accounts receivable to third party financial institutions 
because of our sufficient liquidity position  we reduced the use of these programs during and and suspended them during the fourth quarter of to help fund our cash expenditures  we have maintained cash balances and a revolving line of credit in addition to term borrowings from our bank group 
our bank credit facilities provide us with a revolving line of credit of up to million that is available through july  and term debt of million that will mature on july  the revolving line of credit consists of million of available domestic revolving loans and million of available multicurrency revolving loans 
the credit facilities also originally provided for incremental loan commitments of up to million  which may be extended at the option of the lenders  in the form of revolving credit loans  term loans or a combination of both 
on july   we acquired the port equipment business for approximately million 
for more information regarding this acquisition  see note i acquisitions in our consolidated financial statements 
existing financial creditors of the port equipment business agreed to provide us with long term financing on favorable terms for substantially all of the acquisition price 
to accomplish this  we entered into two incremental term loan assumption agreements in july under our existing credit facility pursuant to which we borrowed million of the million available to us for incremental loan commitments  leaving million available for further incremental loans 
see note n long term obligations in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on these two incremental term loans 
the acquisition of the port equipment business increased the balance of our debt  less cash and cash equivalents by approximately million 
although we believe that the banks participating in our credit facility have adequate capital and resources  we can provide no assurance that each of these banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future 
if any banks in our lending group were to fail  it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our credit facility would be reduced 
if the availability under our credit facility were reduced significantly  we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to finance our capital needs but there can be no assurance that such financing would be available at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the interest rates charged under our bank credit facility are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  the weighted average interest rate on the term loans under our bank credit facility was and at december  and december   respectively 
in june  we issued and sold million shares of our common stock to the public for net proceeds to the company of million 
also in june  we issued million of senior notes the senior notes and million of convertible senior subordinated notes the convertible notes 
we used a portion of the proceeds from these equity and debt offerings to prepay some of our term loans under our bank credit facility and to pay off the entire outstanding balance under the revolving credit component of our bank facility 
see note n long term obligations in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on these notes 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives when appropriate 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix while reducing interest rate risk 

table of contents we have no scheduled significant debt maturities until the revolving line of credit under our bank facility expires in july and the term debt under our bank credit facility matures in july our senior subordinated notes mature in january  our convertible notes mature in june  our senior notes mature in june and our senior subordinated notes mature in november on december   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our mining business to bucyrus for billion 
we had the right under the agreement to request that million of the purchase price be paid in the form of shares of bucyrus common stock in lieu of cash at a price per share of  which represented the average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of bucyrus common stock for a period of consecutive trading days prior to december  we amended our bank credit facility to allow us to acquire these shares of bucyrus common stock and to enter into hedging agreements to manage the risk related to our investment in the stock 
upon the closing of the mining business sale on february   we entered into a stockholders agreement with bucyrus with respect to our rights as a bucyrus stockholder 
among other things  the stockholder agreement provides that we will not directly or indirectly sell or otherwise transfer our economic interest in the shares of bucyrus stock we receive for a period of one year 
bucyrus has agreed to provide us with registration rights  including demand registration and shelf registration rights  to facilitate our sale of the shares of bucyrus stock after the one year holding period 
accordingly  because of the sale of the mining business  we received from bucyrus cash proceeds of approximately billion and  shares of bucyrus common stock 
we will have significant financial exposure to the price of bucyrus stock until we sell the shares 
when we elected to receive the bucyrus shares as part of the sale consideration  we did so because we believed the synergies resulting from the combination of the existing bucyrus business and our mining business will increase the value of the bucyrus shares  however  there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
we have analyzed a number of alternatives to hedge our financial exposure in the bucyrus shares in compliance with our stockholders agreement 
accordingly  in we have entered into a series of derivatives contracts to hedge a portion of the risk using a basket of stocks in companies in similar industries to bucyrus  and may increase or decrease these hedges over time 
these stocks have historically been highly correlated to the bucyrus stock price 
if the correlations remain at their historic levels  we believe these derivatives will hedge a portion of our economic risk to bucyrus stock 
however  there can be no assurances that these correlations will continue during the term of the derivative contracts and  as a result  these derivatives may not hedge our entire economic risk 
the sale of our mining business constitutes an asset sale under various agreements governing our debt 
we either must reinvest the net cash proceeds we receive the billion in cash  less certain costs and expenses in our business within days of the consummation of the sale of the mining business pursuant to our bank credit agreement or within to days after the consummation of the sale of the mining business pursuant to the indentures for our outstanding notes or use the proceeds to repay indebtedness 
the priority of debt repayments is prescribed by the terms of our various debt agreements 
term loans under our bank credit facility would be repaid first  then any remaining net cash proceeds would be used to pay our outstanding notes in the order provided in the note indentures 
the shares of bucyrus common stock we received are not considered net cash proceeds and will not be subject to reinvestment or debt repayment obligations unless and until such time as we sell those shares 
reinvesting the net cash proceeds received from an asset sale in our business is broadly defined in our debt agreements and would include capital expenditures  increases in working capital or acquisitions 
we have announced our intention to reinvest the proceeds of the sale of our mining business to help grow and diversify terex through capital expenditures in emerging markets  working capital to stimulate growth and acquisitions of machinery  and industrial products companies  for example 
we are  however  subject to certain restrictions under our debt agreements in our uses of cash  including limitations in making acquisitions 
we have restrictions in our debt agreements about the financial instruments we can use to invest our cash 
we have invested our cash typically in a combination of highly rated  highly liquid money market funds and in short term bank deposits with large  highly rated banks 
our investment objective is to preserve capital and liquidity while earning a market rate of interest 
following the sale of the mining business  we have cash balances of over billion  including amounts that will be payable for income taxes in connection with the cash and stock proceeds of the mining business sale 
prior to june   our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our outstanding common shares 
we made no purchases under this program after september  and the program expired on june  in total  we repurchased million shares for approximately million under this program 

table of contents our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us  and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the sec 
in addition  the terms of our bank credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
our ability to access the capital markets is also limited as a result of the settlement of our previously disclosed sec investigation of terex 
as a result of the settlement and final court decree  for a period of three years  or such earlier time as we are able to obtain a waiver from the sec  i we are no longer qualified as a well known seasoned issuer as defined in rule of the securities act of  and cannot take advantage of the benefits available to a wksi  which include expedited registration and access to the capital markets  ii we cannot rely on the safe harbor provisions regarding forward looking statements provided by the regulations issued under the securities exchange act of  and iii we cannot utilize regulation a or d 
taken together  these rules limit our ability to access the capital markets and utilize certain provisions available generally to other us public companies 
cash flows vs 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily driven by losses incurred during the year 
however  cash provided from working capital in the current year totaled million compared to cash used in working capital of million in the prior year 
additionally  in  we have used cash from operations to settle income tax liabilities that were accrued in previous years 
currently  our losses from operations are generating non cash income tax benefits in the form of increased deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets will produce future cash flow benefits as we generate taxable income 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million or million less than cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions in and lower capital expenditures in the current year 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of million  primarily due to proceeds from the capital market issuances of debt and common stock in june and net proceeds from incremental term loan borrowings under our credit facility in connection with the acquisition of terex port equipment compared to cash used for share repurchases in contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  total payments due by period committed year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments total purchase commitments include non cancellable and cancellable commitments 
in many cases  cancellable commitments contain penalty provisions for cancellation 
long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
with respect to our tax audits worldwide  it is reasonably possible that we will make payments in of up to million 
payments may be made in part to mitigate the accrual of interest in connection with income tax audit assessments that may be issued and that we would contest  or may in part be made to settle the matter with the tax authorities 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in credit guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 

table of contents we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the retirement plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions and payments to the retirement plans of million  and we estimate that our retirement plan contributions will be approximately million in off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  may fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total credit guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our aerial work platforms segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
given current financial and economic conditions  there can be no assurance that historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigation and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and retirement plans and other in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
sale leaseback transactions our rental business typically rents equipment to customers for periods of no less than three months 
to better match cash outflows in the rental business to cash inflows from customers  we finance the equipment through a series of sale leasebacks  which are classified as operating leases 
the leaseback period is typically months in duration 
at december   the historical cost of equipment being leased back from the financing companies was approximately million and the minimum lease payment in will be approximately million 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies  interest rate and bucyrus stock risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows or forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 

table of contents we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
we have market risk with respect to the shares of bucyrus common stock we received in connection with the sale of our mining business to bucyrus 
bucyrus stock is traded on nasdaq and is subject to substantial price fluctuation and volatility 
we have entered into a series of derivatives contracts to hedge a portion of the risk using a basket of stocks in companies in similar industries to bucyrus 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and bucyrus stock prices may have on our financial performance 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and are amortizing it through the debt maturity date 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations  guarantees  class action lawsuits and the matters described above in item legal proceedings 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on us 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances should any of such events occur 
no such incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has required  and will continue to require  us to make expenditures 
we do not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
see note k derivative financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar versus functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows  identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to protect anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of approximately million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net loss of million at december  
table of contents at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on the effect that aggregate changes in the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes would have on our operating income 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies outside the us by to amounts already incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended december  would have decreased the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes already included in our reported operating income by approximately million in interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate and libor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness through the use of interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and are amortizing it through the debt maturity date 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pre tax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million in bucyrus shares risk pursuant to the sale of our mining business to bucyrus  we acquired  shares of bucyrus stock in lieu of million of the cash purchase price 
this represents a per share price of bucyrus stock of  which represented the average of the daily volume weighted average price per share of bucyrus stock for a period of consecutive trading days prior to december   the date of the mining business sale agreement 
upon closing  we entered into a stockholders agreement with bucyrus with respect to our rights as a bucyrus stockholder 
among other things  the stockholders agreement provides that we will not directly or indirectly sell or otherwise transfer our economic interest in the shares of bucyrus stock we received for a period of one year 
bucyrus has agreed to provide us with registration rights  including demand registration and shelf registration rights  to facilitate our sale of the shares of bucyrus stock after the one year holding period 
we will have significant financial exposure to the price of bucyrus stock until we sell the shares  as we will own more than of the total outstanding number of shares of bucyrus common stock 
bucyrus stock is traded on nasdaq and is subject to substantial price fluctuation and volatility 
our obligation to hold these shares for a one year period leaves us exposed to these price movements 
we have analyzed a number of alternatives to hedge our financial exposure in the bucyrus shares in compliance with our stockholders agreement 
accordingly  in we have entered into a series of derivatives contracts to hedge a portion of the risk using a basket of stocks in companies in similar industries to bucyrus  and may increase or decrease these hedges over time 
these stocks have historically been highly correlated to the bucyrus stock price 
if the correlations remain at their historic levels  we believe these derivatives will hedge a portion of our economic risk to bucyrus stock 
however  there can be no assurances that these correlations will continue during the term of the derivative contracts and  as a result  these derivatives may not hedge our entire economic risk 
commodities risk principal materials and components that we use in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulics  cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
extreme movements in the cost and availability of these materials and components may affect our performance 
worldwide steel prices rose for most of in response to higher demand caused by continued higher consumption in developing market countries such as china 
due to the continued high demand for steel in  many suppliers of steel  castings and other products increased prices or added surcharges to the price of their products 
the abrupt decline in world markets in led to a significant slowing of inventory in our supply chain 
the supply and demand dynamics are moving closer to historical equilibrium as we enter most of our steel costs are back to levels and other component costs are decreasing as well 
in  we experienced some benefit from lower input costs as raw material receipts increased as our existing raw material inventory was utilized 

table of contents in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a sole supplier although alternative suppliers of such materials are generally available 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
the inability of suppliers  especially any sole suppliers for a particular business  to deliver materials and components promptly could result in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
as a result of the macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the us and other parts of the world  our suppliers may experience serious cash flow problems and  as a result  could seek to significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output 
we have designed and implemented plans to mitigate the impact of these risks by using alternate suppliers  expanding our supply base to include asian suppliers which use steel from markets where prices are more stable  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and developing a closer working relationship with key suppliers 
we continue to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis  including by improving the globalization of our supply base and using suppliers in china and india 
one key terex business system initiative has been developing and implementing world class capability in supply chain management  logistics and global purchasing 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
