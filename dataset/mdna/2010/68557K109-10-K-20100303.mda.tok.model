other businesses private label and hosting businesses we license our technology and business services to third parties and offer them access to our travel content through our private label business 
using our technology platform  these partners are able to operate websites under their own brands 
our private label business helps provide the travel products that are available on a wide range of third party websites  including a number of airline and hotel websites 
we earn revenue from our private label business through revenue sharing arrangements for the travel booked on these third party websites 
we also host and manage websites on behalf of third parties through our hosting products 
as of december   we managed portions of american airlines and northwest airlines websites 
we earn revenue from our hosting business through license or fee arrangements 
partner marketing through our partner marketing programs  we generate advertising revenue by providing our partners access to our customer base through a combination of display advertising  performance based advertising and other marketing programs 
travel companies  convention and visitor bureaus  credit card partners  media  packaged goods and other non travel advertisers all advertise on our websites 
merchant and retail models merchant model our merchant model provides customers the ability to book air  hotel  car  destination services reservations and dynamic vacation packages 
hotel transactions comprise the majority of our merchant bookings 
we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that product 
we may  depending upon the brand and the travel product  also charge our customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation on our websites 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is higher under the merchant model compared with the retail model due to our negotiation of net rates with suppliers 
customers generally pay us for reservations at the time of booking  which is in advance of their travel 
we pay our suppliers at a later date  which generally ranges from one to sixty days after the customer uses the reservation 
initially  we record these customer receipts as accrued merchant payables and either deferred income or net revenue  depending on the travel product 
the timing difference between the cash collected from our customers and payments to our suppliers improves our operating cash flows and represents a source of liquidity for us 
we recognize net revenue under the merchant model when we have no further obligations to the customer 
for merchant air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for merchant hotel transactions and merchant car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively 
the timing of revenue recognition is different for merchant air travel because our primary service to the customer is fulfilled at the time of booking 
in this model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  however we are subject to fraud risk  we have the ability to determine the price  we are not responsible for the actual delivery of the flight  hotel room or car rental  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
when customers assemble dynamic vacation packages  we may offer the customer the ability to book a combination of travel products that use both the merchant model and the retail model 
dynamic vacation packages allow us to make products available to our customers at prices that are generally lower than booking 
table of contents each travel product separately 
our net revenue per transaction is generally higher for dynamic vacation packages than for travel products booked separately 
retail model our retail model provides customers the ability to book air  hotel  cruise and car rental reservations 
air transactions comprise the majority of our retail bookings 
under our retail model  we earn commissions from suppliers for airline tickets  hotel stays  car rentals and other travel products and services booked on our websites 
we generally receive these commissions from suppliers after the customer uses the travel reservation 
we may  depending upon the brand and the travel product  also charge our customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation on our websites 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is lower under the retail model compared with the merchant model 
however  air reservations booked under the retail model contribute substantially to our overall gross bookings and net revenue due to the high volume of air reservations booked on our websites 
we recognize net revenue under the retail model when the reservation is made  secured by a customer with a credit card and we have no further obligations to the customer 
for air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for hotel transactions and car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively  net of an allowance for cancelled reservations 
in the retail model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  we are not the primary obligor with the customer  we have no latitude in determining pricing  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
supplier relationships and global distribution systems supplier relationships we have teams that manage relationships and negotiate agreements with our suppliers 
these agreements generally cover access to the supplier s travel inventory as well as payment for our services 
our teams cover air  hotel  car rental  cruise  travel insurance and destination services suppliers 
our teams focus on managing relationships  obtaining supplier sponsored promotions and negotiating contracts 
the global hotel services team is responsible for negotiating agreements that provide us access to the inventory of independent hotels  chains and hotel management companies 
as part of our efforts to drive global hotel transaction growth  we have increased the number of hotel market managers on our global hotel services team  particularly in asia pacific and europe 
with this additional staff in place  we have signed a substantial number of new direct hotel contracts  which provide us with higher margins  better hotel content and increased promotional opportunities 
global distribution systems global distribution systems gdss provide us access to a comprehensive set of supplier content through a single source 
suppliers  such as airlines and hotels  utilize gdss to connect their product and service offerings with travel providers  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
certain of our businesses utilize gds services provided by galileo  worldspan and amadeus it group amadeus 
under our gds service agreements  we receive revenue in the form of an incentive payment for air  car and hotel segments that are processed through a gds 
galileo and worldspan are subsidiaries of travelport  and we have an agreement with travelport that covers the gds services provided by both galileo and worldspan 
this agreement contains volume requirements for the number of segments that we must process through galileo and worldspan and requires us to make shortfall payments if we do not process the required minimum number of segments for a given year 
as a result  a significant portion of our gds services are provided by travelport gdss 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of incentive revenue for segments processed through galileo and worldspan  which accounted for more than of our total net revenue 

table of contents operations and technology systems infrastructure and web and database servers we use savvis co location services in the us to host our systems infrastructure and web and database servers for orbitz  cheaptickets  the away network  orbitz for business and ebookers 
the majority of our hardware and other equipment is located at the savvis facility 
savvis provides data center management services as well as emergency hands on support

information about segments and geographic areas we operate and manage our business as a single operating segment

industry conditions general the worldwide travel industry is a large and dynamic industry that has been characterized by rapid and significant change 
the global economy experienced a prolonged recession during and that significantly impacted the overall travel industry 
the weakening economy caused unemployment rates to rise and lowered consumer confidence which  in turn  has resulted in changes to consumer spending patterns  including reduced spending on discretionary items  such as travel 
while the overall travel market declined in due to the weakened economy  the decline in the online travel market has not been as sharp 
in an effort to drive demand to their websites  online travel companies otcs significantly improved their value propositions for customers during by eliminating or reducing booking and certain other fees  which enabled otcs to better compete with suppliers for market share 
we compete in various geographic markets  with our primary markets being the united states  europe and asia pacific 
within the united states  the most mature of the global travel markets  the growth rate of online travel bookings has slowed due to both the maturity of the market and the weak economy 
according to phocuswright  an independent travel  tourism and hospitality research firm  the online travel booking penetration rate in the united states reached in we are one of the market leaders within the united states due to our strength in the air business  which we are leveraging to gain market share in the global hotel marketplace 
internationally  the european and asia pacific markets are characterized by their high level of fragmentation  particularly in the hotel industry 
both the european and asia pacific markets continue to benefit from increases in internet usage rates and growing acceptance of online booking  which has partially offset the negative effects of the weak economy 
in europe  we have historically lacked scale relative to our competitors 
in  we completed the migration of all of our ebookers websites onto our new technology platform  which we believe will help us increase our scale and improve our competitive position in europe over time 
growth in the asia pacific market is one of our primary focuses for  as it represents a region with significant growth opportunity where our competition is not as entrenched 
according to phocuswright  the online travel booking penetration rates for europe and asia pacific were and  respectively for 
table of contents competition the general market for travel products and services is intensely competitive 
the online travel industry generally has low barriers of entry and competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost 
our current competitors include online travel companies  traditional offline travel companies  suppliers  travel research companies  search engines and meta search companies 
in addition  we compete internationally with smaller regional operators 
the companies that we compete with include the following among online travel companies  our major competitors primarily include expedia 
com  hotels 
com  hotwire 
com and venere 
com  which are owned by expedia  inc  travelocity 
com and lastminute 
com  which are owned by sabre holdings corporation  priceline

com  which is owned by rakuten  inc  and wotif 
com and asiawebdirect 
com  which are owned by wotif 
com holdings limited 
in the offline travel company category  our largest competitors include companies such as liberty travel  inc  american express travel related services company  inc  thomas cook group plc and tui travel plc 
we compete with suppliers  such as airlines  hotel and rental car companies  many of which have their own branded websites and toll free numbers through which they generate business 
we compete with travel research companies such as tripadvisor llc and travelzoo inc  through which consumers can access content such as user generated travel reviews 
travel research companies also send customers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 
we compete with search engines including google  bing  yahoo and aol and meta search companies such as kayak 
search and meta search websites are capable of sending customers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 
suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites in lieu of using third parties 
suppliers who sell on their own websites offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points  which may make their offerings more attractive than our offerings to some consumers 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to customers  ease of use  accessibility  reliability and innovation 
seasonality our businesses experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
the majority of our customers book leisure travel rather than business travel 
gross bookings for leisure travel are generally highest in the first half of the year as customers plan and book their spring and summer vacations 
however  net revenue generated under the merchant model is generally recognized when the travel takes place and typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first half of the year and our net revenue is typically highest in the second and third calendar quarters 
our seasonality may also be affected by fluctuations in the travel products our suppliers make available to us for booking  the growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix 

table of contents company strategy our strategic focus for is on driving global hotel transaction growth  supporting our mission to become one of the three primary hotel platforms globally 
specifically  we think of our activities as they relate to hotels as falling into three areas demand  supply and retailing 
demand we are focused on generating demand through both business to consumer and business to business channels 
in  we intend to further increase brand awareness and loyalty such that consumers come directly to our websites to book their travel 
we are also focused on continuing to optimize our search engine marketing spending to drive consumers to our websites in a cost effective manner 
we are actively pursuing strategies to increase the amount of traffic coming to our websites through seo  crm  our private label business and our corporate travel business  orbitz for business 
supply we are focused on working with our suppliers to provide customers the ability to book a broad range of highly competitive travel products and services on our websites 
we are investing in enhanced hotel connectivity and infrastructure solutions in we also intend to expand our supply footprint in markets where online penetration is low 
retailing we are focused on ways to improve our ability to convert website visitors into customers 
we plan to enhance the customer shopping experience on our websites by developing new tools and technologies to help users research options  improving the quality of the hotel content we make available such as editorial descriptions  photographs and user generated reviews and through the development of systems and technology that will allow us to use historical data to provide customers with more relevant search results 
we also intend to build upon our existing telesales capabilities to drive volume for higher margin travel products 
employees as of february   we had approximately  full time employees  more than half of whom were based in the us and the remaining were based primarily in australia and the uk we believe we have a good relationship with our employees

risk factors 
our results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be substantially and adversely impacted by the economic downturn and our level of indebtedness increases our sensitivity to this risk 
while we have seen recent improvement in consumer spending  the global economy continues to suffer following the deterioration in the capital markets and related financial crisis in the second half of both our customers and suppliers have felt the impact of this downturn 
several us airlines have implemented capacity reductions in the face of slowing customer demand and are under increased pressure to reduce their overall distribution costs 
the weakness in the economy has also negatively impacted consumer spending patterns  including spending on travel 
if consumer demand for travel and the products offered on our websites continues to decrease  our revenue may decline further 
if economic conditions do not continue to improve  or worsen  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  a substantial or prolonged material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition could affect our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in our senior secured credit agreement  which could result in our having to seek amendments or waivers from our lenders to avoid the termination of commitments and or the acceleration of the maturity of amounts that are outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
the cost of our obtaining an amendment or waiver could be significant  and could substantially increase our cost of borrowing over the remaining term of our senior secured credit agreement 
further  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain an amendment or waiver 
if our lenders were unwilling to enter into an amendment or provide a waiver  all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
our liquidity has been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted 
the weak and volatile conditions in the global financial markets and financial sector caused a substantial deterioration in the capital markets in late and early we experienced the negative effects of this instability when lehman commercial paper inc lcpi filed for bankruptcy in october lcpi held a million commitment under our revolving credit facility  and its bankruptcy effectively reduced the total availability under our revolving credit facility from million to million 
in the last half of  the capital markets improved and in january  par investment partners  lp par exchanged million aggregate principal amount of term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement for  shares of our common stock  and travelport concurrently purchased  shares of our common stock for million in cash  which has improved our overall liquidity 
nevertheless  in the future  we may require more liquidity than is available to us under our revolving credit facility as a result of changes in our business model  changes to payment terms or other supplier or regulatory agency imposed requirements  lower than anticipated operating cash flows or other unanticipated events  such as unfavorable outcomes in our legal proceedings 
the liquidity provided by cash flows from our merchant model bookings could be reduced if our suppliers  including credit card processors and hotels  changed their payment terms or imposed other requirements on us  or if our merchant model bookings declined as a result of current economic conditions or other factors 
if in the future  we require more liquidity than is available to us under our revolving credit facility  we cannot be certain that funding would be available to us or be available on attractive or acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of potential business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the financial condition of one or more of our major suppliers  including airlines and car rental companies  deteriorates or restructures its operations 
in the past several years  several major airlines have filed for bankruptcy protection  recently exited bankruptcy or discussed publicly the risks of bankruptcy 
in addition  the economic downturn has severely impacted the automobile industry  including car rental companies 
we depend on a relatively small number of airlines for a significant portion of our net revenue 
our car net revenue is also generated from a relatively small number of car rental companies 
as a result of this dependence  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the financial condition of one or more of the major airlines or car rental companies were to deteriorate or in the event of supplier consolidation in either of these industries 
potential bankruptcies and consolidation in our suppliers industries could result in capacity reductions and increased prices  which may in turn have a negative impact on demand for travel products 
the travel industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to effectively compete in the future 
we operate in the highly competitive travel industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to compete effectively against numerous competitors  including other online travel companies  traditional offline travel companies  suppliers  travel research companies  search engines and meta search companies  several of which have significantly greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we have 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to customers  ease of use  accessibility  reliability and innovation 
if we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites  which typically do not charge customers a booking or service fee 
in addition  search and meta search sites have grown in popularity and may drive more traffic directly to the websites of suppliers or competitors 
in response  during  certain online travel companies  including us  reduced or eliminated booking fees on retail airline tickets and hotel stays and removed hotel change and cancellation fees 
although we were able to mitigate the resulting loss of revenue in by improving our operating and marketing efficiency  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to absorb the full impact of the elimination of fees in the future 
our results of operations could be negatively affected if competitive dynamics in the industry caused us to further reduce or eliminate the service fees we charge our customers 
if we are unable to implement further changes to our business in an effort to absorb the continuing impact of the reduction or elimination of these fees or are unable to increase revenue from other sources  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
our revenue is derived from the travel industry and a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volume  particularly air travel  as well as other industry trends  have and continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue is derived from the worldwide travel industry 
as a result  our revenue is directly related to the overall level of travel activity  particularly air travel volume  and is therefore significantly impacted by declines in or disruptions to travel in the us  europe and the asia pacific region due to factors entirely outside of our control 
these factors  which contributed in part to the decline in our net revenue in compared with  include general economic conditions  particularly the current economic downturn which has caused a decline in travel volume  global security issues  political instability  acts or threats of terrorism  hostilities or war and other political issues that could adversely affect travel volume in our key regions  epidemics or pandemics  natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  
table of contents the financial condition of suppliers  including the airline and hotel industry  and the impact of their financial condition on the cost and availability of air travel and hotel rooms  changes to regulations governing the airline and travel industry  fuel prices  work stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major airlines or airports  increased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel  travelers perceptions of the occurrence of travel related accidents or the scope  severity and timing of the other factors described above  and changes in occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels 
if there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes  particularly for air travel and hotel stays  for these or any other reasons  it would have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we carry significant goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets  and if a future impairment were to occur based on a decline in our stock price  projected results of operations  cash flows from operations or otherwise  we may be required to record a significant charge against earnings 
during the years ended december  and december   in response to changes in the economic environment and the prolonged decline in our market capitalization  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to our goodwill and million and million  respectively  related to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
as of december   after giving effect to these impairment charges  we had goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of million  which represented approximately of our total consolidated assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events occur and circumstances change indicating potential impairment 
factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired include a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization  lower than projected operating results and cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry 
due to the current economic uncertainty and other factors  we cannot predict whether our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be further impaired in future periods or whether a significant charge against our earnings may be required  which could be higher than the charges recorded during and if we are required to record an impairment charge for our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the future  this would adversely impact our results of operations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could limit the manner in which we operate our business 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  which was reduced to million as a result of the debt equity exchange we completed with par and the repayment of outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility in january our substantial level of indebtedness could result in the following it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  it reduces the funds available to us for purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures because we are required to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments  it puts us at a competitive disadvantage because we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors and reduces our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in the economy or our industry  including increased competition  and 
table of contents it may make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to not exceed a maximum total leverage ratio  which declines through march  if we fail to comply with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness 
if this were to occur  there is no assurance that alternative financing would be available to us or at favorable terms  particularly in the wake of the current economic environment 
in addition  restrictive covenants in our credit agreement specifically limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or enter into guarantees  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  make new investments  loans or acquisitions  grant or incur liens on our assets  sell our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  engage in transactions with affiliates  and make restricted payments 
as a result  we may operate our business differently than if we were not subject to these covenants and restrictions 
we rely on travelport to issue letters of credit on our behalf under its credit facility 
as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued by travelport on our behalf 
under the terms of the separation agreement  as amended  travelport has agreed to issue and renew letters of credit on our behalf through at least march  and thereafter so long as travelport and its affiliates as defined therein own at least of our voting stock 
travelport s obligation to issue letters of credit on our behalf is subject to certain further conditions  including a million limitation on the aggregate amount of letters of credit that travelport is required to issue on our behalf at any given point in time 
if we do not have a separate letter of credit facility in place if or when travelport is no longer obligated to issue letters of credit on our behalf  or if we exceed the million limitation or if we require letters of credit denominated in foreign currencies  we would be required to issue letters of credit under our revolving credit facility  which could significantly reduce our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had the equivalent of million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility  which were denominated in pounds sterling 
certain of our international subsidiaries have a history of significant operating losses  and our inability to improve their scale and profitability could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have historically incurred significant operating losses at our international subsidiaries and may continue to experience operating losses in the future  particularly since we expect to continue to incur high levels of marketing and other expenses in order to expand our international operations 
as a result  we have made  and may continue to make  significant investments in our international operations by using a portion of the cash flow generated from our domestic operations or making additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that our international subsidiaries will be profitable in the future or that any profits generated by them will be sufficient to recover our investments in them 

table of contents the profitability of our international subsidiaries depends to a large extent on the scale of their operations 
if we fail to achieve the desired scale  we may not be able to effectively compete in the global marketplace and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to additional risks not encountered when doing business in the us  including foreign exchange risk  and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 
with employees in approximately countries outside the us  we generated of our net revenue for the year ended december  from our international operations 
we are subject to certain risks as a result of having international operations and from having operations in multiple countries generally  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations due to distance  time zones  language and cultural differences  including issues associated with establishing management infrastructure in various countries  differences and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and exposure to local economic conditions  limits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and increased risk of piracy  preference of local populations for local providers  restrictions on the repatriation of non us investments and earnings back to the us  including withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions  diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to the extent we are not able to effectively mitigate or eliminate these risks  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international regulations  including  among others  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures to ensure that our employees and agents comply with the fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our ability to attract  train and retain executives and other qualified employees is critical to our results of operations and future growth 
we depend substantially on the continued services and performance of our key executives  senior management and skilled personnel  particularly our professionals with experience in our industry and our information technology and systems 
any of these individuals may chose to terminate their employment with us at any time 
the specialized skills we require can be difficult and time consuming to acquire and  as a result  these skills are often in short supply 
a significant period of time and expense may be required to hire and train replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart the company 
our inability to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by  for example  delaying our ability to bring new products and services to market or impairing the success of our operations or prospects for future growth 
we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness  and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 
we depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems  including technologies and systems utilized for reservations  communications  procurement and administrative systems 
certain of our businesses also utilize third party fare search solutions and gdss or other technologies 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to 
table of contents offer our customers enhanced products  services  features and functionality  while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving industry standards while continuing to improve the performance  features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings and the changing demands of the marketplace 
in particular  expanding our systems and infrastructure to meet any potential increases in business volume will require us to commit additional financial  operational and technical resources before those increases materialize  with no assurance that they actually will 
furthermore  our use of this technology could be challenged by claims that we have infringed upon the patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our existing systems  obtain new technologies and systems  or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost effective manner 
also  we may fail to achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system  or we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business could suffer 
we are dependent upon third party systems and service providers  and any disruption or adverse change in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently rely on certain third party computer systems  service providers and software companies  including the electronic central reservation systems and gdss of the airline  hotel and car rental industries 
in particular  our businesses rely on third parties to conduct searches for airfares  process hotel room transactions  process credit card payments  and provide computer infrastructure critical to our business 
in addition  we rely on a group of business process outsourcing companies located in various countries to provide us with call center and telesales services  back office administrative services such as ticketing fulfillment  hotel rate loading and quality control and information technology services  as well as financial services such as accounts payable processing and bank reconciliations 
any interruption in these third party services could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  we currently utilize gdss  including worldspan  galileo and amadeus  to process a significant portion of our bookings  and any interruption or deterioration in our gds partners products or services could prevent us from searching and booking airline and car rental reservations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with our technology partners 
in the event our arrangements with any of these third parties are impaired or terminated  we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms  which could result in significant additional costs or disruptions to our business 
in addition  some of our agreements with third party service providers can be terminated by those parties on short notice and  in many cases  provide no recourse for service interruptions 
a termination of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
system interruptions and the lack of redundancy may cause us to lose customers or business opportunities 
our inability to maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure may result in system interruptions 
system interruptions and slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  prolonged or frequent service outages  or insufficient capacity may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers  which could result in our losing customers and revenue or incurring liabilities 
in addition to the 
table of contents risks associated with inadequate maintenance or upgrading  our information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes  including natural disasters  war and acts of terrorism  power losses  computer systems failure  internet and telecommunications or data network failures  operator error  losses and corruption of data  and similar events  computer viruses  penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security  and the failure of third party systems or services that we rely upon to maintain our own operations 
we do not have backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations 
for example  if we were unable to connect to certain third party systems  such as gdss  due to failure of our systems  our ability to process bookings could be significantly or completely impaired 
many other systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient 
in addition  we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major interruption  and remediation may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
any extended interruption in our technologies or systems could significantly curtail our ability to conduct our businesses and generate revenue 
we depend on our supplier and partner relationships and adverse changes in these relationships or our inability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue 
we rely significantly on our relationships with airlines  hotels and other suppliers and travel partners 
adverse changes in any of these relationships  or the inability to enter into new relationships  could negatively impact the availability and competitiveness of travel products offered on our websites 
our arrangements with suppliers and other travel partners may not remain in effect on current or similar terms  and the net impact of future pricing or revenue sharing options may adversely impact our revenue 
for example  our suppliers and other travel partners could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us on more favorable terms to them  which could reduce the revenue we generate from those agreements 
the significant reduction by any of our major suppliers or travel partners in their business with our companies for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal of doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we currently depend on one of travelport s businesses  gullivers travel associates gta  for access to hotel inventory in certain international regions while we work to increase our own direct relationships with hotel suppliers in these regions 
if we are unable to successfully establish direct relationships with hotel suppliers or to replace our access to hotel inventory currently provided by gta in a timely manner or on comparable terms  we may not be able to operate our business effectively  and our financial performance may suffer 
our arrangements with the airlines generally do not require the airlines to provide any specific quantity of airline tickets or to make tickets available for any particular route or at any particular price 
in addition  certain airlines may terminate their agreements with us for any reason or no reason prior to the scheduled expiration date upon thirty days prior notice 
the significant reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their participation with us for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our relationships with the airlines may be impacted by developments in the airline industry  such as increasing consolidation or shifts in market share from full service to low cost carriers 
some low cost carriers  such as southwest airlines  have not historically distributed their tickets through third party intermediaries 
because our gds service agreement with travelport limits our ability to modify our existing agreements with the airlines or to enter into new  direct distribution arrangements  we may have limited flexibility to respond to developments in the airline industry  and we may be forced to forgo new partnering opportunities 
see we are 
table of contents dependent on travelport for our gds services below 
the limitations imposed by the gds service agreement may place us at a competitive disadvantage and could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
our business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by adverse tax events 
new sales  use  occupancy or other tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time 
such enactments could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations and our business and financial performance 
further  existing tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be interpreted  changed  modified or applied adversely to us 
these events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis  as well as require us to pay fees  penalties and or interest for past amounts deemed to be due 
in addition  our revenue may decline because we could have to charge more for our products and services 
new  changed  modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could also increase our compliance  operating and other costs  as well as the costs of our products or services 
further  these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business 
any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
we also have a million receivable included in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  related to amounts due to us from cendant now avis budget group  inc for a portion of the tax sharing liability with the founding airlines 
cendant is obligated to pay us this amount when it receives the tax benefit 
if we were  in the future  to determine that all or a portion of this receivable is not collectable  the portion of this receivable that was no longer deemed collectable would be charged to expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we and others in the online travel industry are currently subject to various lawsuits related to hotel occupancy tax in numerous jurisdictions in the us  and other jurisdictions may be considering similar lawsuits 
an adverse ruling in the existing hotel occupancy tax cases could require us to pay tax retroactively and prospectively  and possibly penalties  interest and or fees 
we have also been contacted by several municipalities or other taxing bodies concerning our possible obligation with respect to local hotel occupancy or related taxes  and certain municipalities have begun audit proceedings and some have issued assessments against the company 
if the company is found to be subject to the hotel occupancy tax ordinance by a taxing authority and appeals the decision in court  certain jurisdictions may attempt to require us to provide financial security or pay the assessment in order to challenge the tax assessment in court 
the proliferation of new hotel occupancy tax cases or audit proceedings could result in substantial additional defense costs 
these events could also adversely impact our business and financial performance see item  legal proceedings 
our businesses are highly regulated  and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect us 
we operate in a highly regulated industry both in the us and internationally 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or the enactment of new laws  rules and regulations applicable to us  which could decrease demand for our products and services  increase costs or subject us to additional liabilities 
moreover  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
accordingly  these regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority 
our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another 
our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to our revenue generating and marketing activities  including those prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising or practices 
our travel services are subject to regulation and laws governing the offer of travel products and services  including laws requiring us to register as a seller of travel in various jurisdictions and to comply with certain disclosure requirements 
as an otc 
table of contents that offers customers the ability to book air travel in the us  we are also subject to regulation by the department of transportation  which has authority to enforce economic regulations and may assess civil penalties or challenge our operating authority 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and potential criminal violations 
any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our businesses and may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation  conflicting legal requirements  differing views of personal privacy rights or security breaches 
in the processing of customer transactions  we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information 
this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
this legislation and regulation is generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information  including credit card information  that is collected  processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 
we could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices  or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business 
travel companies have also been subjected to investigations  lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information 
as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues  we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data 
these and other privacy concerns  including security breaches  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining customer and supplier confidence in our services 
substantial or ongoing security breaches  whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based systems  could significantly harm our business 
we currently require customers to guarantee their transactions with their credit cards online 
we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential customer information  including credit card numbers 
it is possible that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data 
we incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences 
however  our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our remediation plan to address these potential exposures 
a party whether internal  external  an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations 
security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security  which would have a negative effect on the demand for our products and services 
moreover  public perception concerning security and privacy on the internet could adversely affect customers willingness to use our websites 
a publicized breach of security  even if it only affects other companies conducting business over the internet  could inhibit the growth of the internet and  therefore  our services as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes  which could harm us 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including  but not limited to  actions relating to intellectual property  in particular patent infringement claims against us  tax matters  employment law and other 
table of contents negligence  breach of contract and fraud claims  that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations 
the defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive 
if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  historically  our insurers have reimbursed us for a significant portion of costs we incurred to defend the hotel occupancy tax cases 
if in the future these costs are reimbursed at a lower rate  or not at all  our results of operations would be adversely impacted 
we may not protect our intellectual property effectively  which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and services 
this could make it more difficult for us to compete with them 
our success and ability to compete depend  in part  upon our technology and other intellectual property  including our brands 
among our significant assets are our software and other proprietary information and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect these assets 
however  we have a limited number of patents  and our software and related documentation are protected principally under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and the laws of some jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the us we have granted travelport an exclusive license to our supplier link technology  including our patents related to that technology 
under the exclusive license  travelport has the first right to enforce those patents  and so we will only be able to bring actions to enforce those patents if travelport declines to do so 
unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  and the legal remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use 
further  intellectual property challenges have been increasingly brought against members of the travel industry 
these legal actions have in the past and might in the future result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
in addition  we may need to take legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  and these enforcement actions could result in the invalidation or other impairment of intellectual property rights we assert 
travelport s controlling holders control us and may have strategic interests that differ from ours or our other shareholders 
currently  travelport and investment funds that own and or control travelport s ultimate parent company beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock and therefore  indirectly control us and all of our subsidiaries 
as a result of this ownership  travelport s controlling holders are entitled to nominate and elect all of our directors and own sufficient shares to determine the outcome of any actions requiring the approval of our stockholders  including adopting most amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving or rejecting proposed mergers  significant new investments or divestments or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of travelport s controlling holders may differ from those of our public shareholders in material respects 
travelport s controlling holders and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments 
they currently have  and may from time to time in the future acquire  interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers or businesses on which we are substantially dependent  such as the travelport gdss 
in an effort to increase its revenues and improve its overall profitability  travelport could seek to change the terms of its commercial relationships with its gds customers 
because we are limited in our ability to pursue alternative gds options or direct connections with suppliers during the term of our gds agreement with travelport  any such actions by travelport could make us a less attractive distribution channel to our suppliers  who could attempt to terminate or renegotiate their agreements with us  and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other online travel companies 
see we are dependent on travelport for our gds services below 
in addition  travelport s customers  many of which are also major suppliers to us  have previously sought and may in the future seek to exert commercial leverage over us in an effort to obtain 
table of contents concessions from travelport  which could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as long as travelport s controlling holders continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding voting stock  even if that amount is less than  they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control us 
the interests of these holders may differ from our other shareholders interests in material respects 
actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between our management and directors as well as the management and directors of travelport 
jeff clarke serves as chairman of our board of directors  while retaining his role as president  chief executive officer and director of travelport 
the fact that mr 
clarke holds positions with both travelport and us could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest for him when he faces decisions that may affect both travelport and us 
in addition  mr 
paul c 
schorr iv  who is a senior managing director at the blackstone group  and mr 
william jg griffith  who is a general partner of tcv  both currently serve on the board of directors of travelport and serve on our board of directors 
the fact that mr 
schorr and mr 
griffith hold positions with their respective entities  travelport and us  could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when they face decisions that may affect two or more of these entities 
in addition  jill a 
greenthal  who is a senior advisor in the private equity group of the blackstone group  currently serves on our board of directors 
affiliates of the blackstone group exercise control over travelport s ultimate parent company and therefore  the fact that ms 
greenthal holds a position with the blackstone group could create  or appear to create  a potential conflict of interest when she faces decisions that affect both travelport and us 
further  our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of travelport who is also an officer or director of ours may be liable to us or our stockholders for a breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to travelport instead of us or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to travelport 
these provisions may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between travelport and us because the provisions effectively shield an overlapping director executive 
because of their former positions with travelport or its subsidiaries  certain members of our senior management team have equity interests in travelport s ultimate parent company  some of which may be significant relative to their total assets 
continued ownership by our officers of these interests creates  or may create  the appearance of conflicts of interest when these officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for travelport than the decisions have for us 
potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between travelport and us regarding the terms of commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates 
potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any other commercial arrangements with travelport in the future 
we are dependent on travelport for our gds services 
to varying extents  suppliers use gdss to connect their products and services with travel companies  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
under our gds service agreement with travelport  we are required  subject to certain exceptions  to utilize galileo and worldspan  which are subsidiaries of travelport  for a significant portion of our gds services  and our contractual obligations to travelport for gds services may limit our ability to pursue alternative gds options 
as a result  if travelport became unwilling or was unable to provide these services to us  we may not be able to obtain alternative providers on a commercially reasonable basis  in a timely manner or at all  and our business would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  our gds service agreement with travelport limits our ability to modify the terms of our agreements with existing suppliers or to pursue direct connections with new or existing suppliers during the term of the agreement  which expires on december  these contractual obligations may reduce our

travelport and its affiliates are permitted to use our intellectual property to provide their own products and services to third parties that compete with us

our brand portfolio includes orbitz  cheaptickets  the away network  and orbitz for business in the americas  ebookers in europe  and hotelclub based in sydney  australia  which has operations globally 
we provide customers with the ability to book a comprehensive set of travel products and services from suppliers worldwide  including air travel  hotels  vacation packages  car rentals  cruises  travel insurance and destination services such as ground transportation  event tickets and tours 
our strategic focus is on driving global hotel transaction growth 
see item  business company strategy for a discussion of our strategic initiatives 
we generate revenue primarily from the booking of travel products and services on our websites 
we provide customers the ability to book travel products and services on both a standalone basis and as part of a dynamic vacation package  primarily through our merchant and retail business models 
under our merchant model  we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that product 
under our retail model  we earn commissions from suppliers for airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals and other travel products and services booked on our websites 
in addition  under both the merchant and retail business models  we may  depending upon the brand and the travel product  earn revenue by charging customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation on our websites see industry trends below 
we also receive incentive payments for air  car and hotel segments that are processed through a global distribution system gds 
we also generate advertising revenue through our partner marketing programs 
these programs provide access to our customers through a combination of display advertising  performance based advertising and other marketing programs 
in addition  we generate revenue from our private label and hosting businesses 
we earn revenue from our private label business through revenue sharing arrangements for travel booked on third party websites 
we earn revenue from our hosting business through license or fee arrangements 

table of contents we took significant steps in to improve our customer value proposition by launching total price hotel search results and orbitz hotel price assurance  both of which are industry leading innovations 
we also removed our hotel change and cancellation fees and reduced booking fees on hotels booked through orbitz 
com and cheaptickets 
com 
we believe these improvements to our global hotel offering deliver value to our customers and should improve our competitiveness over time 
in light of current economic and industry conditions  we are also focused on improving our operating and marketing efficiency  simplifying the way we do business  and continuing to innovate 
in late and in  we lowered our cost structure by reducing our global workforce and use of contract labor and by cutting various other operating and capital costs 
we also completed the launch of a common technology platform for all of our ebookers websites in europe 
we will continue to focus on opportunities to further streamline our cost structure 
we believe these actions will position us to more effectively compete in this challenging environment 
industry trends the economic recession significantly impacted the travel industry during as demand for air travel continued to be weak  certain domestic and international airlines reduced capacity and reduced ticket prices in to levels significantly below levels to drive volume 
we expect airline capacity to increase nominally in as compared with however  bankruptcies and consolidation in the airline industry could result in further capacity reductions  which would reduce the number of airline tickets available for booking on online travel companies otcs websites 
in  certain otcs who historically charged booking fees  including us  eliminated booking fees on most  if not all  flights and reduced booking fees on hotels 
we believe these fee actions will be permanent 
the elimination of air booking fees on otcs websites has significantly reduced the net revenue that otcs generate from airline tickets 
we were able to offset most of the impact of the fee reduction in through our cost reductions  our improved marketing efficiency and the increase in air transactions we have experienced since removing fees 
fundamentals in the us hotel industry appear to be stabilizing but continue to be weak 
hotel occupancy rates and average daily rates adrs continued to decline in we believe that hotel suppliers will maintain adrs at levels similar to in an attempt to increase hotel occupancy 
fundamentals in the european and asia pacific hotel industries are also weak 
lower adrs reduce the net revenue that otcs earn on hotel bookings 
the economic recession has also significantly impacted the car rental industry 
as a result of lower demand for air travel  demand for car rentals declined in in addition  car rental companies reduced their rental car fleets in  which resulted in a significant increase in adrs for domestic car rentals 
this increase in adrs partially offset the negative impact of reduced demand for car rentals 
in  we expect demand for car rentals to improve as car rental companies increase their fleet sizes and demand for air travel improves 
we believe that our gross bookings and net revenue for the years ended december  and december  were significantly negatively impacted by the economic and industry conditions described above 
although we have begun to see initial signs of a recovery in the economy and industry fundamentals  we expect weak economic conditions will continue to impact our gross bookings and net revenue in in response to economic and industry conditions  in late and in  we lowered our cost structure by reducing our global workforce and use of contract labor and by cutting various other operating and capital costs 
in  we also significantly restructured our approach to marketing  placing greater emphasis on attracting more traffic to our websites through search engine optimization seo and customer relationship management crm and improving the efficiency of our search engine marketing sem and travel research spending 
the growth rate of online travel bookings in the domestic market has slowed due to both the maturity of this market and weak economic conditions 
going forward  we believe that growth rates in the domestic online 
table of contents travel market will be more closely aligned with the growth rates of the overall travel industry 
internationally  the online travel industry continues to benefit from rapidly increasing internet usage and growing acceptance of online booking 
we expect international growth rates for the online travel industry will continue to outpace growth rates of the overall travel industry 
we believe that otcs will continue to focus on differentiating themselves from supplier websites in a variety of ways  including offering customers the ability to selectively combine travel products such as air  car  hotel and destination services into dynamic vacation packages 
through dynamic vacation packages  we make certain products available to our customers at prices that are generally lower than booking each travel product separately 
we foresee growth potential for otcs for these types of services  particularly since travelers are increasingly price sensitive 
our net revenue per transaction is generally higher for dynamic vacation packages than for travel products booked separately 
otcs make significant investments in marketing through both online and traditional offline channels 
key areas of online marketing include sem  travel research  display advertising  affiliate programs and email marketing 
search engine marketing costs have been rising in the us over time  although to a lesser extent in the current economic environment  and competition for search engine key words continues to be intense 
if these trends continue  we could experience lower margins or declines in transaction growth rates 
we are actively pursuing strategies to improve the efficiency of our marketing efforts 
these strategies include increasing the amount of non paid traffic coming to our websites through seo and customer relationship management and eliminating unprofitable sem and travel research spending 
our retailing efforts are designed to improve conversion and ultimately reclaim previously unprofitable sem and travel research transactions on a profitable basis

benefit provision for income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  and a tax provision of million for the year ended december  the tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  related to certain of our international subsidiaries 
the amount of the tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  was disproportionate to the amount of pre tax net loss incurred during the year primarily because we were not able to realize any tax benefit on the goodwill impairment charge and only a limited amount of tax benefit on the trademarks and trade names impairment charge recorded during the year ended december  the tax provision recorded during the year ended december  was primarily due to a valuation allowance established in the third quarter of against million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  net of tax  related to portions of our uk based business

liquidity and capital resources liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
at december  and december   our cash and cash equivalents balances were million and million  respectively 
we had million and million of availability under our revolving credit facility at december  and december   respectively 
this availability reflects the effective reduction in total availability under our revolving credit facility in following the bankruptcy of lehman commercial paper inc lcpi as described in financing arrangements below 
total available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we require letters of credit to support certain commercial agreements  leases and certain regulatory agreements 
the majority of these letters of credit have been issued by travelport on our behalf 
at 
table of contents december  and december   there were million and million of outstanding letters of credit issued by travelport on our behalf  respectively  pursuant to the separation agreement  as amended  that we entered into with travelport in connection with the ipo the separation agreement 
under the separation agreement  travelport has agreed to issue us dollar denominated letters of credit on our behalf in an aggregate amount not to exceed million through at least march  and thereafter so long as travelport and its affiliates as defined in the separation agreement own at least of our voting stock 
in addition  at december   there was the equivalent of million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility  which were denominated in pounds sterling 
there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility at december  the amount of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility reduces the amount available to us for borrowings 
in january  certain regulatory requirements required us to provide additional letters of credit of million  million of which were denominated in us dollars and issued by travelport on our behalf and the equivalent of million of which were denominated in pounds sterling and issued under our revolving credit facility 
under our merchant model  customers generally pay us for reservations at the time of booking  and we pay our suppliers at a later date  which is generally after the customer uses the reservation 
initially  we record these customer receipts as accrued merchant payables and either deferred income or net revenue  depending on the travel product 
we generally recognize net revenue when the customer uses the reservation  and we pay our suppliers once we have received an invoice  which typically ranges from one to sixty days after the customer uses the reservation 
the timing difference between when cash is collected from our customers and when payments are made to our suppliers improves our operating cash flow and represents a source of liquidity for us 
if our merchant model gross bookings increase  we would expect our operating cash flow to increase 
conversely  if our merchant model gross bookings decline or there are changes to the model which reduce the time between the receipt of cash from our customers and payments to suppliers  we would expect our operating cash flow to decline 
historically  under both our merchant and retail models  we charged customers a service fee for booking airline tickets  hotel stays and certain other travel products on our websites  and cash generated by these booking fees represented a significant portion of our operating cash flow and a source of liquidity for us 
in  we removed booking fees on most flights booked through orbitz 
com and cheaptickets 
com  and we significantly reduced booking fees on all hotel stays booked through orbitz 
com and cheaptickets 
com 
the combination of our cost reductions  our improved marketing efficiency and the increase in air transactions we have experienced since removing fees enabled us to offset most  if not all  of the decrease in our operating cash flow and liquidity due to lower booking fees 
if we are unable to effectively continue to offset the impact of the booking fee reductions  our cash flow and liquidity could be materially reduced 
seasonal fluctuations in our business also affect the timing of our cash flows 
gross bookings are generally highest in the first half of the year as customers plan and purchase their spring and summer vacations 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first half of the year 
we generally have net cash outflows during the second half of the year since cash payments to suppliers typically exceed the cash inflows from new merchant booking reservations 
while we expect this seasonal cash flow pattern to continue  changes in our business model could affect the seasonal nature of our cash flows 
in  in light of concerns about the financial industry and in order to ensure availability of liquidity  we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility  which increased our cash position throughout year 
we repaid million of these borrowings during the fourth quarter of and repaid the remaining borrowings during the first quarter of on january   we completed two transactions that improved our overall liquidity and financial position 
in the first transaction  par investment partners lp par exchanged million principal amount of term loans under our senior secured credit agreement for  shares of our common stock 
we immediately retired the term loans received from par in accordance with the amendment to the credit agreement that we entered into with our lenders in june as a result  the amount outstanding on the 
table of contents term loan was reduced to million 
concurrently  travelport  through one if its controlled affiliates  purchased  shares of our common stock for million in cash see note exchange agreement and stock purchase agreement of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we intend to use the proceeds from the stock purchase for general corporate purposes  which could include additional capital investments and or further debt reduction 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million as compared with a deficit of million as of december  prior to the ipo  we operated with a working capital deficit primarily as a result of the cash management system used by travelport to pool cash from all of its subsidiaries  including us  as well as the fact that certain operating cash flows generated by us were used to fund certain of our financing and investing activities  such as capital expenditures incurred for the development and implementation of our new technology platform 
the net proceeds we received from the ipo of our common stock and the million term loan did not decrease this working capital deficit because those proceeds were used to repay million of intercompany notes payable to affiliates of travelport  to pay a million dividend to an affiliate of travelport and to settle other intercompany balances between us and travelport that were generated prior to the ipo 
as a result  immediately following the ipo  we continued to have a working capital deficit 
because of this deficit  we use cash from customer transactions as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital requirements and certain investing and financing commitments  such as capital expenditures and principal payments on our term loan  respectively 
over time  we expect to continue to decrease this deficit through growth in our business and the generation of positive cash flow from operations  which we expect to achieve by driving global hotel transaction growth and by continuing to offer new and innovative functionality on our websites  improving our operating efficiency and simplifying the way we do business 
we generated positive cash flow from operations for the years ended december  through despite experiencing net losses  and we expect annual cash flow from operations to remain positive in the foreseeable future 
we generally use this cash flow to fund our operations  make principal and interest payments on our debt  finance capital expenditures and meet our other cash operating needs 
for the year ended december   we expect our capital expenditures to be between million and million  most of which is discretionary in nature 
we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently believe that cash flow generated from operations  cash on hand and cash available under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations over at least the next twelve months 
however  in the future  our liquidity could be reduced as a result of changes in our business model  including changes to payment terms or other requirements imposed by suppliers or regulatory agencies  lower than anticipated operating cash flows  or other unanticipated events  such as unfavorable outcomes in our legal proceedings  including in the case of hotel occupancy proceedings  certain jurisdictions requirements that we provide financial security or pay the assessment to the municipality in order to challenge the assessment in court 
the liquidity provided by cash flows from our merchant model gross bookings could be negatively impacted if our merchant model gross bookings decline as a result of economic conditions or other factors or if suppliers or regulatory agencies imposed other requirements on us  such as requiring us to provide letters of credit or to establish cash reserves 
if as a result of these requirements  we require letters of credit which exceed the availability under the facility provided by travelport  or if the travelport facility is no longer available to us  we would be required to issue these letters of credit under our revolving credit facility or to establish cash reserves which would reduce our available liquidity 
in regards to our long term liquidity needs  we believe that cash flow generated from operations  cash on hand and cash available under our revolving credit facility through its maturity in july will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures 
however  unless we re finance our term loan before the july maturity date  we will be required to pay the final installment equal to the remaining outstanding balance on our million term loan  and our cash flow generated from operations and cash on hand may not be adequate to fund this payment in full 
as a result  we may need to raise 
table of contents additional funds through debt or equity offerings 
we also may be required to raise additional capital if  in the future  we require more liquidity than is available under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows our net cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the periods indicated in the tables below were as follows years ended december  in millions beginning cash and cash equivalents cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents ending cash and cash equivalents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  operating activities cash provided by operating activities consists of net loss  adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and stock based compensation and changes in various working capital items  principally accounts receivable  accrued expenses  accrued merchant payables  deferred income and accounts payable 
we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to cost reductions taken by us in  improvements in our overall marketing efficiency and a decrease in cash interest payments 
these operating cash flow increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to lower merchant hotel gross bookings in the first three quarters of compared with the first three quarters of  as a result of lower global adrs 
the elimination of most air booking fees  the reduction of hotel booking fees and the shortening of payment terms with a key vendor during also negatively impacted our operating cash flow 
the changes in our working capital accounts  which are partially due to the factors mentioned above and to the general timing of payments  also contributed to the increase in our operating cash flow 
during the fourth quarter of  there was a significant increase in merchant bookings compared with the fourth quarter of  which also drove the increase in operating cash flow for the year ended december  investing activities cash flow used in investing activities decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to lower capital spending during the year ended december  resulting from cost reduction efforts taken in late and 
table of contents financing activities cash flow used in financing activities decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million decrease in payments made under the tax sharing agreement with the founding airlines  a decrease in capital lease payments and a decrease in payments made to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of equity based awards 
the decrease in cash flow used in financing activities is partially offset by million of payments made by us in june to purchase million in principal amount of the term loan see note term loan and revolving credit facility of the notes to consolidated financial statements and a decrease in net borrowings made under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  operating activities we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flows was largely driven by a million decrease in cash interest expense due to the repayment of intercompany notes to travelport in connection with the ipo  offset in part by a million increase in cash interest expense incurred on our million revolving credit facility  the million term loan and the corresponding interest rate swaps entered into to hedge a portion of the variable interest payments on the term loan 
accrued expenses drove an additional million increase in operating cash flows 
this increase was primarily driven by the timing of payments of domestic accrued marketing expenditures 
the remaining increase in operating cash flows during the year ended december  was primarily due to the overall growth of our operations 
the cash flow increases discussed above were partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable  driven largely by timing of payments  as a result of changes in our payment mechanisms and cash management policies following the ipo 
a million decrease in accrued merchant payables and an million decrease in deferred income also offset the cash flow increases 
these decreases were primarily driven by a decrease in transaction volume  particularly for hotel bookings  during the fourth quarter of the cash flow increases above were further offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities cash flow used in investing activities decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to the sale of an offline uk travel subsidiary in july the sale of this subsidiary resulted in a million reduction in cash due to the buyer s assumption of this subsidiary s cash balance at the time of sale  partially offset by the cash proceeds we received for the sale of the subsidiary 
this decrease in cash flow used in investing activities was partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures as well as the absence of the receipt of proceeds from asset sales during we received million of cash proceeds from asset sales during financing activities cash flow used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million of cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities of million was partially due to the absence of net proceeds received from the ipo and the million term loan facility entered into concurrent with the ipo  offset in part by repayments of the intercompany notes to travelport  a dividend paid to travelport in connection with the ipo and net cash distributed to and received from travelport in prior to the ipo 
following the ipo  we are no longer required to distribute available cash to travelport 
cash flow used in financing activities increased largely due to million of payments made under the tax sharing agreement with the founding airlines  a million increase in principal payments made on the million term loan facility and million of payments made to satisfy employee minimum tax withholding obligations upon 
table of contents vesting of equity based awards during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities was offset in part by a million increase in borrowings made under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december  and a million decrease in capital lease payments 
financing arrangements on july   concurrent with the ipo  we entered into a million senior secured credit agreement credit agreement consisting of a seven year million term loan facility term loan and a six year million revolving credit facility revolver 
the term loan and the revolver bear interest at variable rates  at our option  of libor or an alternative base rate plus a margin 
at december  and december   million and million was outstanding on the term loan  respectively  and million and million of borrowings were outstanding under the revolver  respectively  all of which were denominated in us dollars 
in addition  at december   there was the equivalent of million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolver  which were denominated in pounds sterling 
there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolver at december  the amount of letters of credit issued under the revolver reduces the amount available to us for borrowings 
on june   we entered into an amendment the amendment to our credit agreement  which permits us to purchase portions of the outstanding term loan on a non pro rata basis using cash up to million and future cash proceeds from equity issuances and in exchange for equity interests on or prior to june  any portion of the term loan purchased by us will be retired pursuant to the terms of the amendment 
on june   we completed the purchase of million in principal amount of the term loan  as required by the terms of the amendment see note term loan and revolving credit facility of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and on january   we completed the purchase of an additional million in principal amount of the term loan see note subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
lcpi  which filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code on october   held a million commitment  or percent  of the million available under the revolver 
as a result  total availability under the revolver has effectively been reduced from million to million 
despite this reduction  we currently believe that our cash flow generated from operations  cash on hand and cash available under the revolver will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations in the short term see liquidity above 
the term loan and revolver are both secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets  including a pledge of of the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock or other equity interests of certain of our foreign subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
the term loan and revolver are also guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains various customary restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or enter into guarantees  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or acquisitions  grant or incur liens on our assets  sell our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  engage in transactions with affiliates  and make restricted payments 

table of contents the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and not to exceed a maximum total leverage ratio  each as defined in the credit agreement 
the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that we are required to maintain as of december  and for the remaining term of the credit agreement is to the maximum total leverage ratio that we are required not to exceed is to as of december  and declines to to effective march  and to to effective march  if we fail to comply with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts borrowed under the term loan and revolver and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness 
we are permitted  however  to cure any such failure by issuing equity to certain permitted holders  as defined in the credit agreement  which include the blackstone group and certain of its affiliates 
the amount of the net cash proceeds received from this equity issuance would then be applied to increase consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement and on which the covenant calculations are based  for the applicable quarter 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions of the credit agreement 
in addition  beginning in the first quarter of  we are required to make an annual prepayment on the term loan in the first quarter of each fiscal year in an amount up to of the prior year s excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
these prepayments from excess cash flow are applied  in order of maturity  to the scheduled quarterly term loan principal payments 
based on our cash flow for the year ended december   we were not required to make a prepayment in based on our cash flow for the year ended december   we are required to make a prepayment on the term loan of million in the first quarter of the potential amount of prepayment from excess cash flow that will be required beyond the first quarter of is not reasonably estimable as of december  when we were a wholly owned subsidiary of travelport  travelport provided guarantees  letters of credit and surety bonds on our behalf under our commercial agreements and leases and for the benefit of regulatory agencies 
under the separation agreement  we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to have travelport released from any then outstanding guarantees and surety bonds 
travelport no longer provides surety bonds on our behalf or guarantees in connection with commercial agreements or leases entered into or replaced by us subsequent to the ipo 
at december  and december   there were million and million of letters of credit issued by travelport on our behalf  respectively

litigation is inherently unpredictable and  although we believe we have valid defenses in these matters based upon advice of counsel  unfavorable resolutions could occur 
while we cannot estimate our range of loss and believe it is unlikely that an adverse outcome will result from these proceedings  an adverse outcome could be material to us with respect to earnings or cash flows in any given reporting period 
we are currently seeking to recover insurance reimbursement for costs incurred to defend the hotel occupancy tax cases 
we recorded a reduction to selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations for reimbursements received of million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively

d in connection with the ipo  we entered into an agreement with travelport to use gds services provided by both galileo and worldspan the travelport gds service agreement 
the travelport gds service agreement is structured such that we earn incentive revenue for each segment that is processed through the worldspan and galileo gdss the travelport gdss 
this agreement requires that we process a certain minimum number of segments for our domestic brands through the travelport gdss each year 
our domestic brands were required to process a total of million segments during the year ended december   million segments through worldspan and million segments through galileo 
the required number of segments processed annually for worldspan is fixed at million segments  while the required number of segments for galileo is subject to adjustment based upon the actual segments processed by our domestic brands in the preceding year 
we are required to process approximately million 
table of contents segments through galileo during the year ending december  our failure to process at least of these segments through the travelport gdss would result in a shortfall payment of per segment below the required minimum 
historically  we have met the minimum segment requirement for our domestic brands 
the table above includes shortfall payments required by the agreement if we do not process any segments through worldspan during the remainder of the contract term and shortfall payments required if we do not process any segments through galileo during the year ending december  because the required number of segments for galileo adjusts based on the actual segments processed in the preceding year  we are unable to predict shortfall payments that may be required beyond however  we do not expect to make any shortfall payments for our domestic brands in the foreseeable future 
the travelport gds service agreement also requires that ebookers use the travelport gdss exclusively in certain countries for segments processed through gdss in europe 
our failure to process at least of these segments through the travelport gdss would result in a shortfall payment of per segment for each segment processed through an alternative gds provider 
we failed to meet this minimum segment requirement during each of the years ended december  and december   and as a result  we were required to make nominal shortfall payments to travelport related to each of these years 
because the required number of segments to be processed through the travelport gdss is dependent on the actual segments processed by ebookers in certain countries in a given year  we are unable to predict shortfall payments that may be required for the years beyond as a result  the table above excludes any shortfall payments that may be required related to our ebookers brands for the years beyond if we meet the minimum number of segments  we are not required to make shortfall payments to travelport see note related party transactions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
e we expect to make approximately million of payments in connection with the tax sharing agreement with the founding airlines see note tax sharing liability of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
f excluded from the above table are million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which the period of settlement is not currently determinable 
other commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we obtain surety bonds and bank guarantees  issued for the benefit of a third party  to secure performance of certain of our obligations to third parties see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are also required to issue letters of credit to certain suppliers and non us regulatory and government agencies 
see financing arrangements above for further discussion of our outstanding letters of credit 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it meets the following two criteria the policy requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used when preparing our consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
we have discussed these estimates with our audit committee 

table of contents presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect our reported results 
although we believe these policies to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements and certain of these policies may also require the use of estimates and assumptions see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record revenue earned net of all amounts paid to our suppliers under both our retail and merchant models 
we offer customers the ability to book airline  hotel  car rental and other travel reservations through our various brands  including orbitz  cheaptickets  ebookers and hotelclub 
these products and services are made available to our customers for booking on a stand alone basis or as part of a dynamic vacation package 
we have two primary types of contractual arrangements with our vendors  which we refer to herein as the merchant and retail models 
under the merchant model  we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges for that travel product 
customers generally pay for reservations in advance  at the time of booking 
initially  we record these advance payments as accrued merchant payables and either deferred income or net revenue  depending on the travel product 
in the merchant model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  however we are subject to fraud risk  we have the ability to determine the price  we are not responsible for the actual delivery of the flight  hotel room or car rental  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
we recognize net revenue under the merchant model when we have no further obligations to the customer 
for merchant air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for merchant hotel transactions and merchant car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively 
the timing of revenue recognition is different for merchant air travel because our primary service to the customer is fulfilled at the time of booking 
we accrue for the cost of merchant hotel and merchant car transactions based on amounts we expect to be invoiced by suppliers 
if we do not receive an invoice within a certain period of time  generally within six months  or the invoice received is less than the accrued amount  we reverse a portion of the accrued cost when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier  based on our historical experience and contract terms 
this would result in an increase in net revenue and a decrease to the accrued merchant payable 
under the retail model  we pass reservations booked by our customers to the travel supplier for a commission 
under this model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  we are not the primary obligor with the customer  we have no latitude in determining pricing  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
we recognize net revenue under the retail model when the reservation is made  secured by a customer with a credit card and we have no further obligations to the customer 
for air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for hotel transactions and car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively  net of an allowance for cancelled reservations 
the timing of recognition is different for retail hotel and retail car transactions than for retail air travel because unlike air travel where the reservation is secured by a customer s credit card at booking  car rental bookings and hotel bookings are not secured by a customer s credit card until the pick up date and check in date  respectively 
allowances for cancelled reservations primarily relate to cancellations that do not occur through our website  but instead occur directly through the supplier of the travel product 
the amount of the allowance is determined based on our 
table of contents historical experience 
the majority of commissions earned under the retail model are based upon contractual agreements 
dynamic vacation packages offer customers the ability to book a combination of travel products 
for example  travel products booked in a dynamic vacation package may include a combination of air  hotel and car reservations 
we recognize net revenue for the entire package when the customer uses the reservation  which generally occurs on the same day for each travel product included in the dynamic vacation package 
under both the merchant and retail models  we may  depending upon the brand and the travel product  charge our customers a service fee for booking the travel reservation 
we recognize revenue for service fees at the time we recognize the net revenue for the corresponding travel product 
we also may receive override commissions from suppliers if we meet certain contractual volume thresholds 
these commissions are recognized when the amount of the commissions becomes fixed or determinable  which is generally upon notification by the respective travel supplier 
we utilize gds services provided by galileo  worldspan and amadeus it group 
under our gds service agreements  we earn revenue in the form of an incentive payment for air  car and hotel segments that are processed through a gds 
revenue is recognized for these incentive payments at the time the travel reservation is processed through the gds  which is generally at the time of booking 
we also generate other revenue  which is primarily comprised of revenue from advertising  including sponsoring links on our websites  and travel insurance 
advertising revenue is derived primarily from the delivery of advertisements on our websites and is recognized either at the time of display of each individual advertisement  or ratably over the advertising delivery period  depending on the terms of the advertising contract 
revenues generated from sponsoring links and travel insurance revenue are both recognized upon notification from the alliance partner that a transaction has occurred 
if our judgments regarding net revenue are inaccurate  actual net revenue could differ from the amount we recognize  directly impacting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets  when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows to be generated from these assets  on an undiscounted basis 
if this analysis indicates that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations 
the evaluation of long lived assets for impairment requires assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows 
an estimate of future cash flows requires us to assess current and projected market conditions as well as operating performance 
a variation of the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events occur and circumstances change indicating potential impairment 
we perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year  in connection with our annual planning process 
we assess goodwill for possible impairment using a two step process 
the first step identifies if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if step one indicates that an impairment may exist  a second step is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires management s judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our 
table of contents reporting units to which goodwill is allocated using generally accepted valuation methodologies  including market and income based approaches  and relevant data available through and as of the testing date 
the market approach is a valuation method in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets 
under the market approach  the valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets 
the income approach is a method in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life  including residual value cash flows 
these cash flows are then discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money 
variations of the income approach are used to estimate certain of the intangible asset fair values 
our trademarks and trade names are indefinite lived intangible assets 
we test these assets for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  then the carrying value is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
we use a market or income valuation approach  as described above  to estimate fair values of the relevant trademarks and trade names 
our testing for impairment involves estimates of our future cash flows  which requires us to assess current and projected market conditions as well as operating performance 
our estimates may differ from actual cash flows due to changes in our operating performance  capital structure or requirements for operating and capital expenditures as well as changes to general economic conditions and the travel industry in particular 
we must also make estimates and judgments in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in those future cash flows 
the impairment analysis may also require certain assumptions about other businesses with limited financial histories 
a variation of the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the carrying value of an asset and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the combined federal and state effective tax rates that are applicable to us in a given year 
the deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
increases to the valuation allowance are recorded as increases to the provision for income taxes 
as a result of our adoption of updated guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board regarding business combinations  effective january   to the extent that any valuation allowances established by us in purchase accounting are reduced  these reductions are recorded through our consolidated statements of operations 
these reductions were previously recorded through goodwill 
the realization of the deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance  is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income 
a change in our estimate of future taxable income may require an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance 
for the period january  to february   the operations of travelport were included in the consolidated us federal and state income tax returns for the year ended december  for orbitz worldwide  inc and its subsidiaries 
however  the provision for income taxes was computed as if we filed our us federal  state and foreign income tax returns on a separate company basis without the inclusion of the operations of travelport 
furthermore  the separate company deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated using our tax rates on a separate company basis 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are based upon estimated differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities as of december  our tax assets and liabilities may be adjusted in connection with the ultimate finalization of travelport s income tax returns 
for the years ended december  and december   the provision for us federal  state and foreign income taxes and the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities were based solely on the operations of orbitz worldwide  inc and its subsidiaries 

table of contents accounting for tax sharing liability we have a liability included in our consolidated balance sheets that relates to a tax sharing agreement between orbitz and the founding airlines 
the agreement governs the allocation of tax benefits resulting from a taxable exchange that took place in connection with the orbitz initial public offering in december orbitz ipo 
as a result of this taxable exchange  the founding airlines incurred a taxable gain 
the taxable exchange caused orbitz to have additional future tax deductions for depreciation and amortization due to the increased tax basis of its assets 
the additional tax deductions for depreciation and amortization may reduce the amount of taxes we are required to pay in future years 
for each tax period during the term of the tax sharing agreement  we are obligated to pay the founding airlines a significant percentage of the amount of the tax benefit realized as a result of the taxable exchange 
the tax sharing agreement commenced upon consummation of the orbitz ipo and continues until all tax benefits have been utilized 
we use discounted cash flows in calculating and recognizing the tax sharing liability 
we review the calculation of the tax sharing liability on a quarterly basis and make revisions to our estimated timing of payments when appropriate 
we also assess whether there are any significant changes  such as changes in timing of payments and tax rates  that could materially affect the present value of the tax sharing liability 
although the expected gross remaining payments that may be due under this agreement are million as of december   the timing of payments may change 
any changes in timing of payments are recognized prospectively as accretions to the tax sharing liability in our consolidated balance sheets and non cash interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the valuation of the tax sharing liability requires us to make certain estimates in projecting the quarterly depreciation and amortization benefit we expect to receive  as well as the associated effective income tax rates 
the estimates require certain assumptions as to our future operating performance and taxable income  the tax rate  the timing of tax payments  current and projected market conditions  and the applicable discount rate 
the discount rate assumption is based on our weighted average cost of capital at the time of the blackstone acquisition  which was approximately 
a variation of the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the carrying value of the tax sharing liability and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the blackstone acquisition  cendant now avis budget group  inc indemnified travelport and us for a portion of the amounts due under the tax sharing agreement 
as a result  we have a million receivable included in other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  cendant is obligated to pay us this amount when it receives the tax benefit 
we regularly monitor the financial condition of cendant to assess the collectability of this receivable 
equity based compensation we measure equity based compensation cost at fair value and recognize the corresponding compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period during which awards are expected to vest 
we include equity based compensation expense in the selling  general and administrative line of our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the average of the high and low price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is determined on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model  which incorporates a number of variables  some of which are based on estimates and assumptions 
these variables include stock price  exercise price  expected life  expected volatility  dividend yield  and the risk free rate 
stock price and exercise price are set at fair value on the date of grant 
expected volatility is based on implied volatilities for publicly traded options and historical volatility for comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method 
we use the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected 
table of contents life of the stock options 
the risk free interest rate is based on yields on us treasury strips with a maturity similar to the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the amount of equity based compensation expense recorded each period is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical employee turnover rates  the terms of the award issued and assumptions regarding future employee turnover 
we periodically perform an analysis to determine if estimated forfeitures are reasonable based on actual facts and circumstances  and adjustments are made as necessary 
if our estimates differ significantly from actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be materially affected 
internal use software we capitalize the costs of software developed for internal use 
capitalization commences when the preliminary project stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended 
amortization commences when the software is placed into service 
we also capitalize interest on internal software development projects 
the amount of interest capitalized is computed by applying our weighted average borrowing rate to qualifying expenditures 
the determination of costs to be capitalized as well as the useful life of the software requires us to make estimates and judgments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
transaction exposure we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  intercompany transactions and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we primarily hedge our foreign currency exposure to the pound sterling  euro and australian dollar 
we do not engage in trading  market making or speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
the forward contracts utilized by us do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and as a result  any fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as incurred 
the fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts do  however  largely offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk that they are intended to economically hedge 
as of december  and december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional values equivalent to approximately million and million  respectively 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheets 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  was a net translation loss of million and million  respectively 
this loss is recognized as an adjustment to shareholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss 

table of contents interest rate risk the term loan and revolver bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or an alternative base rate 
we limit interest rate risk associated with the term loan using interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of million as of december  to hedge fluctuations in libor see note derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not engage in trading  market making or speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
sensitivity analysis we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on earnings  fair values  and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we used december  market rates to perform a sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures 
the estimates assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we determined  through this analysis  that the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million at december  compared with million at december  there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis  primarily due to assumptions that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
the effect of a hypothetical change in market rates of interest on interest expense would be almost nil at december  and december   respectively  which represents the effect on interest expense related to the unhedged portion of the term loan 
the hedged portion of the term loan is not affected by changes in market rates of interest as it has effectively been converted to a fixed interest rate through interest rate swaps
