item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we engineer  manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units  chillers  air handling units  make up air units  heat recovery units  condensing units  commercial self contained units and coils 
these products are marketed and sold to retail  manufacturing  educational  medical and other commercial industries 
we market units to all states in the united states and certain provinces in canada 
foreign sales were less than of our sales 
we sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers representatives and our internal sales force 
demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors 
the commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts  but has a lag factor of months 
housing starts  in turn  are affected by such factors as interest rates  the state of the economy  population growth and the relative age of the population 
when new construction is down  we emphasize the replacement market 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during and due to the economic environment 
prices decreased by approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from december  to december  we have entered into contracts that are below the average index price as of december  the lower commodity prices have contributed to our lower cost of goods sold and higher gross margins 
we entered into a derivative instrument in the third quarter of with a large financial institution to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
the derivative is in the form of a commodity futures contract 
the derivative contract settles monthly beginning in january and ending in december the contract is for a total of  pounds of copper at per pound 
the contract is for quantities equal to or less than those expected to be used in our manufacturing operations in we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition to our derivative instrument  we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
selling  general  and administrative sg a costs include our internal sales force  warranty costs  profit sharing and administrative expenses 
warranty expense is estimated based on historical trends and other factors 
our product warranty policy is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  and years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable 
warranty charges on heat exchangers do not occur frequently

office manufacturing facility 
the facility was classified as available for sale upon closure of our manufacturing operations in september we plan to sell the property within one year 
set forth below is income statement information and as a percentage of sales for years  and years ending december  in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes   income tax provision net income results of operations key events impacting our cash balance  financial condition and results of operations in include the following we remained the leader in the industry for environmentally friendly  energy efficient and quality innovations  utilizing ra refrigerant and phasing out pollutant causing r refrigerant 
the phase out of r began in early we also utilize a high performance composite foam panel to eliminate over half of the heat transfer from typical fiberglass insulated panels 
we continue to utilize sloped condenser coils and access compartments to filters  motor  and fans 
all of these innovations increase the demand for our products thus increasing market share 
we have attempted to moderate certain commodity costs by utilizing purchase agreements and pricing strategies which affect our gross margins 
in february  our board of directors initiated a program of semi annual cash dividend payments 
cash payments of million were made million paid in january and million paid in july  and accrued a liability for payment of million of dividends in january stock repurchases from our employees k savings and investments plan were authorized in stock repurchases from directors and officers were authorized in repurchases of our stock from the open market were authorized and initiated in november total repurchases resulted in cash payments of million 
this cash outlay is partially offset by cash received from options exercised by employees as a part of an incentive bonus program of million 
we have a strong liquidity position with cash on hand of million 
in view of the current economic environment  our goal remains to keep a healthy financial condition 
purchases of equipment and renovations to manufacturing facilities remained a priority 
our capital expenditures were million 
equipment purchases create significant efficiencies  lower production costs and allow continued growth in production 
we currently estimate dedicating million to capital expenditures in for continued growth 
we expanded a portion of our manufacturing facility in for future growth 
we closed our manufacturing operations and reclassified our canadian facility as held for sale in september the products previously manufactured at the canadian facility will be produced by the tulsa  oklahoma  and longview  texas  facilities in the future 
net sales net sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales decreased million or in from which was attributable to the decreased volume related to the current economic environment and lower sales from our canadian operations 
the current economic environment has negatively impacted commercial construction markets with some projects delayed  postponed indefinitely or cancelled 
the replacement market has also been affected by customers delaying equipment replacement as a cost saving strategy 
the increase in sales in from was due to an increase in volume of products sold related to our new and redesigned products being favorably received by our customers  the diversified customer mix of products  active marketing by sales representatives and pricing strategies implemented in order to keep up with the then increasing raw material costs 
new commercial construction steadily improved throughout  contributing to growth of the market 
gross profit gross margins were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross margins increased million in from as a percentage of sales  gross margins were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins percentage in from was primarily a result of lower material costs  improved production and labor efficiencies  a reduction in manufacturing related expenses and a million million net of tax unrealized gain from a derivative asset included in cost of sales  despite lower net sales and expenses associated with the canadian facility closure 
our gross margins as a percentage of sales excluding the unrealized gain were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit in from  resulted from pricing strategies implemented and production and labor efficiencies  as sales volume increased 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
we also purchase from other domestic manufacturers certain components  including compressors  electric motors and electrical controls used in our products 
the suppliers of these components are significantly affected by the raw material costs of steel  copper and aluminum used in their products 
the raw materials market was volatile during and due to the economic environment 
prices decreased by approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from december  to december  we have entered into contracts that are below the average index price as of december  the lower commodity prices have contributed to our lower cost of goods sold and higher gross margins 
we entered into a derivative instrument in the third quarter of with a large financial institution to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
the derivative is in the form of a commodity futures contract 
the derivative contract settles monthly beginning in january and ending in december the contract is for a total of  pounds of copper at per pound 
the contract is for quantities equal to or less than those expected to be used in our manufacturing operations in we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition to our derivative instrument  we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  our sg a expenses remained consistent with  despite lower sales volumes in compared to warranty expenses in increased due to specific warranty items and sales related expenses increased due to our expanded marketing to remain competitive in the current environment 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses in from was due primarily to an increase in selling related expenses  warranty expense caused by increased sales  increase in profit sharing resulting from an increase in net income  and an overall increase in general and administrative expenses 
interest expense interest expense was approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately  in from was due to fewer borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
we borrowed million from the revolving credit facility during compared to million during interest on borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of or libor plus at december  
the increase in interest expense in from was due to higher average borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a result of a decrease in net cash provided by operations related to the stock repurchases 
in  we borrowed million from the revolving credit facility 
average borrowings under the revolving credit facility are typically paid in full within the month of borrowing or the following month 
interest income interest income was approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income of approximately  in from was mainly due to interest income from a tax refund 
the increase in interest income in from was due to interest paid for repurchased stock that was held in transit by the transfer agent in early other income expense other income was approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income of approximately  in from was due to the termination of the lease on our expansion facility 
the increase in other income in from was primarily related to foreign currency translations that resulted from operations in canada 
other expense was approximately  in prior to the lease expiration in may  other income was primarily attributable to rental income from our expansion facility 
we began renovations on the expansion facility to give us increased manufacturing capacity upon expiration of the lease 
our capital expenditures budget reflects the projected outlay to remodel the facility 
impact of current economic conditions our business is affected by a number of economic factors  including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate 
the current state of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets 
the current decline in economic activity has resulted in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability 
sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built  which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits  employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time 
general our revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of million which is provided by the bank of oklahoma  national association 
under the line of credit  there is one standby letter of credit totaling million 
borrowings available under the revolving credit facility at december   were million 
the letter of credit is a requirement of our workers compensation insurance and was extended in and will expire december  interest on borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of or libor plus at december  
no fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   and  we were in compliance with our financial ratio covenants

at december  our tangible net worth was million which meets the requirement of being at or above million 
our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was to which meets the requirement of not being above to our working capital was million which meets the requirement of being at or above million 
on july   we renewed the line of credit with a maturity date of july  with terms substantially the same as the previous agreement 
we expect to renew our revolving credit agreement in july we do not anticipate that the current situation in the credit market will impact our renewal 
management believes projected cash flows from operations and our bank revolving credit facility or comparable financing will provide us the necessary liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
the belief that we will have the necessary liquidity and capital resources is based upon management s knowledge of the hvac industry and our place in that industry  our ability to limit our growth if necessary  our ability to adjust dividend cash payments  and our relationship with our existing bank lender 
for information concerning our revolving credit facility at december   see note  revolving credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities has fluctuated from year to year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily from changes in net income  accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as described below 
net income for was million  a decrease of million from million in the decrease in net income in from was primarily due to lower volume of sales which was a result of the current economic environment and lower sales from our canadian operations offset by lower material costs  improved production and labor efficiencies  a reduction in manufacturing related expenses and a million million net of tax unrealized gain from a derivative asset 
the increase in net income in from was primarily due to increased volume of sales  adjusted pricing strategies  fluctuations in raw materials costs  innovative and efficient products and improved production efficiencies 
depreciation expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation is due to the realization of full depreciation of certain capital assets 
share based compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
both depreciation expense and share based compensation expense decreased net income  but had no effect on operating cash

cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities in did not significantly fluctuate from and were related to manufacturing and equipment purchases and costs to expand our manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities in from was primarily related to lower capital expenditures 
management utilizes cash flows provided from operating activities to fund capital expenditures that are expected to increase growth and create efficiencies 
we expect to expend approximately million in for renovation of the previously leased facility and equipment 
we expect the cash requirements to be provided by cash flows from operations 
we did not invest in any certificates of deposits in  or in january  we invested million with a large financial institution 
the investments were allocated to cash and money market funds  mutual funds  certificates of deposit  corporate notes and bonds and foreign corporate notes and bonds with a maturity of one year or less 
cash flows used in financing activities

the decrease in cash flows used in financing activities of million in from is primarily related to a lower volume of stock repurchases 
the increase in cash flows used in financing activities in from was primarily related to cash dividends declared and paid and the continued repurchase of our stock 
we occasionally utilize our revolving line of credit to meet certain short term cash demands based on our liquidity at the time

the applicable share and per share data for included herein has been restated to reflect the stock split 
the board of directors approved future dividend payments of per share on may  board approval is required to determine the date of declaration and amount for each semi annual dividend payment 
cash dividend payments of million were made in  and we accrued a liability for payment of million of dividends in january cash dividend payments of million were made in  and million in dividends were declared and accrued as a liability in december for payment in january cash dividend payments of million were made in  and million in dividends were declared and accrued as a liability in december for payment in january commitments and contractual agreements the following table summarizes our long term debt and other contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term capital leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations consist primarily of copper and aluminum commitments 
we are a party to several short term  cancelable and noncancelable  fixed price contracts with major suppliers from our fixed price contracts for the purchase of raw material and component parts 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments because they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
the fixed rate interest on long term capital leases includes the amount of interest due on our fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts do not include interest on our variable rate obligation related to the revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment  future actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions on a monthly basis 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of estimation or assumption revenue recognition we recognize revenues from sales of products when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual agreements 
sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experiences and current estimates 
for sales initiated by independent manufacturer representatives  we recognize revenues net of the representatives commission 
our policy is to record the collection and payment of sales taxes through a liability account 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends in collections and write offs  current customer status  the age of the receivable  economic conditions and other information 
aged receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if the reserve is adequate and adjusted accordingly at that time 
the evaluation of these factors involves complex  subjective judgments 
thus  changes in these factors or changes in economic circumstances may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves we establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes  the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions  the required parts needed for part supply sales  replacement parts and for estimated shrinkage 
warranty a provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the warranty period is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  and years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable 
warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period  historical warranty trends and associated costs  and any known identifiable warranty issue 
warranty charges associated with heat exchangers do not occur frequently 
due to the absence of warranty history on new products  an additional provision may be made for such products 
our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required 
medical insurance a provision is made for medical costs associated with our medical employee benefit plan  which is primarily a self funded plan 
a provision is made for estimated medical costs based on historical claims paid and potential significant future claims 
the plan is supplemented by employee contributions and an excess policy for claims over  each 
stock compensation we account for equity based compensation in accordance with fasc topic  compensation stock compensation 
applying this standard to value equity based compensation requires us to use significant judgment and to make estimates  particularly for the assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model  such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as for the expected option forfeiture rates 
we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments using the black scholes valuation model to calculate the grant date fair value of the award 
the compensation cost is recognized over the period of time during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which will be the vesting period 
derivatives we use derivatives to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
fluctuations in copper commodity prices impact the value of the derivatives that we hold 
we are subject to gains which we record as derivative assets if the forward copper commodity prices increase and losses which we record as derivative liabilities if they decrease 
we record the fair value of the derivative position in the consolidated balance sheets 
we use comex index pricing to support our fair value calculation  which is a level input per the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is for instruments similar but not identical to the contract we will settle 
we did not designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
we record changes in the derivative s fair value currently in earnings based on mark to market accounting 
the change in earnings is recorded to cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
historically  actual results have been within management s expectations 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued fasc topic  derivatives and hedging  formerly sfas no 
 fasc  which requires enhanced disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under prior guidance and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
fasc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  adoption of fasc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  topic generally accepted accounting principles gaap asu  which superseded all accounting standards in us gaap  aside from those issued by the sec 
the codification does not change or alter existing gaap 
asu is effective for reporting periods ending after september  we adopted asu for reporting in the third quarter of adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement and disclosures measuring liabilities at fair value asu  which provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance 
we adopted asu in the fourth quarter of adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  subsequent events asu  which discontinues the requirement that entities disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events 
asu is effective upon issuance 
we adopted asu for reporting in the fourth quarter of adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  will  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date on which they are made 
we undertake no obligations to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include the timing and extent of changes in raw material and component prices  the effects of fluctuations in the commercial industrial new construction market  the timing and extent of changes in interest rates  as well as other competitive factors during the year  and general economic  market or business conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility  which bears variable interest based upon the greater of a rate of or libor plus 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign sales accounted for less than approximately of our sales in and we accept payment for such sales in us and canadian dollars  therefore  we believe we are not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risk on these sales 
we believe our foreign currency exchange rate risk has diminished due to the closure of our manufacturing operations in canada in september foreign currency transactions and financial statements are translated in accordance with fasc topic  foreign currency matters 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency  except for the canadian subsidiaries  which use the canadian dollar 
adjustments arising from translation of the canadian subsidiaries financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
transaction gains or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations applicable to transactions denominated in canadian currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar was  and at december   and  respectively 
commodity price risk we entered into a derivative instrument in the third quarter of with a large financial institution to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
we monitor our derivative and the credit worthiness of the financial institution 
we do not anticipate losses due to counterparty non performance 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
fluctuations in copper commodity prices impact the value of the derivative we hold 
we are subject to gains which we record as derivative assets if the forward copper commodity prices increase and losses which we record as derivative liabilities if they decrease 
at december   the forward copper commodity prices were higher than our contract price resulting in a gain on derivative assets 
the fair value of the derivative settlements from january through december is million and recognized as current derivative assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
we use comex index pricing to support our fair value calculation  which is a level input per the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is for instruments similar but not identical to the contract we will settle 
we did not designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
we record changes in the derivative s fair value currently in earnings based on mark to market accounting 
as of december   we recorded a million million net of tax adjustment to cost of sales from the unrealized gain on derivative assets at fair value in the consolidated statements of income 
information about our exposure to market risks related to forward copper commodity prices and a sensitivity analysis related to our derivative is presented below december  in thousands notional amount  pounds carrying amount and fair value of assets fair value with a decrease in forward copper commodity prices fair value with a decrease in forward copper commodity prices the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during and due to the economic environment 
prices decreased by approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from december  to december  we have entered into contracts that are below the average index price as of december  the lower commodity prices have contributed to our lower cost of goods sold and higher gross margins 
we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition to the derivative instrument described above  we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do use derivatives to economically hedge our commodity price risk
