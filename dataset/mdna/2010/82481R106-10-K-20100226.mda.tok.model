in many cases  however  the company s products have more than one patent pertaining to them 
in such cases  or where the company enjoys trade secrets  manufacturing expertise  patient preference or regulatory exclusivity  the company may continue to market its own products without its commercial sales of those products being adversely affected by the loss of any given patent 

table of contents competition shire believes that competition in its markets is based on  among other things  product safety  efficacy  convenience of dosing  reliability  availability and price 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures than shire have a greater ability to fund the research and clinical trials necessary for regulatory applications  and consequently may have a better chance of obtaining approval of drugs that would then compete with shire s products 
other products now in use or being developed by others may be more effective or have fewer side effects than the company s current or future products

table of contents government regulation the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of shire s products are subject to governmental regulation in the us  the eu and other territories 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the prescription drug marketing act and the public health service act in the us  and numerous directives and guidelines in the eu  govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of the company s products 
product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks take a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
in general  for a new chemical entity  the product needs to undergo rigorous preclinical testing 
clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
in phase  the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical compound into healthy human volunteers  the emphasis is on testing for safety adverse effects  dosage tolerance  metabolism  distribution  excretion and clinical pharmacology 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the pharmaceutical compound for specific targeted indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks 
once a compound is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluations  phase trials are undertaken with a larger number of patients to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficiency and safety of the product and to evaluate more fully clinical outcomes 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the quality  safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
in order to gain marketing approval the company must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality chemistry  manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product as well as the non clinical and clinical data 
the fda undertakes the review for the us 
in the eu the review may be undertaken by the following i members of the emea s committee for medicinal products for human use chmp as part of a centralized procedure  ii an individual country s regulatory agency  followed by mutual recognition of this review by a number of other countries agencies  depending on the process applicable to the drug in question  or iii a competent member state s regulatory agency through a decentralized procedure  an alternative authorization procedure to the mutual recognition procedure for those drugs that are ineligible for a centralized review 
approval can take from several months to several years  or be denied 
the approval process can be affected by a number of factors for example additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs 
as a condition of approval  the regulatory agency will require post marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects  and may require other additional studies as deemed appropriate 
after approval for the initial indication  further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications 
the terms of any approval  including labeling content  may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product 
as a condition of approval  the regulatory agency will require that the product continue to meet regulatory requirements as to quality  safety and efficacy and will require strict procedures to monitor and report any adverse effects 
where adverse effects occur or may occur  the regulatory agency may require additional studies or changes to the labeling 
compelling new adverse data may result in a product approval being withdrawn at any stage following review by an agency and discussion with the company 
some jurisdictions  including the eu and the us  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
generally  if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that applications to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to ten years in the eu and for up to seven years in the us 
these laws are particularly pertinent to shire s hgt business unit 
in the us  the drug price competition and patent restoration term act of  known as the us hatch waxman act  established a period of marketing exclusivity for brand name drugs as well as abbreviated application procedures for generic versions of those drugs 
approval to manufacture these drugs is sought by filing an anda 
as a substitute for conducting full scale pre clinical and clinical studies  the fda can accept data establishing that the drug formulation  which is the subject of an abbreviated application  is bio equivalent and has the same therapeutic effect as the previously approved drug  among other requirements 
eu legislation also contains data exclusivity provisions 
all products will be subject to an exclusivity regime 
a generic company may file a marketing authorization application for that product with the health authorities referencing the innovator s data eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product 
the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either ten or eleven years have elapsed from the date of grant of the initial marketing authorization 
the one year extension is available if the innovator obtains an additional indication during the first eight years of the marketing authorization that is of significant advancement in clinical benefit 

table of contents in the us  the dea also regulates the national production and distribution of scheduled drugs ie those drugs containing controlled substances by allocating production quotas based  in part  upon the dea s view of national demand 
as schedule ii drugs  the production and distribution of shire s adhd products are strictly controlled 
the branch of the fda responsible for drug marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved products 
shire is also subject to various us federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where the company operates 
regulatory developments in the us various legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems 
some states have passed such legislation  and further federal and state proposals are possible 
such proposals and legislation include  and future proposals could include  price controls  patient access constraints to medicines and increases in required rebates or discounts 
similar issues exist in the eu 
the company cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives  but will work to maintain patient access to its products and to oppose price constraints 
additionally  legislation is being debated at the federal level in the us that could allow patient access to drugs approved in other countries most notably canada 
this is generally referred to as drug re importation 
although there is substantial opposition to this potential legislation within areas of the federal government  including the fda  the company cannot predict the outcome of such legislative activities 
additionally  us federal and state proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicaid program 
us law requires the company to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program 
rebates potentially could be viewed as price discounts without appreciable increases in shire s product sales volume as an offset 
the company must also give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
in september the food and drug administration amendments act of was signed into law 
it contains a wide range of changes affecting the pharmaceutical industry covering issues relating to fees associated with application approval  drug safety and risk management  direct to consumer advertising  clinical trial and clinical trial result disclosure 
similar regulatory and legislative issues are encountered in europe and other international markets where governments regulate pharmaceutical prices and patient reimbursement levels 
the differing approach to price regulation has led to some parallel trade within the eu where shire s products are imported into markets with higher prices from markets with lower prices 
exploitation of price differences between countries in this way can impact sales in those markets with higher prices 
third party reimbursement and pricing the company s revenue depends  in part  upon the price third parties  such as health care providers and governmental organizations are willing to reimburse patients and physicians for the cost of the company s products or the company s competitors similar products and related treatment 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products and or seeking pharmaco economic data to justify their negotiated reimbursement prices 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of established a voluntary drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries and created the new medicare part d and medicare part b 
medicare part d gives elderly and disabled people  already on medicare  access to subsidized prescription drug coverage from january onwards 
medicare part b establishes new rules to lower medicare s reimbursement rate for physician administered drugs 
it is difficult to predict the long term impact of this expansion of medicare on pharmaceutical companies 
usage of pharmaceutical products may increase as the result of expanded access to medications afforded by partial reimbursement under medicare 
however  such potential sales increases may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to enhanced purchasing power of the private sector that will negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries 
in the us  several factors outside shire s control could significantly influence the sale price of pharmaceutical products  including the continued push for major healthcare reform in the us and the uncertainty that entails for pharmaceutical companies  medicare part d prescription drug plans  new medicare part b reimbursement rules  the increase in states seeking supplemental medicaid rebates  the ongoing trend toward managed healthcare  and the renewed focus on reducing costs and reimbursement rates in medicaid  medicare and other government insurance programs 

table of contents similar developments may take place in the eu markets  where the emphasis will likely be on national price controls and non reimbursement for new and highly priced medicines for which the economic as well as the therapeutic rationales are not yet established 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products in the eu 
limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce the demand for the company s products 
price applications in europe must be conducted on a country by country basis 
the slow pace of the process in some countries have delayed launches of products otherwise approved for up to two years and  in occasional situations  prevented launch 
as a consequence the company s estimated dates for product launches may be subject to change 
corporate responsibility the company continues to develop its approach to corporate responsibility  the shire responsibility co ordination team the team comprises representatives from  among others  r d  hr  environment health safety  compliance risk management  facilities  marketing and corporate communications

table of contents item a risk factors the company has adopted a risk management strategy designed to identify  assess and manage the significant risks that it faces 
while the company aims to identify and manage such risks  no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss 
set out below are the key risk factors  associated with the business  that have been identified through the company s approach to risk management 
some of these risk factors are specific to the company  and others are more generally applicable to the pharmaceutical industry in which the company operates 
the company considers that these risk factors apply equally and therefore all should be carefully considered before any investment is made in shire 
risk factors related to the company s business the company s key products may not be a commercial success the commercial success of the company s key products elaprase  vyvanse  lialda mezavant  pentasa  fosrenol  replagal  intuniv  as well as other new products that the company may launch in the future  including vpriv  will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians  patients and other key decision makers  as well as the timing of the receipt of additional marketing approvals  the scope of marketing approvals as reflected in the product s label  the countries in which such approvals are obtained  the authorization of price and reimbursement in those countries where price and reimbursement is negotiated  and safety  efficacy  convenience and cost effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products 
the company may not be able to grow its product revenues as quickly as anticipated if any or all of the following occur if competitive products are genericized or if the prices of competitor products are otherwise reduced significantly  the prescribing of treatments for the indications that the company s products treat could be adversely affected  if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the company s products not seen in clinical trials that impact the physician s willingness to prescribe the company s products  if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post marketing purposes or for registration in another country or if regulatory agencies in one country act in a way that raises concerns for regulatory agencies or for prescribers or patients in another country  if patients  payors or physicians favor other treatments over the company s products  if government regulation is stricter for the company s products than for other treatments  if the company s products suffer a loss of patent protection or competitors successfully challenge or circumvent the company s patents or regulatory exclusivity see item legal proceedings and note d  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements listed under item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report for details of current patent litigation  if planned geographical expansion into emerging markets is not successful  or if the size of the patient populations for the company s products are less than expected or the company fails to identify new patients for its products 
if the company is unable to commercialize any of its key products successfully  there may be a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company derives significant revenues and earnings from mature portfolio products whether or not promoted including carbatrol  daytrana  calcichew  reminyl and xagrid 
sales of these products could decrease as a result of any or all of the following if competitive products are genericized or if the prices of competitor products are otherwise reduced significantly  the prescribing of treatments for the indications that the company s products treat could be adversely affected  if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the company s products not seen in clinical trials that impact the physician s willingness to prescribe the company s products  if patients  payers or physicians favor other treatments over the company s products  if the company s products suffer a loss of patent protection or competitors successfully challenge or circumvent the company s patents or regulatory exclusivity see item legal proceedings and note d  commitments 
table of contents and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements listed under item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report for details of current patent litigation  and decreased consumer demand or acceptance 
unanticipated decreases in revenues from adderall xr could significantly reduce the company s revenues and earnings 
in the year ended december  sales of adderall xr were  million  representing approximately of the company s total revenues 
in the year to december  sales of adderall xr declined to million  representing approximately of the company s total revenues 
this decline resulted directly from the launch by teva and impax of authorized generic versions of adderall xr in april and october  respectively 
the company sells the authorized generic version of adderall xr to teva and impax and currently receives royalties from impax on the sale of its authorized generic 
shire continues to sell the branded version of adderall xr 
factors that could negatively impact total revenue from adderall xr include  but are not limited to faster than anticipated erosion of adderall xr sales and elimination of the impax royalty as a result of fda approval of additional generic competitors  issues impacting the production of adderall xr or the supply of amphetamine salts including  but not limited to  the ability to get sufficient quota from the us dea  changes in reimbursement policies of third party payers  changes to the level of sales deductions for adderall xr for private or public payers  and if the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms disagree with the company s interpretation as to how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation and require the company to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation 
for further details  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any decrease in royalties derived from the sales of tc and zeffix could significantly reduce earnings the company receives royalties from gsk on the worldwide sales of tc and zeffix 
in  the company s royalty income relating to tc and zeffix sales was million million  million 
any factors that decrease sales of tc and zeffix by gsk could significantly reduce the company s royalty revenue  and results of operations 
these include loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents see item legal proceedings and note d  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements listed under item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report for details of current patent litigation  reduction in the production of tc and zeffix  technological advances  government action intervention  public opinion towards aids treatments  and product liability claims 
the failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement  or an adequate level of reimbursement  by third party payers in a timely manner for the company s products may impact future revenues and earnings the company s revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the company by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products 
changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the reimbursement of treatment established by health care providers  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this  in turn  could impact on the prices at which the company can sell its products 
the market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following  which could result in lower prices for the company s products and or a reduced demand for the company s products 
table of contents the ongoing trend toward managed health care  particularly in the us  legislative proposals to reform health care and government insurance programs in many of the company s markets  and price controls and non reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established 
the prices for certain of the company s products when commercialized  in particular products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as replagal  elaprase and vpriv  may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products 
the company may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for its products  particularly those with a high cost of treatment 
the failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a disruption to the product supply chain may result in the company being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the company being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis the company sources its products from third party contract manufacturers  and for certain products has its own manufacturing capability 
in the event of either the company s failure or the failure of any third party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as current good manufacturing standards or cgmp in the countries in which the company sells or intends to sell or have its products sold  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products 
the company dual sources certain key products and or active ingredients 
however  the company currently relies on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of daytrana  firazyr  lialda mezavant  pentasa  reminyl and xagrid and relies on a single active ingredient source for each of elaprase  firazyr  fosrenol  reminyl  replagal and xagrid 
in the event of financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer or the failure of the third party manufacturer to comply with its contractual obligations  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products 
this could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms  or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements 
the company is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements the development and approval of the company s products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities 
as the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications  regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval 
the need to qualify a new supplier could delay the company s development and commercialization efforts 
the company uses bovine derived serum sourced from new zealand and north america in the manufacturing process for elaprase 
the discovery of additional cattle in north america or the discovery of cattle in new zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or mad cow disease  could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products  or prohibit the company from using these products at all in such countries 
the actions of certain customers can affect the company s ability to sell or market products profitably  as well as impact net sales and growth comparisons a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the us and certain european markets 
in  for example  approximately of the company s product sales were attributable to two customers in the us  mckesson corp 
and cardinal health  inc in the event of financial failure of any of these customers  the company may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues and earnings 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred 
consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels  or otherwise reduce purchases of the company s products 
such actions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s specialty pharmaceuticals product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the us and europe 
consequently  product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions  or other factors 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s 
table of contents revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers 
changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to the company s activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in the distraction of senior management  significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines the company engages in various marketing  promotional and educational activities pertaining to  as well as the sale of  pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world 
the promotion  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and the operations of market participants  such as the company  are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  including the fda  the us department of justice and the dea in the us 
any inquiries or investigations into the operations of  or enforcement or other regulatory action against  the company by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time  significant defence costs  substantial monetary penalties and require extensive government monitoring of company activities in the future 
as an example on september  the company received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of inspector general in coordination with the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  seeking production of documents related to the sales and marketing of adderall xr  daytrana and vyvanse 
shire is cooperating and responding to this subpoena 
the outsourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third parties  the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the company s business and to develop and market products the company has entered into many agreements with third parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business 
if the third party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis  the company may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis 
additionally  it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers 
the company has also entered into licensing and co development agreements with a number of parties 
there is a risk that  upon expiration or termination of a third party agreement  the company may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party as commercial interests may no longer coincide 
in such circumstances  the company may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line 
risk factors related to the pharmaceutical industry in general the actions of governments  industry regulators and the economic environments in which the company operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry  in any country in which the company conducts its business  may adversely impact the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation 
the introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are large  well known pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications 
they may also be more successful than the company in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization 
if any product that competes with one of the company s principal drugs is approved  the company s sales of that drug could fall 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change 
the company s products could  therefore  be rendered obsolete or uneconomic  through the development of new products  technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain and requires significant expenditures and time products that appear promising in research or development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development or the market for several reasons  including 
table of contents preclinical or clinical tests may show the product to lack safety or efficacy  delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies  additional clinical supplies requirements  extended length of time to achieve study endpoints  additional time requirements for data analysis or dossier preparation  discussions with regulatory agencies  including regulatory agency requests for additional preclinical or clinical data  delays at regulatory agencies due to staffing or resource limitations  analysis of or changes to study design  unexpected safety  efficacy  or manufacturing issues 
delays may arise from shared control with collaborative partners in the planning and execution of the product development  scaling of the manufacturing process  or getting approval for manufacturing  manufacturing issues  pricing  reimbursement issues  or other factors may render the product economically unviable  the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent the product from being developed or commercialized  and failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals 
success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large scale clinical trials will be successful 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approvals 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict 
if the company s large scale or late state clinical trials for a product are not successful  the company will not recover its substantial investments in that product 
in addition  even if the products receive regulatory approval  they remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements  including  for example  obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other non clinical testing  changes to the product label  new or revised requirements for manufacturing  written notifications to physicians  or product recalls or withdrawals 
further  a number of the company s products that treat adhd contain controlled substances and are subject to regulation by the us dea and equivalent agencies in other countries 
the failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue the company enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing 
in these partnerships  the company is sometimes dependent on its partner to deliver results 
while these partnerships are supported by contracts  the company may not exercise direct control 
if a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties  the company may suffer a delay in the development  a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product 
the failure to secure new products or compounds for development  either through in licensing  acquisition or internal research and development efforts  may have an adverse impact on the company s future results the company s future results will depend  to a significant extent  upon its ability to in license  acquire or develop new products or compounds 
the company also expends significant resources on research and development 
the failure to in license or acquire new products or compounds  on a commercially viable basis  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may fail to obtain  maintain  enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business the company s success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights 
where possible  the company s strategy is to register intellectual property rights  such as patents and trademarks 
the company also relies variously on trade secrets  unpatented know how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain its competitive position 
patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the company have been granted  or are pending in various countries  including the us  canada  major european countries and japan 
the company intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the company 
however  patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing  using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company s products or technologies 
the company s patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed 
table of contents or withdrawn 
the company cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the company s products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged  revoked  invalidated  infringed or circumvented by third parties 
in the regular course of business  the company is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
see item legal proceedings and note d  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements listed under item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report for details of current patent litigation 
additionally  the company s products  or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now  or in the future  infringe the patent rights of third parties 
it is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development  manufacture or sale of the company s products 
if third parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology  it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the company or its strategic partners from developing  manufacturing or selling its products 
the company may need to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others to develop  manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other un patented proprietary information  which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants  advisors and partners 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
if the company s employees  scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the company s products under development  such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the company s property  but may remain the property of those persons or their employers 
protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the company s proprietary rights 
the failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the company s product sales 
the company has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the us and countries in europe and latin america and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed 
in addition  with respect to certain products  the company relies on the trademarks of third parties 
these trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the company or the third parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks 
the company s inability or the inability of these third parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the company s trademarks and dilute their value 
if a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects  this could result in damage to the company s reputation  the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the company unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity from complaints concerning any of the company s products  or those of its competitors  could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims  product recalls  litigation and associated adverse publicity 
the cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited 
a successful product liability claim against the company could require the company to pay a substantial monetary award 
if  in the absence of adequate insurance coverage  the company does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim  it could become insolvent 
product liability insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
although the company carries product liability insurance when available  this coverage may not be adequate 
in addition  it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available 
moreover  an adverse judgment in a product liability suit  even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal  could generate substantial negative publicity about the company s products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products 
loss of highly qualified management and scientific personnel could cause the company subsequent financial loss the company faces competition for highly qualified management and scientific personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
it may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel 
the company has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less 
the loss of such personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect on the company s business

it is intended that the first interim payment each year should be the higher of the previous year s first interim usd dividend and the usd equivalent of the previous year s first gbp interim dividend 
dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the board when the second interim dividend is determined 
any dividend growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year 
income access share arrangements ias trust shire has put into place the ias trust which enables shire ordinary shareholders  other than shire ads holders  to elect to receive their dividends either from a company resident for tax purposes in the republic of ireland or from a shire group company resident for tax purposes in the uk 
old shire has issued one income access share to the ias trust which is held by the income access share trustee 
the mechanics of the arrangements are as follows i if a dividend is announced or declared by shire plc on the shire ordinary shares  an amount is paid by old shire by way of a dividend on the income access share to the income access share trustee  and such amount is paid by the income access share trustee to the shire ordinary shareholders who have elected or are deemed to have elected to receive dividends under these arrangements 
the dividend which would otherwise be payable by shire to such shire ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to such shire ordinary shareholders by the income access share trustee 
ii if the dividend paid on the income access share and on paid by the income access share trustee to the shire ordinary shareholders is less than the total amount of the dividend announced or declared by shire on the shire ordinary shares  shire will be obliged to pay a dividend on the shire ordinary shares equivalent to the amount of the shortfall 
in such a case  any dividend paid on the shire ordinary shares will generally be subject to irish withholding tax at the rate of or such lower rate as may be applicable under exemptions from withholding tax contained in irish law 
iii a shire ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access share election such that he will receive his dividends which would otherwise be payable by shire under these arrangements from old shire 
iv a shire ordinary shareholder who holds  or fewer shire ordinary shares at the first record date after he first becomes a shire ordinary shareholder  and who does not make a contrary election  will be deemed to have made an election pursuant to the shire articles of association such that he will receive his dividends under these arrangements from old shire 
the ads depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders of shire adss such that they will receive dividends from old shire under the income access share arrangements 
dividends paid by old shire under the income access share arrangements will not  under current legislation  be subject to any uk or irish withholding taxes 
if a holder of shire adss does not wish to receive dividends from old shire under the income access share arrangements  he must withdraw his shire ordinary shares from the shire ads program prior to the dividend record date set by the depositary and request 
table of contents delivery of the shire ordinary shares 
this will enable him to receive dividends from shire if necessary  by making an election to that effect 
it is the expectation  although there can be no certainty  that old shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to the income access share trustee for the benefit of all shire ordinary shareholders who make or are deemed to make an income access share election in an amount equal to what would have been such shire ordinary shareholders entitlement to dividends from shire in the absence of the income access share election 
if any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to the shire ordinary shareholders is less than such ordinary shareholders entitlement to dividends from shire in the absence of the income access share election  the dividend on the income access share will be allocated pro rata among the shire ordinary shareholders and shire will pay the balance to these shire ordinary shareholders by way of dividend 
in such circumstances  there will be no grossing up by shire in respect of  and old shire and shire will not compensate those shire ordinary shareholders for  any adverse consequences including any irish withholding tax consequences 
shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements at any time  in which case the full shire dividend will be paid directly by shire to those shire ordinary shareholders including the depositary who have made or are deemed to have made an income access share election 
in such circumstances  there will be no grossing up by shire in respect of  and old shire and shire will not compensate those shire ordinary shareholders for  any adverse consequences including any irish withholding tax consequences 
in the year ended december  old shire paid dividends totaling million million on the income access share to the income access share trustee in an amount equal to the dividend shire ordinary shareholders would have received from shire 
distributable reserves the payment of dividends by shire plc is governed by jersey law 
under jersey law  shire plc is entitled to make payments of dividends from its accumulated profits and other distributable reserves 
prior to making any dividend payment  the directors of shire plc who authorize the payment of the dividend must make a solvency statement to the effect that shire plc will be able to continue to carry on its business and discharge its debts as they fall due immediately after the payment is made and for the twelve month period following the making of the payment 
shire plc s future dividend policy will be dependent upon the amount of its distributable reserves  its financial condition  the terms of its then existing debt facilities and other relevant factors existing at the time 
for dividends paid by old shire on the income access share to the income access share trustee  the ability of old shire to pay dividends is determined under english law 
as a matter of english law old shire can only pay dividends out of its distributable profits  which are the accumulated realized profits of old shire and not the consolidated group  so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization  less accumulated realized losses  so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
overview shire s mission is to be the most valuable specialty biopharmaceutical company in the world that focuses on enabling people with life altering conditions to lead better lives 
shire focuses its business on adhd  hgt and gi diseases as well as opportunities in other therapeutic areas to the extent they arise through acquisitions 
shire s in licensing  merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection and global rights 
shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and requiring relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures and net assets are attributable to the development  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two reporting segments specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt 
the company also earns royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties which are recorded as revenues 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which within specialty pharmaceuticals and within hgt  and of total revenues are derived from royalties 
shire s strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach 
strategic and operational objectives are set at the corporate level and cascaded to the segment specialty pharmaceuticals hgt  therapeutic area and functional levels so that these objectives are aligned with the corporate objectives 
the company therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management and uses key performance indicators kpis to measure the achievement of these objectives 
for  shire s corporate kpis included certain financial and non financial measures 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increased r d costs as development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  governments and healthcare systems favoring earlier entry of low cost generic drugs  and higher marketing costs due to competition for market share 
shire s strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets historically  shire s portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the north american market 
the acquisition in of tkt and the consequent establishment of our hgt business and the acquisition of equasym in which facilitated immediate access to the european adhd market provided shire with the platforms to increase its presence in europe and row  thereby working towards diversifying the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market 
in the hgt business derived more than of its revenues from outside of the us 
in addition to the marketed products and products in development obtained through the acquisition of tkt elaprase  replagal and vpriv  shire has made significant progress on a path to geographic diversification with additional development and commercialization activities in  including continued roll out of elaprase in certain latin american and row countries  continued roll out of mezavant  fosrenol and firazyr in europe  and the entering into a licensing arrangement for lialda mezavant in japan 

table of contents shire s long term mission is to increase the proportion of its product sales from outside of the us and outside of the us  uk  germany  france  italy  spain and canada by shire has late stage development activities ongoing which are expected to further supplement the diversification of revenues in the future  including vyvanse launches in canada and latin american countries and the registration program for approval in the eu  vpriv launches in the eu and certain latin american countries  the continued roll out of firazyr in certain european and latin american countries  lialda mezavant diverticulitis registration program  and the continued roll out of fosrenol  lialda mezavant and equasym in eu and row countries 
r d over the last five years shire has focused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas  which meet the needs of the specialist physician  and has concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later stage pipeline products within these core therapeutic areas 
evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the company s development pipeline over the last five years 
since january  several products have received regulatory approval  in the us  daytrana and elaprase in  lialda and vyvanse in  and intuniv in  in the eu  fosrenol in  elaprase and mezavant in the company had vpriv in registration in the us and eu and filed a bla for replagal in the us at december  in february  shire withdrew its december bla filing for replagal and at the suggestion of the fda  requested and received fast track designation 
shire immediately initiated a rolling bla submission in february 
shire s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
r d costs in will include expenditure on several pre clinical to phase studies for products in development and phase b and phase studies to support recently launched products in the specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt businesses  together with the development of new projects in both the specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt businesses 
for a discussion of the company s current development projects see item business 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations as generic manufacturers may enter the market 
generic manufacturers often do not need to complete extensive clinical studies when they seek registration of a copy product and accordingly  they are generally able to sell the company s drugs at a much lower price 
as expected  in teva and impax commenced commercial shipments of their authorized generic versions of adderall xr 
during the year to december  the company s sales of adderall xr declined by to million  representing of total revenues in 
as discussed in item business  the fda has not yet reached a decision on the citizen s petition for adderall xr which was filed in october any fda decision which does not require generic follow on products to require bio equivalence or additional clinical testing could lead to additional generic competition for adderall xr 
shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its fosrenol and carbatrol patents  as well as the patents for certain other products 
during shire settled certain legal proceedings relating to adderall xr and carbatrol 
shire has also intervened in a lawsuit brought by actavis elizabeth llc against the fda concerning fda s decision to grant vyvanse new chemical entity regulatory exclusivity 
for more detail of current patent litigation  see item legal proceedings and note d  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements listed under item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report 
business development as a result of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or loss of data exclusivity  shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long term patent protection and or data exclusivity 
during  in addition to acquiring the worldwide rights excluding the us  canada and barbados to equasym ir and xl from ucb and entering into a research collaboration with santaris for the development of its lna drug platform technology  shire also acquired the remaining interests in jerini ag having acquired more than of the voting interests of jerini in 
in shire also acquired the global rights to metazym  a clinical candidate arylsulfatase a  from zymenex 
in the company acquired new river 
table of contents and through the new river acquisition obtained control of the commercialization of vyvanse 
organization and structure during  the company undertook a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement  establishing shire plc  a company incorporated in jersey channel islands as the new shire holding company 
for further details on the scheme of arrangement see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report 

table of contents results of operations for the years to december  and key financial highlights for the year to december  are as follows product sales excluding adderall xr increased by to  million  million following continued strong growth from vyvanse  lialda mezavant  elaprase and replagal  product sales including adderall xr decreased by to  million  million due to the expected decline in adderall xr products sales following the launch of authorized generic versions by teva and impax  with the strong performance in shire s other products offsetting the decrease  total revenues decreased marginally to  million in  million as the increase in product sales excluding adderall xr and royalty income received on teva and impax s sales of authorized generic adderall xr offset the decline in adderall xr product sales  operating income in increased by to million  million  and net income attributable to shire plc increased by million to million million and diluted earnings per ordinary share increased to c in c

further information about this litigation can be found in item legal proceedings and in note d  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements listed under item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report 
intuniv adhd intuniv was launched in the us in november in line with shire s revenue recognition policy for launch shipments  initial stocking shipments have been deferred and are being recognized into revenue in line with end user prescription demand 
at december  deferred revenues on the balance sheet represented gross sales of million 
adderall xr adhd the launch by teva and impax of their authorized generic versions of adderall xr led to the expected decline in of branded adderall xr prescription demand  and resulted in higher us sales deductions in compared to these factors more than offset the positive impacts of price increases taken since the fourth quarter of  and the inclusion in product sales of shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax in sales deductions represented of branded adderall xr gross sales in the year to december  compared to in the same period in  following higher medicaid and managed care rebates subsequent to the authorized generic launches 
as outlined in the critical accounting estimates section of this item  there are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to medicaid rebate legislation  including the deficit reduction act of medicaid rebate legislation 
as a result more than one unit rebate amount ura is calculable for the purpose of determining the company s medicaid rebate liability to states after the authorized generic launch 
during the company highlighted the different interpretations to the cms and submitted data to the cms for the purpose of computing the ura  based on the company s reasonable interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance 
the state medicaid agencies have invoiced the company for medicaid rebates  and the company has paid these medicaid rebate invoices  based on this ura 
despite this cms has the ability to subsequently challenge the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  and require an alternative interpretation to be applied both retrospectively and prospectively  which could result in a significantly higher medicaid liability 
throughout the company s management has recorded its accrual for medicaid rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable 
for the first three quarters of  the company s management based this best estimate on an amount that the company could pay were cms to challenge the company s interpretation and require an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation to be applied 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s management lowered its best estimate of the medicaid rebate payable down to be consistent with i the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  ii the company s repeated and consistent submission of price reporting to cms using the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  iii cms calculating the ura based on that interpretation  iv states submitting medicaid rebate invoices using this ura and v shire paying these invoices 
this change of estimate increased adderall xr product sales by million in the fourth quarter of of which million related to adderall xr product sales recognized in the first three quarters of 
in determining its best estimate of the medicaid rebate liability at december  the company s management has considered a number of factors taken in combination including the receipt of a further quarter s invoices from the states with a ura based on the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance  and the company s likely response were cms to employ an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation 
any future change in the company s interpretation which results in a change of estimate could significantly decrease sales of adderall xr in the period of any such change in estimate 
the company strongly believes that its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation is reasonable and correct 
however  cms could disagree with the company s interpretation  and require the company to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and pay up to million above the recorded liability 
this would 
table of contents represent a ura substantially in excess of the unit sales price of adderall xr and accordingly be in excess of the approximate amount of the full cost to the states of reimbursement for medicaid prescriptions of adderall xr

shire expects to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
v unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of million and million are included within payments due in less than one year and payments due in one to three years  respectively 
the contractual obligations table above does not include certain milestones and other contractual commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of events which are yet to occur and therefore payment is not yet due 
the most significant such milestone and contractual commitments are as follows i research collaboration with santaris on lna drug platform on august  shire announced that it had entered into a research collaboration with santaris  to develop its proprietary lna technology in a range of rare diseases 
lna technology has the benefit of shortened target validation and proof of concept  potentially increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development 
as part of the joint research project santaris will design  develop and deliver pre clinical lna oligonucleotides for shire selected orphan disease targets  and shire will have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis 
in the year to december  shire made an upfront payment of million to santaris  for technology access and r d funding  which has been expensed to r d 
shire has remaining obligations to pay santaris a further million subject to certain success criteria  and development and sales milestones up to a maximum of million for each indication 
shire will also pay single or double digit tiered royalties on net sales of the product 
shire and santaris have formed a joint research committee to monitor r d activities through preclinical lead candidate selection at which point all development and commercialization costs will be the responsibility of shire 
ii juvista on june  shire signed an agreement with renovo to develop and commercialize juvista  renovo s novel drug candidate being investigated for the reduction of scarring in connection with surgery 
renovo has commenced its first pivotal phase clinical trial in europe 
if the outcome from renovo s multi center  eu phase study is suitably positive  the data will be used to inform the strategy and design of shire s us development plan 
under the terms of the agreement  shire has the exclusive right to commercialize juvista worldwide  with the exception of the eu member states 
shire has remaining obligations to pay renovo million on the filing of juvista with the fda  up to million on fda approval  royalties on net sales of juvista  and up to million on the achievement of very significant sales targets 
shire will bear the cost of clinical trials designed specifically for obtaining us regulatory approval 
renovo will bear the costs of clinical trials designed specifically for obtaining eu regulatory approval 
shire and renovo will share equally the costs of conducting global clinical trials that are designed for obtaining both us and eu regulatory approvals 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
foreign currency fluctuations a number of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar  canadian dollar  pounds sterling and the euro 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences at december  of million are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and foreign 
table of contents exchange gains for the year to december  of million are reported in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   the company had outstanding swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency risk associated with intercompany transactions 
for further information  see item a to this annual report 
at december  the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments  trade accounts receivable from product sales and from third parties from which the company receives royalties and derivative contracts 
cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits 
the money market and liquidity funds in which shire invests are all triple a rated by both standard and poor s and by moody s credit rating agencies 
the company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments 
the company limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require counterparties to have a long term credit rating of a a or better from the major rating agencies 
the internal credit limits are approved by the board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function 
the counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international financial institutions 
the company s revenues from product sales are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were two customers in the us who accounted for of the company s product sales 
however  such customers typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered minimal 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of intangible assets  the valuation of equity investments  sales deductions  income taxes and provisions for litigation 
i valuation of intangible assets a estimation of amortization and impairment charges at december  the carrying value of intangible assets was  million  which primarily related to the company s daytrana million  equasym  million firazyr million  pentasa million  replagal million and vyvanse million products 
intangible assets that have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
ipr d assets  either acquired through business combinations which closed before january  or through asset acquisitions  which do not yet have a defined revenue stream  and for which no alternative future use exists  were expensed upon acquisition as a research and development expense 
ipr d assets acquired through business combinations which closed subsequent to january  have been capitalized as indefinite lived intangible assets  even if these assets do not have an alternative future use  subject to amortization on completion or impairment on abandonment of the relevant project 
at december  the carrying value of capitalized ipr d assets was million 
management s estimate of the useful life of its intangible assets considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit or extend the useful life  and the effects of demand  competition  including the launch of generic products  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
the company reviews the useful life of its 
table of contents intangible assets subject to amortization at each reporting period  and revises its estimate of the useful life if events or circumstances warrant 
any future changes to the useful life of the company s intangible assets could result in additional or lesser amortization expense in future periods which could materially affect operating results 
the company reviews its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
indefinite lived assets are reviewed for impairment through a one step test  which compares the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount  with an impairment loss recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for impairment  using a two step approach  whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
under step one  if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is considered impaired 
the impairment loss is determined under step two as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
events or circumstances that may suggest that its intangible assets may not be recoverable  and which would lead to the company evaluating its intangible assets for impairment  include the following changes to a product s commercialization strategy  the loss of patent protection  regulatory exclusivity or challenge or circumvention by competitors of the company s regulatory exclusivity patents  the development and marketing of competitive products  including generic entrants into the marketplace  changes to the product labels  or other regulatory intervention  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the company s products  a significant deterioration in a product s operating performance compared to expectations  and adverse changes to the technological or commercial viability of ipr d assets 
the occurrence of any such events could adversely affect the company s estimates of the future net cash flows generated by its intangible assets 
following the identification of such events and the resultant impairment reviews  the company recognized intangible asset impairment charges of nil in the year to december  million  of which million related to dynepo which the company stopped commercializing  million 
dependent on the occurrence of future events or circumstances  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected by impairment charges related to the recoverability of its long lived assets 
b intangible assets acquired through business combinations the fair values of all the identifiable intangible assets for commercialized products acquired through business combinations  primarily the acquisitions of tkt in  new river in and the acquisition of jerini in have been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
this method starts with a forecast of all expected future net cash flows which a market participant could have either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  customer relationships and other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying a market participant discount rate that reflects the risk factors that a market participant would associate with the cash flows to the extent the underlying cash flows have not similarly been risk adjusted 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made  including revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products including the estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration and estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  royalty or license fees saved by owning the intellectual property associated with the products  cost of sales for the products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  the estimated life of the products  and 
table of contents the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant purchasing the relevant assets piecemeal 
the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by the company s management and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows  and dependent on the outcome of future events or circumstances impairment charges as outlined at a above may result 
c valuation of ipr d acquired through business combinations ipr d represents the fair value assigned to incomplete technologies and development projects that the company has acquired through business combinations or asset acquisitions  which at the date of the relevant acquisition have not reached technological feasibility or have no alternative future use 
prior to january   the fair value ascribed to such technologies or development projects was immediately expensed to the consolidated statement of operations in the year of acquisition 
the company has recorded ipr d expense on the following significant business combinations that closed prior to january  million on acquisition of a majority voting interest in jerini in   million on acquisition of new river in  and million on acquisition of tkt in in the company also recorded ipr d charges of million following the asset acquisition of metazym from zymenex 
additionally  non refundable fees paid on the in licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use have been expensed and presented within r d expense 
for business combinations that closed subsequent to january  ipr d is required to be recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
during the year to december  the company has recorded ipr d assets of million  following the acquisition of equasym from ucb 
the company considers that a technology or development project has an alternative future use if it is probable that the company will use the asset in its current  incomplete state as it existed at the acquisition date  the asset will be used in another development project that has not yet commenced  and future economic benefit is expected from that use 
the company has determined that historically all such acquired development projects did not have an alternative future use 
the fair value of ipr d assets is determined using the income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d assets has been based on the present value of probability adjusted incremental cash flows which a market participant would expect to be generated by the ipr d projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these projects 
this method incorporates an evaluation of the risks associated with the development project  which include applying an appropriate discount rate commensurate with the project s stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions to be made revenue that is likely to result from specific ipr d projects  including the likelihood of approval of the product  estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  cost of sales related to the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other market data  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses to complete the development of the acquired products  and the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant purchasing the relevant assets piecemeal 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion of the acquired ipr d projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from ongoing clinical trials  and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
the use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the company could result in materially different asset values and ipr d expense 
however  as the valuation process for ipr d involves a number of inter relating assumptions  the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of the asset values or ipr d expense to changes in any individual assumption 
the valuation of ipr d has been based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition and utilized expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by shire s management  and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with such ipr d assets or expenses will occur as 
table of contents projected 
if certain of the ipr d projects fail during development  are abandoned  or do not receive the relevant regulatory approvals  the company may not realize the future cash flows that it has estimated nor recover the value of the r d investment made subsequent to acquisition 
if such circumstances occur  the company s future operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
ii valuation of equity investments at december  the carrying value of the company s investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies amounted to million  principally represented by the company s available for sale investment in vertex 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairment whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairment considered by the company  include  inter alia the market value of a quoted investment being below the cost of the investment  adverse news on a company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the investment s cost the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include the length of time and or the extent to which the market value of the investee is less than the cost of the investment  the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compounds  ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee  whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition and near term prospects of the investee 
in instances when this review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment of the company s investment in private companies  the company impairs the investment to its current fair value 
for the company s investments in public companies which are accounted for as available for sale securities  if these investments are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  any unrealized holding loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income by recording an other than temporary impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
during  and shire did not record any impairment charges for its non current investments in private companies 
during the year to december   the company recorded other than temporary impairment charges for its available for sale securities of million million  million  and at december  the company has unrealized holding gains on its available for sale securities of million 
at december  the company does not have any available for sale securities with unrealized holding losses 
other than temporary impairment charges recorded in included million for the company s investment in renovo group plc 
during the third quarter of  the company considered the following factors in its determination of whether its impairment in renovo group plc was temporary or other than temporary the severity of the decline from historical cost decline and its duration eleven months  market analysts targets of renovo group plc s share price for the next months  and the revised expected filing date for juvista due to the adoption of a sequential rather than parallel phase development plan 
these factors  together with the significant decline in global equity markets during the third quarter of meant that the company was unable to reasonably estimate the period over which a full recovery in the value of its investment in renovo group plc could occur 
as such  at the end of the third quarter of the company concluded that the decline in value was other than temporary 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized holding loss on a publicly quoted investment is other than temporary requires significant management judgment 
any future events or circumstances which could lead to the recognition of other than temporary impairment charges  particularly in respect of the company s investment in vertex carrying value at december  million  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents iii sales deductions sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  sales discounts including trade discounts and distribution service fees  wholesaler chargebacks  and allowances for coupon sampling programs 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
on the balance sheet the company records wholesaler chargebacks and prompt payment discounts as a reserve against accounts receivable  whereas all other sales deductions are recorded within current liabilities 
the company has the following significant categories of sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which the company considers to be critical accounting estimates  and require the company to use information from external sources medicaid and managed care rebates statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to managed care organizations mco under managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product if prices increase faster than inflation 
as it can take up to six months for information to reach the company on actual usage of the company s products in managed care and medicaid programs and on the total rebates to be reimbursed  the company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products 
the amount of the reserve is based on historical experience of rebates  the timing of payments  the level of reimbursement claims  changes in prices both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns  projected product returns and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
adjustments are made for known changes in these factors  such as how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to medicaid rebate legislation 
shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  results of independently commissioned retail inventory surveys and third party prescription data such as ims health national prescription audit data 
revisions or clarification of guidelines from the cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
the accrual estimation process for medicaid and managed care rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and medicaid agency or mco 
accordingly it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  with the exception of the estimation of the medicaid ura for adderall xr see below  shire does not believe that the effect of these uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to medicaid rebate legislation 
as a result more than one ura is calculable for the purpose of determining the company s medicaid rebate liability to states after authorized generic launch 
during the company highlighted the different interpretations to cms and submitted data to cms for the purpose of computing the ura  based on the company s reasonable interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance 
the state medicaid agencies have invoiced the company for medicaid rebates  and the company has paid these medicaid rebate invoices  based on this ura 
despite this cms has the ability to subsequently challenge the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  and require an alternative interpretation to be applied both retrospectively and prospectively  which could result in a significantly higher medicaid liability 
throughout the company s management has recorded its accrual for medicaid rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable 
the company s management has developed this best estimate considering a number factors in combination  including the level of ura invoiced by  and paid by the company to  the state medicaid agencies  the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  the company s correspondence with cms highlighting the potential different interpretations of the medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance  the likelihood of cms employing an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  an estimate of the amount the company could be required to pay were cms to employ an alternate interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  the company s willingness to initiate litigation to recover any additional amounts which may in the future be paid to cms  and the company s view of the ultimate outcome of any such litigation 

table of contents for the first three quarters of  the company s management based this best estimate on an amount that the company could pay were cms to challenge the company s interpretation and require an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation to be applied 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s management lowered its best estimate of the medicaid rebate payable down to be consistent with i the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  ii the company s repeated and consistent submission of price reporting to cms using the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  iii cms calculating the ura based on that interpretation  iv states submitting medicaid rebate invoices using this ura and v shire paying these invoices 
this change of estimate increased adderall xr product sales by million in the fourth quarter of of which million related to adderall xr product sales recognized in the first three quarters of 
in determining its best estimate of the medicaid rebate liability at december  the company s management has considered a number of factors taken in combination including the receipt of a further quarter s invoices from the states with a ura based on the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and related guidance  and the company s likely response were cms to employ an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation 
any future change in the company s interpretation which results in a change of estimate both retrospectively and prospectively could significantly decrease adderall xr product sales  which could have significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations in the period of any such change in estimate 
at december  the company has recorded an adderall xr medicaid liability of million 
the company strongly believes that its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation is reasonable and correct 
however  cms could disagree with the company s interpretation  and require the company to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and pay up to million above the recorded liability 
this would represent a ura substantially in excess of the unit sales price of adderall xr and accordingly be in excess of the approximate amount of the full cost to the states of reimbursement for medicaid prescriptions of adderall xr 
should cms take such an approach  the company could seek to limit any additional payments to a level approximating the full  un rebated cost to the states of adderall xr  or million above the recorded liability 
further  the company believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  and that there would be a strong basis to initiate litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of its recorded liability 
the result of any such litigation cannot be predicted and could result in additional rebate liability above the company s current best estimate 
aggregate accruals for medicaid and mco rebates at december   and were million  million and million  or  and respectively  of net product sales 
historically  with the exception of adderall xr noted above  actual rebates have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
product returns the company typically accepts customer product returns in the following circumstances a expiration of shelf life  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  c under sales terms that allow for unconditional return guaranteed sales  or d following product recalls or product withdrawals 
returns are generally accepted up to one year after expiration date of the relevant product 
the company typically refunds the agreed proportion of the sales price by the issuance of a credit  rather than cash refund or exchanges from inventory  and the returned product is destroyed 
shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors  including past product returns activity  the duration of time taken for products to be returned  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel  product recalls and discontinuances  the shelf life of products  the launch of new drugs or new formulations  and the loss of patent protection or new competition 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  third party prescription data and  for some product return provisions  market research of retail pharmacies 
returns reserves for new products generally require a higher level of estimation than estimates for established products 
for shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new product which can include guaranteed sales the company s policy is to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end patient acceptance of the new product primarily through third party prescription data 
for shipments after launch under standard terms ie  not guaranteed sales  the company s initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after launch 
once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the product 
table of contents are available  the returns provision is based on this data and any other relevant factors as noted above 
in the year to december  the company launched intuniv  for the treatment of adhd in children and adolescents in the us 
the company recognized revenue of million in and at december  had recorded deferred revenue on the balance sheet representing gross sales of million relating to launch shipments of intuniv 
the accrual estimation process for product returns involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and customer 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at the balance sheet date  provisions for product returns were million in  million in and million in  or  and  respectively  of net product sales 
historically  actual returns have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
iv income taxes in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  management is required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements  based on whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities 
the measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgment  is greater than likely to be realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the possible outcomes 
in accounting for income tax uncertainties  management is required to make judgments in the determination of the unit of account  the evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information in respect of the tax position taken  together with the estimates of amounts that the company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
shire develops its cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal expertise  experience and judgment  together with the assistance from professional advisors 
original estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
for example  during the year to december  the company recognized additional interest expense of million on its provision for uncertain tax positions following the receipt of new information on the amount of interest that may be payable upon settlement of the relevant tax position 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially higher or lower tax expense in future periods  which could significantly impact the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  we do not believe it possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change in assumptions  estimates or judgments and the resultant change  if any  in our provision for uncertain tax positions  as any such change is dependent on factors such as changes in tax law or administrative practice  the amount and nature of additional taxes which may be asserted by the taxation authorities  and the willingness of the relevant tax authorities to negotiate a settlement to any such position 
at december  the company recognized a liability of million for total unrecognized tax benefits million and had accrued million million for the payment of interest and penalties 
the company is required in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance deposits to tax authorities on receipt of a tax assessment 
these payments are offset against the income tax liability but do not reduce the provision for unrecognised tax benefits 
the company has significant deferred tax assets due to various tax attributes including  net operating losses nols  tax credits from research and development  investment tax credits and alternative minimum tax principally in the republic of ireland  the us  germany and the uk 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods 
management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize these deferred tax assets  based upon the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nols and other tax attributes exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these tax attributes a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could significantly impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at december   the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million

shire records a loss contingency provision for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
best estimates are reviewed quarterly and estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period  which could materially impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
on november  the company announced that it had successfully settled all aspects of the tkt appraisal rights litigation with all parties 
shire paid the same price of per share originally offered to all tkt shareholders at the time of the july merger  plus interest 
the settlement represents a total payment of million  representing consideration at per share of million and an interest cost of million 
prior to reaching this settlement  the company accrued interest based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that may be awarded by the court to those former tkt shareholders who requested appraisal 
this estimate of interest was based on shire s cost of borrowing 
between the close of the merger and november  the company applied this interest rate on a quarterly compounding basis to the million of consideration to calculate its provision for interest 
upon reaching agreement in principle with all the dissenting shareholders  the company determined that settlement had become the probable manner through which the appraisal rights litigation would be resolved 
under current law  although not applicable in this case because the merger was entered into before the relevant amendment to the law became effective the court presumptively awards interest in appraisal rights cases at a statutory rate that is percentage points above the federal reserve discount rate as it varies over the duration of the case 
in connection with the settlement  the company agreed to an interest rate that approximates to this statutory rate 
based on the settlement  the company amended the method of determining its interest provision to reflect this revised manner of resolution  and recorded additional interest expense of million in its consolidated financial statements for the year to december  on reaching settlement with the dissenting shareholders
