table of contents proved and probable reserves all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and is the responsibility of management 
the preparation of our oil and gas reserves estimates is completed in accordance with our prescribed internal control procedures  which include verification of data input into reserves forecasting and economics evaluation software  as well as multi discipline management reviews  as described below 
the technical employee responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates has a bachelor of science in petroleum engineering  with more than years of experience including years of experience in reserve estimation and is a registered professional engineer in texas 
our reserves estimates are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by our petroleum engineering staff  are reviewed annually with management and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
the data reviewed includes  among other things  seismic data  well logs  production tests  reservoir pressures  individual well and field performance data 
the data incorporated into our interpretations includes structure and isopach maps  individual well and field performance and other engineering and geological work products such as material balance calculations and reservoir simulation to arrive at conclusions about individual well and field projections 
additionally  offset performance data  operating expenses  capital costs and product prices factor into estimating quantities of reserves 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental regulations  as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling 
sustained decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
actual quantities of reserves recovered will most likely vary from the estimates set forth below 
reserves and cash flow estimates rely on interpretations of data and require assumptions that may be inaccurate 
for a discussion of these interpretations and assumptions  see actual quantities of oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates under item a of this report 
our estimates of proved reserves  proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves and future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves at december   and and changes in proved reserves during the last three years are contained in supplementary financial information supplementary oil and gas disclosures estimated net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves in item of this report

table of contents proved reserves 
our year end proved reserves of tcfe increased as compared to our proved reserves at year end  and consisted of  bcfe proved developed producing  bcfe proved developed non producing and  bcfe proved undeveloped reserves 
our proved reserves include bcfe of additions resulting from the change in the securities and exchange commission sec definition of proved reserves  expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond one direct offset away from producing wells if such locations meet the definition of proved reserves 
at december  our estimated proved undeveloped reserves were  bcfe 
during  we spent million of drilling  completion and facilities related capital to convert bcfe of our december  proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves 
another bcfe of our beginning of year proved undeveloped reserves were removed from the proved undeveloped category during  substantially all of which were no longer economic utilizing a natural gas price of per mmbtu for our year end reserve calculations 
during  we added bcfe of new proved undeveloped reserves through drilling activities 
additionally  we added bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves as a result of the change in the sec definition of proved reserves expanding proved undeveloped reserve locations beyond one direct offset away from producing wells 
these additions were primarily in our woodford shale and monument butte fields 
proved undeveloped reserve quantities were limited by the activity level of development drilling we expect to undertake during the five year period 
quantities of reserves that would otherwise meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for the fact that they will be developed beyond the five year horizon bcfe have been classified as probable reserves  in accordance with sec regulations 
as a result of the foregoing  our proved undeveloped reserves at december  were  bcfe  of which have been included in our reserve report for less than five years 
for additional information regarding the changes in our proved reserves  see proved reserves under item of this report 
probable reserves 
our probable reserves at year end consisted of bcfe developed and  bcfe of undeveloped reserves 
included in our undeveloped probable reserves are bcfe that would otherwise meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for the fact that they will not be developed during the five year horizon 
a significant portion of these probable reserves are associated with our woodford shale activities 

table of contents reserves sensitivities 
to determine our year end reserves estimates  we utilized the unweighted average first day of the month natural gas and crude oil prices for the prior twelve months  or per mmbtu and per barrel  respectively  adjusted for market differentials 
in  we experienced low average natural gas prices and  as a result  the estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves are substantially lower than at year end on a unit of reserve basis  but are substantially offset by higher quantities of proved reserves 
the table below illustrates changes in the quantities of proved and probable reserves at various price scenarios  holding all other year end reserve assumptions constant 
proved reserves probable reserves natural natural price case oil gas total oil gas total mmbtu for natural gas and bbl for oil mbbls bcf bcfe mbbls bcf bcfe assumed and pricing per sec rules and assumed and assumed and our proved reserves increase at higher prices primarily as a result of extending the economic life of our proved developed reserves 
higher realized prices do not materially increase the quantity of our proved undeveloped reserves because it is limited by the level of development drilling we expect to undertake during the five year period 
this limitation impacts our woodford shale natural gas and our monument butte field crude oil developments because of their size 
our probable reserves increase approximately bcfe utilizing a per mmbtu natural gas price instead of a per mmbtu natural gas price  with no change in oil prices 
the increase is attributable to quantities of reserves associated with our woodford shale activities that are not commercial at a per mmbtu natural gas price 
these probable reserves would meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for the fact that they would be developed beyond the five year horizon 
accordingly  a total of approximately  bcfe  or  of our probable reserves at a per mmbtu natural gas price would meet the definition of proved undeveloped reserves except for the fact that they would be developed beyond the five year horizon 
our proved reserves decrease at lower crude oil prices as a result of shortening the economic life of our proved developed reserves 
crude oil prices at the levels shown in the table above would not change our development plans and  therefore  have no impact on the quantity of proved undeveloped reserves because that quantity is limited by the level of development drilling we expect to undertake during the five year period 
our proved undeveloped oil reserves lie primarily in our monument butte field 
under the terms of our production sharing contracts in malaysia and china  an increase or decrease in realized oil prices would result in a decrease or increase  respectively  in our proved reserves 
at higher oil prices  lesser quantities of oil are required for cost recovery and at lower oil prices greater quantities of oil are required for cost recovery 
our share the contractor s share of future production is impacted accordingly 
the effect of higher or lower oil prices may be partially offset by extending or shortening  respectively  the economic life of proved reserves

table of contents title to properties we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards 
individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty  overriding royalty  carried  net profits  working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry 
in addition  interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments  ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes  development obligations under oil and gas leases or capital commitments under production sharing contracts or exploration licenses 
as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties  often little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition 
investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 
marketing substantially all of our oil and gas production is sold to a variety of purchasers under short term less than months contracts at market sensitive prices 
for a list of purchasers of our oil and gas production that accounted for or more of our consolidated revenue for the three preceding calendar years  please see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies major customers  to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are readily available with the exception of purchasers of our monument butte field oil production 
due to the higher paraffin content of this production  there is limited refining capacity for it 
please see the discussion under there is limited refining capacity for our black wax crude oil  which may limit our ability to sell our current production or to increase our production at monument butte in the uinta basin in item a of this report 
competition competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the hiring and retention of technical personnel  the acquisition of properties and access to drilling rigs and other services in the gulf of mexico 
for a further discussion  please see the information regarding competition set forth in item a of this report 
employees as of february   we had  employees 
all but of our employees were located in the us none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that relationships with our employees are satisfactory 
regulation exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations 
an overview of these regulations is set forth below 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  current regulatory requirements may change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered 
please see the discussion under the caption we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
in addition  potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity  delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business 
in item a of this report 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
our sales of natural gas are affected directly or indirectly by the availability  terms and cost of natural gas transportation 
the prices and terms for access to pipeline transportation of natural gas are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the natural 
table of contents gas act nga and by regulations and orders promulgated under the nga by the ferc 
in certain limited circumstances  intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by congress and by ferc regulations 
the outer continental shelf lands act  or ocsla  requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open access  non discriminatory service 
there are currently no regulations implemented by the ferc under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction 
therefore  we do not believe that any ferc or mms action taken under ocsla will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it will affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
pursuant to authority enacted in the energy policy act of epa  ferc has promulgated anti manipulation regulations  violations of which make it unlawful for any entity  directly or indirectly  in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc to use or employ any device  scheme  or artifice to defraud  to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made  not misleading  or to engage in any act  practice  or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any entity 
violation of this requirement  similar to violations of other nga and ferc requirements  may be penalized by the ferc up to million per day per violation 
ferc may also order disgorgement of profit and corrective action 
we believe  however  that neither the epa nor the regulations promulgated by ferc as a result of the epa will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
our sales of natural gas and crude are also subject to requirements under commodity exchange act cea and regulations promulgated thereunder by the commodity futures trading commission cftc 
the cea prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity 
the cea also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity 
the current statutory and regulatory framework governing interstate natural gas transactions is subject to change in the future  and the nature of such changes is impossible to predict 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc  the cftc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated 
in the past  the federal government regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold 
congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  there is always some risk  however  that congress may reenact price controls in the future 
changes in law and to ferc policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines  and we cannot predict what future action the ferc will take 
therefore  there is no assurance that the current regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
we do not believe  however  that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil 
our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other crude oil and condensate producers 
federal leases 
many of our domestic oil and gas leases are granted by the federal government and administered by the mms or the blm  both federal agencies 
mms and blm leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed blm or mms regulations and  in the case of offshore leases  orders pursuant to ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease 
some stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the time during which activities on the lease may be conducted  the manner in 
table of contents which certain activities may be conducted or  in some cases  may ban surface activity 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration  development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the blm or the mms  as applicable  prior to the commencement of drilling  and comply with regulations governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for production facilities  safety procedures  plugging and abandonment of wells on the shelf and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the shelf  the mms generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the mms 
under certain circumstances  the blm or the mms  as applicable  may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the mms regulations governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases provide that the mms will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases 
the epa formalizes the royalty in kind program of the mms  providing that the mms may take royalties in kind if the secretary of the interior determines that the benefits are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in value 
we believe that the mms s royalty in kind program will not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in  the mms amended its regulations to require additional filing fees 
the mms has estimated that these additional filing fees will represent less than of the revenues of companies with offshore operations in most cases 
we do not believe that these additional filing fees will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
state and local regulation of drilling and production 
we own interests in properties located onshore in a number of states and in state waters offshore texas and louisiana 
these states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
the laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials  the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled  unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
some states have the power to prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
the cost of compliance could be significant 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial and damage payment obligations  or the issuance of injunctive relief including orders to cease operations 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we also are subject to various environmental permit requirements 
both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
moreover  some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability  which could subject us to liability for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or conduct or conditions caused by prior operators or third parties 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
the oil pollution act  or opa  imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the 
table of contents owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel or pipeline  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns strict  joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of such limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to million for onshore facilities 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa also requires operators in the gulf of mexico to demonstrate to the mms that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
under opa and implementing mms regulations  responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least million for an oil spill in state waters and at least million for an oil spill in federal waters 
in addition to opa  our discharges to waters of the us are further limited by the federal clean water act  or cwa  and analogous state laws 
the cwa prohibits any discharge into waters of the united states except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies 
failure to comply with the cwa  including discharge limits set by permits issued pursuant to the cwa  may also result in administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
the opa and cwa also require the preparation of oil spill response plans and spill prevention  control and countermeasure or spcc plans 
we have such plans in place and have made changes as necessary due to changes by the us environmental protection agency  also known as the epa  and delays in epa rulemaking 
the final epa rule was published in november and became effective on january   with a compliance deadline of november ocsla authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the shelf 
specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures operating or located on the shelf 
violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to ocsla can result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and imposes certain environmental cleanup obligations 
although rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy  the epa and state agencies may regulate these wastes as solid wastes 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
such responsible persons may be subject to joint and several liability under the superfund law for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years 
many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the superfund law  rcra and analogous state laws and common law obligations  and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties  including soil or groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators  or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 

table of contents the clean air act caa or the clean air act and comparable state statutes restrict the emission of air pollutants and affects both onshore and offshore oil and gas operations 
new facilities may be required to obtain separate construction and operating permits before construction work can begin or operations may start  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
also  the epa has developed and continues to develop more stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants  and is considering the regulation of additional air pollutants and air pollutant parameters 
these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities 
the occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
the osha hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees 
other osha standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations 
failure to comply with osha requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties 
congress has been actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
in june of  the us house of representatives passed a cap and trade bill known as the american clean energy and security act of  which is now being considered by the us senate 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
further  on april   the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on april   epa responded to the massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa decision with a proposed finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
epa published the final version of this finding on december   which allowed epa to proceed with the rulemaking process to regulate greenhouse gases under the clean air act 
in anticipation of the finalization of epa s finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare  and that greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles contribute to climate change  epa proposed a rule in september of that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and would trigger applicability of clean air act permitting requirements for certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions 
in response to this issue  epa also proposed a tailoring rule that would  in general  only impose greenhouse gas permitting requirements on facilities that emit more than  tons per year of greenhouse gases 
moreover  on september   epa finalized a rule requiring nation wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in for emissions occurring in the rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year  and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas  as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows  in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other hydrocarbon products that we produce 
international regulations

the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
proved undeveloped reserves 
in general  proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
the sec provides a complete definition of undeveloped oil and gas reserves in rule a of regulation s x 
reserve life index 
this index is calculated by dividing total proved reserves at year end by annual production to estimate the number of years of remaining production 
shelf 
the us outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
water depths generally range from feet to  feet 
tcfe 
one trillion cubic feet equivalent  determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil or condensate 
unconventional resource plays 
plays targeting tight sand  coal bed or gas shale reservoirs 
the reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps  seals and discrete hydrocarbon water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs 
these reservoirs generally require stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economically 
undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
working interest 
the operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production 

table of contents item a 
risk factors there are many factors that may affect newfield s business and results of operations 
you should carefully consider  in addition to the other information contained in this report  the risks described below 
oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas 
lower prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
oil and gas prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount that we can borrow under our credit facility could be limited by changing expectations of future prices because the maximum amount that we may borrow under our credit facility is determined by our lenders annually each may  and may be adjusted at the option of our lenders in the case of certain acquisitions or divestitures  using a process that takes into account the value of our estimated reserves and hedge position and the lenders commodity price assumptions 
among the factors that can cause fluctuations in oil and gas prices are the domestic and foreign supply of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  the price and availability of  and demand for  alternative fuels  weather conditions and climate change  changes in supply and demand  world wide economic conditions  the price of foreign imports  the availability  proximity and capacity of transportation facilities and processing facilities  the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets  including commodity price speculators and others  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions  and the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  including environmental regulation 
we have substantial capital requirements to fund our business plans  and a slow recovery of the economy and the financial markets in or another decline or crisis as was experienced in late and could negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan 
although we anticipate that our capital spending  excluding acquisitions  will correspond with our anticipated cash flows  we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from operations do not necessarily match 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired 
in addition  in the past  we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
we may have to reduce capital expenditures  and our ability to execute our business plans could be adversely affected  if one or more of the lenders under our existing credit arrangements fail to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us  the amount that we are allowed to borrow under our existing credit facility is reduced as a result of lower oil and gas prices  declines in reserves  lending requirements or for other reasons or our customers or working interest owners default on their obligations to us 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and involves the risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
reducing our 
table of contents exposure to price volatility is intended to help ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and to help us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
although the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  it also may limit the benefit from price increases and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the hedged volume or there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge transaction 
hedging transactions also involve the risk that counterparties  which generally are financial institutions  may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us 
although we have entered into hedging contracts with multiple counterparties to mitigate our exposure to any individual counterparty  if any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations to us under the hedging contracts or seek bankruptcy protection  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes 
in addition  in poor economic environments and tight financial markets  the risk of a counterparty default is heightened  and it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in future hedging transactions  which could result in greater concentration of our exposure to any one counterparty or a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes 
to maintain and grow our production and cash flow  we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves 
through our drilling programs and the acquisition of properties  we strive to maintain and grow our production and cash flow 
however  as we produce from our properties  our reserves decline 
we may be unable to find  develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
actual quantities of oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves will most likely vary from our estimates 
estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires a number of economic assumptions  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the proved and probable reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates 
actual quantities of oil and gas reserves  future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses will most likely vary from our estimates  with the variability likely to be higher for probable reserves estimates 
in addition  the methodologies and evaluation techniques that we use  which include the use of multiple technologies  data sources and interpretation methods  may be different than those used by our competitors 
further  reserve estimates are subject to the evaluator s criteria and judgment and show important variability  particularly in the early stages of an oil and gas development 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and net present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development activities and prevailing oil and gas prices 
our reserves also may be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with new sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  and costs in effect at year end 
actual 
table of contents future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs we used 
in addition  actual production rates for future periods may vary significantly from the rates assumed in the calculation 
there is limited refining capacity for our black wax crude oil  which may limit our ability to sell our current production or to increase our production at monument butte in the uinta basin 
most of the crude oil we produce in the uinta basin is known as black wax because it has higher paraffin content than crude oil found in most other major north american basins 
due to its wax content  it must remain heated during shipping  so the oil is transported by truck to refiners in the salt lake city area 
we currently have agreements in place with area refiners that secure base load sales of substantially all of our expected production in the uinta basin through the end of in the current economic environment  there is a risk that they may fail to satisfy their obligations to us under those contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  the largest purchaser of our black wax crude oil failed to pay for certain deliveries of crude oil and filed for bankruptcy protection 
although we continue to sell our black wax crude oil to that purchaser on a short term basis that provides for more timely cash payments  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to sell to this purchaser or that similar substitute arrangements could be made for sales of our black wax crude oil with other purchasers if desired 
an extended loss of our largest purchaser could have a material adverse effect on us because there are limited purchasers of our black wax crude 
we continue to work with refiners to expand the market for our existing black wax crude oil production and to secure additional capacity to allow for production growth 
however  without additional refining capacity  our ability to increase production from the field may be limited 
lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments 
we capitalize the costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method 
the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling test writedown 
as of december   we recorded a billion billion after tax ceiling test writedown 
we recorded an additional billion million after tax ceiling test writedown as of march  although a ceiling test writedown does not impact cash flow from operations  it does reduce our stockholders equity 
once recorded  a ceiling test writedown is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
the risk that we will be required to further write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values  or if estimated future development costs increase 
we may experience further ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in the future 
in addition  any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity 
drilling is a high risk activity 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  the drilling of wells involves the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  equipment and materials  adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  equipment failures or accidents  lack of necessary services or qualified personnel  availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses  
table of contents availability  costs and terms of contractual arrangements  such as leases  pipelines and related facilities to gather  process and compress  transport and market natural gas  crude oil and related commodities  and compliance with  or changes in  environmental  tax and other laws and regulations 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  and insurance may not protect us against all of these risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
our oil and gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and gas  including the risk of fires and explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable or unknown flows of oil  gas  formation water or drilling fluids  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  pipe or cement failures and casing collapses  pipeline ruptures  discharges of toxic gases  build up of naturally occurring radioactive materials  and vandalism 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property and equipment  and oil and gas reservoirs  pollution and other environmental damage  investigatory and clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repairs to resume operations 
if we experience any of these problems  our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
offshore and deepwater operations are subject to a variety of operating risks  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions have in the past  and may in the future  cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
some of our offshore operations  and most of our deepwater and international operations  are dependent upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities that we do not own 
necessary infrastructures have been in the past  and may be in the future  temporarily unavailable due to adverse weather conditions or other reasons or may not be available to us in the future at all or on acceptable terms 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these potential risks and losses 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not insurable 
exploration in deepwater involves significant financial risks  and we may be unable to obtain the drilling rigs or support services necessary for our deepwater drilling and development programs in a timely manner or at acceptable rates 
much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure necessary for production 
as a result  development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy 
table of contents process and requires substantial capital investment  and it is difficult to estimate the timing of our production 
because of the size of significant projects in which we invest  we may not serve as the operator 
as a result  we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations related to these projects or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital or lead to unexpected future losses 
we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
in addition  potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity  delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business 
exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  response to unexpected releases to the environment  reports and permits concerning exploration  drilling  production and other operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  calculating royalties on oil and gas produced under federal and state leases  and taxation 
under these laws  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs  natural resource damages and other environmental damages 
we also could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness  wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  changes to existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us  our suppliers or our customers 
for example  governments around the world have become increasingly focused on climate change matters 
in the united states  legislation that directly impacts our industry has been proposed covering areas such as emission reporting and reductions  hydraulic fracturing  the repeal of certain oil and gas tax incentives and tax deductions  and the regulation of over the counter commodity hedging activities 
these and other potential regulations could increase our costs  reduce our liquidity  delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business  negatively impacting our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
congress has been actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
in june of  the us house of representatives passed a cap and trade bill known as the american clean energy and security act of  which is now being considered by the us senate 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
further  on april   the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on april   epa responded to the massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa decision with a proposed finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
epa published the final version of this finding on december   which allowed epa to proceed with the rulemaking process to regulate 
table of contents greenhouse gases under the clean air act 
in anticipation of the finalization of epa s finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare  and that greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles contribute to climate change  epa proposed a rule in september of that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and would trigger applicability of clean air act permitting requirements for certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions 
in response to this issue  epa also proposed a tailoring rule that would  in general  only impose greenhouse gas permitting requirements on facilities that emit more than  tons per year of greenhouse gases 
moreover  on september   epa finalized a rule requiring nation wide reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in for emissions occurring in the rule applies primarily to large facilities emitting  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per year  and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gas  as well as to manufacturers of vehicles and engines 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulation that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows  in addition to the demand for the natural gas and other hydrocarbon products that we produce 
the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
we deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
the lack of availability of capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our production through some firm transportation arrangements  third party systems and facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons  or may not be available to us in the future at a price that is acceptable to us 
any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities  as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities  could harm our business and  in turn  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have risks associated with our non us operations 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states is subject to the various risks inherent in international operations 
these risks may include currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrection  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  forced renegotiation of  or unilateral changes to  or termination of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  changes in laws and policies governing operations of non us based companies  our limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties  the operator s expertise or other labor problems  difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental entity because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations also may be adversely affected by the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment 
in addition  if a dispute arises with respect to our international 
table of contents operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of non us courts or may not be successful in subjecting non us persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states 
we may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices and their appropriate differentials  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections will not likely be performed on every well or facility  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
competition for experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results 
our continued drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists  engineers and other professionals 
despite the recent decline in commodity prices and lower industry activity levels  competition for these professionals remains strong 
we are likely to continue to experience increased costs to attract and retain these professionals 
there is competition for available oil and gas properties 
our competitors include major oil and gas companies  independent oil and gas companies and financial buyers 
some of our competitors may have greater and more diverse resources than we do 
high commodity prices and stiff competition for acquisitions have in the past  and may in the future  significantly increase the cost of available properties 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  some of our arrangements with employees and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change of control of our company  to acquire us or to replace incumbent management 
in addition  our change of control severance plan and agreements  our omnibus stock plans and our incentive compensation plan contain provisions that provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits  including accelerated vesting of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options  upon a change of control 
section of the delaware general corporation law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
these provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or reduce the price our stockholders receive in an acquisition of our company 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item legal proceedings we have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and are involved in various other disputes  all arising in the ordinary course of our business  such as claims from royalty owners for disputed royalty payments  commercial disputes  personal injury claims and property damage claims 
although the outcome of these lawsuits and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
our domestic areas of operation include the anadarko and arkoma basins of the mid continent  the rocky mountains  onshore texas and the gulf of mexico 
internationally  we are active in malaysia and china 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities including among other items  the determination of ceiling test writedowns 
any extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and access to capital 
please see the discussion under lower oil and gas prices and other factors have resulted in ceiling test writedowns in the past and may in the future result in additional ceiling test writedowns or other impairments in item a of this report and liquidity and capital resources below 
as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
reserve replacement 
to maintain and grow our production and cash flow  we must continue to develop existing reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced 
please see proved reserves below and supplementary financial information supplementary oil and gas disclosures estimated net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves in item of this report for the change in our total net proved reserves during the three year period ended december  substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
see items and  business and properties proved and probable reserves proved reserves 
significant estimates 
we believe the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are the quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  the timing of future drilling  development and abandonment activities  the cost of these activities in the future  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of acquired companies  the fair value of our financial instruments including derivative positions  and the fair value of stock based compensation 

table of contents accounting for hedging activities 
we do not designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience  significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
as of december   we had net derivative assets of million  of which was measured based upon our valuation model ie black scholes and  as such  is classified as a level fair value measurement 
we value these contracts using a model that considers various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c volatility factors  d counterparty credit risk and e current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments 
we utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates commodity derivative activities below and note  derivative financial instruments  and note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
results of operations significant events 
we completed several significant transactions during and and recorded ceiling test writedowns under the full cost method of accounting at the end of and the first quarter of  each of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows from period to period 
as of december   we recorded a billion ceiling test writedown 
we recorded an additional billion ceiling test writedown as of march  during the first six months of  we entered into a series of transactions that had the effect of resetting all of our then outstanding crude oil hedges for and at the time of the reset  the mark to market value of these hedge contracts was a liability of million and we paid an additional million to purchase option contracts 
in october  we sold all of our interests in the uk north sea for million in cash 
the historical results of operations of our uk north sea operations are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
except where noted  discussions in this report relate to continuing operations only 
in august  we sold our shallow water gulf of mexico assets for billion in cash and the purchaser s assumption of liabilities associated with future abandonment of wells and platforms 
in june  we acquired stone energy corporation s rocky mountain assets for million in cash 
initially  we financed this acquisition through borrowings under our revolving credit agreement

revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production 
the effects of the settlement of hedges designated for hedge accounting are included in revenue  but those not so designated have no effect on our reported revenues 
none of our outstanding oil and gas hedging contracts as of december  are designated for hedge accounting and the settlement of all hedging contracts during and had no effect on reported revenues 
however  revenues for include losses on the settlement of hedging contracts designated for hedge accounting of million 
please see note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold 
in addition  crude oil from our operations offshore malaysia and china is produced into fpsos and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated 
revenues are

all amounts for the year ended december  exclude the cash payments totaling million to reset our and crude oil hedges 

table of contents domestic production 
our domestic oil and gas production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  increased over production primarily due to increased production in our mid continent division as a result of continued successful drilling efforts  partially offset by natural field declines and the voluntary curtailment of approximately bcfe of production during the second half of from our mid continent division due to low natural gas prices 
our domestic oil and gas production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  decreased from production  primarily as a result of the sale of our shallow water gulf of mexico assets in august in addition  production was negatively impacted by the deferral of approximately bcfe of production related to the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
production from our june acquisition of stone energy corporation s rocky mountain assets partially offset the impact of the hurricanes 
without the impact of the gulf of mexico asset sale and the rocky mountain asset acquisition  our total oil and gas production increased over due to increased production in our mid continent and rocky mountain divisions as a result of continued successful drilling efforts 
international production 
our international oil production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  increased over production primarily due to new field developments on pm and pm in malaysia and the timing of liftings from our oil production in malaysia 
our international oil production increased over production primarily due to new field developments on pm in malaysia 
operating expenses 
we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production  or per mcfe  basis 
however  because of the previously noted significant events during  and and the year over year increases in our international production  period to period comparisons are difficult 
for example  offshore gulf of mexico properties typically have significantly higher lease operating costs relative to onshore properties and offshore production is not subject to production taxes but onshore production is subject to these taxes 

table of contents year ended december  compared to december  the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended december  unit of production total amount year ended percentage year ended percentage december  increase december  increase decrease decrease per mcfe in millions domestic lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test and other impairments other total operating expenses international lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test writedown total operating expenses total lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test and other impairments other total operating expenses domestic operations 
our domestic operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  decreased over primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded at december  and the magnitude of the full cost ceiling test writedowns recorded at december  and march  the components of the period to period change are as follows lease operating expense loe decreased per mcfe due to lower overall operating and service costs and the increase in production volumes period over period 
production and other taxes decreased per mcfe due to significantly lower realized commodity prices period over period 
we received refunds of million per mcfe during related to production tax exemptions on some of our onshore wells  whereas we received similar refunds of million per mcfe during our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate decreased per mcfe primarily as a result of the ceiling test writedowns recorded at december  and march  general and administrative g a expense per mcfe decreased period over period while total g a expense increased slightly 
the decrease per mcfe is primarily due to the increase in production volumes period over period 
the slight increase in total g a is primarily due to increased employee related expenses associated with our growing domestic workforce offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expense  which is calculated based on adjusted net income as defined in our incentive 
table of contents compensation plan 
adjusted net income for purposes of our incentive compensation plan excluded a unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and b the impact from any full cost ceiling test writedowns 
additionally  we match the costs benefits of the crude oil hedge unwind reset with the period in which these barrels are produced for the purposes of determining adjusted net income 
during  we capitalized million per mcfe of direct internal costs as compared to million per mcfe in in  we recorded a ceiling test writedown of billion per mcfe due to significantly lower natural gas prices at march  in  we recorded a ceiling test writedown of billion per mcfe due to significantly lower oil and gas commodity prices at year end in  we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million per mcfe due to the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization at that time 
other expenses for primarily includes long term rig contract termination fees resulting from our decision to limit our capital expenditures to a level that we expected to be funded with cash flows from operations 
other expenses for includes the reversal of a portion of accrued business interruption insurance claims related to hurricane ivan which were determined during to be uncollectible 
international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  decreased over the same period of primarily due to the full cost ceiling test writedown in malaysia and significantly higher production taxes during due to substantially higher oil prices 
the components of the period to period change are as follows loe decreased per mcfe while total loe increased slightly over the decrease in loe per mcfe is primarily due to increased production volumes associated with the new field developments on pm and pm in malaysia and lower overall operating and service costs 
production and other taxes decreased significantly due to substantially lower realized oil prices during total dd a expense increased primarily due to additional production volumes and the timing of liftings of these volumes associated with new field developments on pm and pm in malaysia  partially offset by a decrease in the dd a rate resulting from the malaysia ceiling test writedown

our domestic operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  increased over due primarily to a full cost ceiling test writedown and goodwill impairment charge 
the components of the period to period change are as follows loe decreased per mcfe due to the sale of our shallow water gulf of mexico properties in august  which had relatively high loe per mcfe 
our loe was adversely impacted by repair expenditures of million per mcfe related to the storms 
without the impact of the repair expenditures related to the storms  our loe would have been per mcfe 
the decrease in loe was partially offset by higher operating costs in for all our operations 
production and other taxes decreased per mcfe due to refunds of million per mcfe related to production tax exemptions on some of our onshore wells recorded during compared to refunds of million per mcfe recorded during the benefit of the refunds was partially offset by increased commodity prices and increased production from our mid continent and rocky mountain operations  which are subject to production taxes  and the sale of our gulf of mexico properties  which were not subject to production taxes 

table of contents our dd a rate increased per mcfe while total dd a expense decreased period over period primarily due to the sale of our gulf of mexico properties in august the increase in the dd a rate per mcfe was due to higher cost reserve additions 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in accretion expense due to the significant reduction in our asset retirement obligation following the sale of our gulf of mexico properties 
g a expense per mcfe remained flat period over period while total g a expense decreased over the decrease in total g a expense was primarily due to a litigation settlement reserve associated with a statewide royalty owner class action lawsuit in oklahoma which was partially offset by increased employee related expenses in due to our increased domestic workforce

international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  increased over the same period of primarily due to higher production taxes and a full cost ceiling test writedown in malaysia 
the components of the period to period change are as follows loe decreased per mcfe while total loe increased over the decrease on a per unit basis resulted from increased liftings in malaysia 
the increase in total loe was primarily due to new field developments on pm and pm and higher operating costs in malaysia

we capitalize interest with respect to our unproved properties 
capitalized interest during decreased as compared to due to a reduction in our unproved property base resulting from the evaluation of such leasehold acreage 
interest capitalized during increased over due to an increase in our unproved property base primarily as a result of the rocky mountain asset acquisition in june commodity derivative income expense 
the significant fluctuation in commodity derivative income expense from year to year is due to the extreme volatility of oil and gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these years 
taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was different than the federal statutory tax rate for all three years primarily due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits  state income taxes and the differences between international and us federal statutory rates 
our effective tax rate for increased because we released the valuation allowance related to the tax benefit associated with the malaysia ceiling test writedown recorded in the fourth quarter of our effective tax rate for decreased from because during we were not able to recognize the full tax benefit associated with the million ceiling test writedown in malaysia and the million goodwill impairment charge did not generate a tax benefit 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices  the timing  amount  and location of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources we must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flow 
we accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties 
these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
lower prices for oil and gas may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as further described below 
we establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year 
our capital budget is billion and focuses on projects we believe will generate and lay the foundation for production growth 
our capital budget excluding acquisitions is guided by our anticipated cash flows 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired 
in addition  in the past  we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
we continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations 
on january   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due and received net proceeds of million 
these notes were issued at of par to yield 
we used million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  million to fund the acquisition of assets from txco resources inc and we tendered for approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due we continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of million 
we attempt to sell these securities every days until the auctions succeed  the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature 
we currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent nor that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements 
see note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the auction rate securities 

table of contents credit arrangements 
we have a revolving credit facility that matures in june and provides for loan commitments of billion from a syndicate of more than financial institutions  led by jpmorgan chase bank as agent 
as of december   the largest commitment was of total commitments 
however  the amount that we can borrow under the facility could be limited by changing expectations of future oil and gas prices because the maximum amount that we may borrow under the facility is determined by our lenders annually each may and may be adjusted at the option of our lenders in the case of certain acquisitions or divestitures using a process that takes into account the value of our estimated reserves and hedge position and the lenders commodity price assumptions 
in the future  total commitments under the facility could be increased to a maximum of billion if the existing lenders increase their individual loan commitments or new financial institutions are added to the facility 
we do not believe we could access such additional capacity in the current credit market 
in addition  subject to compliance with covenants in our credit facility that restrict our ability to incur additional debt  we also have a total of million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions  the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions 
for a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements  please see note  debt  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
at february   we had million of undrawn letters of credit and outstanding borrowings of million under our billion credit facility 
our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately billion as of february  working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
without the effects of commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
although we anticipate that our capital spending excluding acquisitions will correspond with our anticipated cash flows  we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from operations do not necessarily match 
at december   we had positive working capital of million 
the decrease in our working capital balance as compared to december  is primarily due to a million decrease in net derivative assets and their related deferred taxes resulting from the settlement of contracts during  partially offset by the timing of receivable collections from purchasers  payments made by us to vendors and other operators  and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations 
at december   we had positive working capital of million 
during  we used million of cash and short term investments on hand at the beginning of to fund a portion of our capital program and reclassified million of our auction rate securities from short term to long term investments 
in addition  at december   we had a net derivative asset of million compared to a net derivative liability of million at december  these working capital increases were partially offset by a change in our net current deferred tax position 
our net current deferred tax position was a liability of million at december  compared to an asset of million at december  cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations both continuing and discontinued are primarily affected by production and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital 
we sell substantially all of our oil and gas production under floating price market sensitive contracts 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months 
see oil and gas hedging below 
we typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within days of production 
as a result  cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate  but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by dd a  ceiling test writedowns  other impairments  or other non cash charges or credits 
our net cash flow from operations was billion in  an increase of compared to net cash flow from operations of million in this increase is primarily due to cash receipts related to 
table of contents derivative settlements of million during compared to cash payments of million during the cash payments in included million to reset our and crude oil hedging contracts effectively settling the liability on our balance sheet at that time 
our net cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by lower average realized commodity prices during the year 
our working capital requirements during increased compared to as a result of the timing of drilling activities  receivable collections from purchasers  payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations 
our net cash flow from operations was million in  a decrease of compared to net cash flow from operations of billion in this decrease is primarily due to the million paid in to reset our and crude oil hedging contracts 
even though our production volumes were impacted by our property sales  the impact of this transaction on net cash flows from operations was somewhat offset by higher average realized commodity prices during  increased production from our mid continent and rocky mountain divisions and increased liftings in malaysia 
our working capital requirements during decreased compared to as a result of the timing of drilling activities  receivable collections from purchasers  payments made by us to vendors and other operators  and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was billion compared to billion for during  we spent billion including million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  received proceeds of million from sales of oil and gas properties  and redeemed investments of million 
during  we spent billion including million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  and purchased investments of million and redeemed investments of million 
capital expenditures 
our capital spending of billion for decreased from our billion of capital spending during these amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of million in and million in of the billion spent in  we invested million in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in acquisitions of proved and unproved property leasehold and domestic leasing activity and million outside the united states 
our capital spending of billion for decreased from our billion of capital spending during these amounts exclude recorded asset retirement obligations of million in and million in of the billion spent in  we invested billion in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in acquisitions includes the acquisition of properties in south texas and domestic leasing activity and million outside the united states 
we have budgeted billion for capital spending in  including million of estimated capitalized interest and overhead 
approximately of the billion is initially allocated to the mid continent  to the rocky mountains  to the gulf of mexico  to onshore texas  and to international projects 
see items and  business and properties our properties and plans for the capital budget is based on our expectation that we will live within anticipated cash flow from operations excluding acquisitions 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired 
in addition  in the past  we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
we continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities

proved reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flow  we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced 
the following is a discussion of proved reserves  reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves 
bcfe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions reserve revisions sales production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year our proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end our proved crude oil and condensate reserves at year end were million barrels compared to million barrels at year end and million barrels at year end natural gas comprised about  and of our proved reserves at year end  and  respectively 
reserve additions and revisions 
during  we added bcfe net proved reserves as a result of additions extensions  discoveries  improved recovery and purchases of reserves in place and revisions  as described below 
of this amount  bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves primarily associated with our woodford shale and monument butte fields was the result of the changes in sec reserves reporting rules expanding proved undeveloped reserves beyond one offset to a proved developed location 
we expect the majority of future reserve additions to be associated with infill drilling  extensions of current fields and new discoveries  as well as improved recovery operations and purchases of proved properties 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
additions 
we added  bcfe proved reserves during  approximately bcfe of which were the result of successful development drilling in our mid continent and rocky mountain business units 
during  we added bcfe of proved reserves  approximately bcfe of which were as a result of successful drilling efforts in the mid continent and rocky mountains 
during  we added bcfe of proved reserves 
of this amount  bcfe was related to successful development drilling in our mid continent and 
table of contents onshore gulf coast business units and approximately bcfe was related to our purchase of reserves in place primarily associated with the acquisition of stone energy s rocky mountain assets in june revisions 
total revisions in were a negative bcfe  or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions included a negative price revision of bcfe primarily related to our onshore natural gas plays  such as the woodford shale  and were primarily proven undeveloped reserves 
the remaining bcfe of revisions in were negative performance revisions and were principally proved developed producing reserve revisions 
total revisions for were a negative bcfe and were primarily price related domestic revisions associated with the decrease in both oil and gas prices from to total revisions for were a negative bcfe and were primarily performance revisions associated with our onshore gulf coast properties 
sales 
during  we sold approximately bcfe of reserves associated with our domestic operations 
in  sales of reserves were negligible 
substantially all the bcfe of sales of oil and gas reserves during were related to our shallow water gulf of mexico assets and our coal bed methane assets in the cherokee basin of oklahoma 
future net cash flows 
at december   the present value discounted at of estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves was billion stated in accordance with the regulations of the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month oil and gas prices for the prior twelve months held flat for the life of the reserves 
this amount is unchanged from the billion at december  despite lower natural gas prices utilized to calculate proved reserves 
reserve quantity additions as a result of our drilling success during coupled with the additional reserve quantities recognized as a result of the sec s new reserves rules offset the impact of the lower natural gas prices utilized to calculate proved reserves 
the decrease of billion  or  in compared to is primarily due to lower commodity prices at year end see supplementary financial information supplementary oil and gas disclosures standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves under item of this report 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of our proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money to the evaluating party and the perceived risks inherent in producing oil and gas

as is common in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration  development and production activities 
we have work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic data  natural gas transportation  and fulfilling other cash commitments 
at december   these work related commitments totaled million and were comprised of million in our domestic business and million internationally 
our domestic obligation relates to a year firm transportation agreement for our mid continent production 
this obligation is subject to the completion of construction  which is expected during the second quarter of  and upon required regulatory approvals 
actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted 
as of december   we have delivery commitments through to deliver to third party purchasers approximately  mmbtu of our daily production  principally from our mid continent division 
given the size of our proved natural gas reserves and production capacity in our mid continent division  we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these delivery commitments

the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes may limit our ability under certain circumstances to  among other things incur additional debt  make restricted payments  pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  create liens  
table of contents engage in transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and sales and other dispositions of assets 
on january   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due and received net proceeds of million 
these notes were issued at of par to yield 
we used million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  million to fund the acquisition of assets from txco resources inc and we tendered for approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due commitments under joint operating agreements 
most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
oil and gas hedging as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
as of february   approximately of our estimated production was subject to derivative contracts including basis contracts 
in  of our production was subject to derivative contracts  compared to in and in while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
all of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables and receivables from separate hedging arrangements with that counterparty 
at december   barclays capital  jpmorgan chase bank  na  credit suisse energy llc  credit agricole corporate investment bank london branch  j aron company and societe generale were the counterparties with respect to of our future hedged production  none of which were counterparty to more than of our future hedged production 
a significant number of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements also are lenders under our credit facility 
our credit facility  senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations 
none of our derivative contracts contain collateral posting requirements  however  two of our derivative contracts contain a provision that would permit the counterparty  in certain circumstances  to request adequate assurance of our performance under the contract 

table of contents substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
historically  a majority of our hedged oil and gas production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges 
the price that we receive for natural gas production from the gulf of mexico and onshore gulf coast  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically averages per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 
realized natural gas prices for our mid continent properties  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically average of the henry hub index 
in the rocky mountains  we hedged basis associated with approximately bcf of our natural gas production from january through december to lock in the differential at a weighted average of per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 
in total  this hedge and the  mmbtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of per mmbtu 
in the mid continent  we hedged basis associated with approximately bcf of our anticipated stiles britt ranch natural gas production from january through august in total  this hedge and the  mmbtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of per mmbtu 
we have also hedged basis associated with approximately bcf of our natural gas production from this area for the period september through december at an average of per mmbtu 
the price we receive for our gulf coast oil production typically averages about of the nymex west texas intermediate wti price 
the price we receive for our oil production in the rocky mountains is currently averaging about per barrel below the wti price 
oil production from our mid continent properties typically averages of the wti price 
oil sales from our operations in malaysia typically sell at a slight discount to tapis  or about of wti 
oil sales from our operations in china typically sell at per barrel less than the wti price 
please see the discussion and tables in note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the accounting applicable to our hedging program  a listing of open contracts as of december  and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of that date 
between january  and february   we did not enter into additional derivative contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with the audit committee of our board of directors 
see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting 
table of contents policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into four categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company 
accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions 
stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards  the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments 
oil and gas activities 
accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  costs in effect at year end and a discount rate 
on december   the sec issued modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule 
the final rule adopts revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on forms k for years ending on or after december  on january   the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures asu  which aligns the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of fasb accounting standards codification topic  extractive industries oil and gas topic  with the requirements in the sec s final rule 
we adopted the final rule and asu effective december  the following critical accounting policies and estimates discussions have been updated to reflect the new rules unless stated otherwise 
see new accounting requirements below for a full discussion 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development costs  are amortized on a 
table of contents unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials and under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of dd a expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
to change our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately  or bcfe 
to change our malaysia dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in malaysia of approximately  or bcfe 
since production from our china operations is immaterial  any change in the dd a rate as a result of changes in our proved reserves in china would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
the ceiling value of oil and gas reserves is calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter 
the full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting  if any 
at december   the ceiling value of our oil and gas reserves was calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
based on these prices  the cost center ceilings with respect to our properties in the us  malaysia and china exceeded the net capitalized costs of the respective properties 
as such  no ceiling test writedowns were required 
holding all other factors constant  if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months for oil or gas were to decline approximately from prices used at december   it is possible we could experience a domestic full cost ceiling test writedown 
holding all other factors constant  it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in malaysia and china if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month oil price declined approximately and  respectively  from prices used at december  at march   prior to our adoption of the final rule and asu  the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period end market prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and 
table of contents per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
using these prices  the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at march  exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately billion million  after tax  resulting in a ceiling test writedown 
given the fluctuation of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term 
if the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months decline  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
costs withheld from amortization 
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
in addition  a portion of incurred if not previously included in the amortization base and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization 
to qualify  a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development eg  the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled 
incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work 
any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   we had a total of approximately billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools 
the application of the full cost ceiling test at december  resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each full cost pool 
holding all other factors constant  inclusion of approximately of our unevaluated property costs in our domestic amortization base would have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location  type of production structure  water depth  reservoir depth and characteristics  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates 
the accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 

table of contents holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates are revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
to change our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately  or million 
to change our malaysia dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in malaysia of approximately  or million 
since production from our china operations is immaterial  any change in the dd a rate as a result of changes in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in china would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations 
as part of our growth strategy  we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill 
as the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments  the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain 
the value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under full cost ceiling limitation above 
the accounting for business combinations changed effective january  and established how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition  measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction 
the standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december  we adopted the standard effective january  commodity derivative activities 
we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
under accounting rules  we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
beginning in late  we elected not to designate any future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts  we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative 
our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c volatility factors  d counterparty credit risk and e current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent  third party quotations 

table of contents the determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements such as cash deposits  letters of credit and priority interests 
we utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties 
stock based compensation 
we apply a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
for equity based compensation awards  compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification  and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice based model for our performance and market based restricted stock 
see note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock based compensation 
new accounting requirements in september  the fasb defined fair value  established criteria to be considered when measuring fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for all recurring measures of financial assets and liabilities eg derivatives and investment securities for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted the provisions for all recurring measures of financial assets and liabilities on january  in february  the fasb issued additional authoritative guidance  which granted a one year deferral of the effective date as it applies to non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis eg those measured at fair value in a business combination and asset retirement obligations 
beginning january   we applied the provisions to non financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb established how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the standard also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and determines what information to disclose in the financial statements 
the standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we adopted the standard effective january  the adoption of the standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations  but may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for businesses we acquire post adoption 
in march  the fasb issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities that is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we adopted the disclosure requirements beginning january  please see note  derivative financial instruments additional disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which makes fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles  enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures  and provides greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
the additional guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we adopted the provisions for the period ending march  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
although there is new terminology  the guidance is based on the same principles as those that previously existed 
this guidance is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  our adoption of 
table of contents these provisions beginning with the period ending june  did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the sec issued the final rule 
the final rule adopts revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on form k for years ending on or after december  the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
the amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
on january   the fasb issued asu  which aligns the fasb s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the sec s final rule 
we adopted the final rule and asu effective december  as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate 
such a change is accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance 
comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of asu and the final rule are not required 
our adoption of asu and the final rule on december  impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as follows all oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the year ended december  were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with prior periods 
this change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at december  using the updated reserves rules  which require use of the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates 
under the previous reserve estimation rules  which are no longer in effect  our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices 
in addition  the new rules permit us to disclose probable reserves and we have so disclosed probable reserves  which was not permitted under previous rules 
our full cost ceiling test calculations at december  used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves  which were calculated using the updated reserves rules 
we historically have applied a policy of using our year end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate 
as a result  the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or prior years 
due to the extent of our domestic and international oil and gas activities and the limited time interval allowed for preparing our annual report on form k  it was not practical to prepare estimates of oil and gas reserves using end of period prices and to generate discounted cash flow models for estimates of proved reserves using both the previous rules and the new rules 
therefore  it was not practical to quantify the volumetric impact of the change in reserves rules and methodology or the impact  if any  on our full cost ceiling test or depletion rate 
regulation exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations 
an overview of these regulations is set forth in items and  business and properties regulation 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  current regulatory requirements may change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered 
please see the discussion under the caption we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
in addition  potential regulatory actions could increase our costs and reduce our liquidity  delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business  in item a of this report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
we use hedging to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that counterparties  which generally are financial institutions  will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see information under the caption oil and gas hedging in item of this report and the discussion and tables in note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
interest rates at december   our debt was comprised of fixed variable rate debt rate debt in millions bank revolving credit facility senior notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due total debt million principal amount of our senior notes due is subject to an interest rate swap 
the swap provides for us to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments  and is designated as a fair value hedge of a portion of our outstanding senior notes 
on january   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due and received net proceeds of million 
these notes were issued at of par to yield 
we used million of the net proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  million to fund the acquisition of assets from txco resources inc and we tendered for approximately million of our outstanding senior notes due as a result  substantially all of our debt is at fixed rates as of february  foreign currency exchange rates the functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the us dollar 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flow  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
