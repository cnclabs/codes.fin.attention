item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we note these factors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
you should understand  however  that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the factors that are noted to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  we disclaim and do not undertake any obligations to update or revise publicly any of our forward looking statements  including forward looking statements in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k filed with or furnished to the sec 
item a 
risk factors the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business  prospects  financial condition  operating results or credit ratings  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the risks described below are not the only risks we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or risks that we currently consider immaterial  could also negatively affect our business  our results and operations 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results which could cause our financial results to be below expectations and cause our stock price to be volatile 
we have historically experienced  and may continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  and may result in volatility of our stock price 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand or lack of demand for our products  including demand that adversely affects our ability to optimize the use of our manufacturing facilities  the introduction and pricing of products competitive with ours  including generic competition  developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products  regulatory approvals for our products and pricing determinations with respect to our products  regulatory approvals for our and our competitor s manufacturing facilities  timing and levels of spending for research and development  sales and marketing  timing and levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our products  development or expansion of business infrastructure in new clinical and geographic markets  the acquisition of new products and companies  tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate  timing and recognition of certain research and development milestones and license fees  ability to control our costs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and economic and market instability 

table of contents we remain dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products revlimid  thalomid and vidaza and a significant decline in demand for or use of these products or our other commercially available products could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
during the next several years  the growth of our business will be largely dependent on the commercial success of revlimid  thalomid  and vidaza 
we cannot predict whether these or our other existing or new products will be accepted by regulators  physicians  patients and other key opinion leaders as effective drugs with certain advantages over existing or future therapies 
we are continuing to introduce our products in additional international markets and to obtain approvals for additional indications both in the united states and internationally 
a delay in gaining the requisite regulatory approvals for these markets or indications could negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our stock 
further  if unexpected adverse experiences are reported in connection with the use of our products  physician and patient comfort with the product could be undermined  the commercial success of such products could be adversely affected and the acceptance of our other products could be negatively impacted 
we are subject to adverse event reporting regulations that require us to report to the fda or similar bodies in other countries if our products are associated with a death or serious injury 
these adverse events  among others  could result in additional regulatory controls  such as the performance of costly post approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling  which could limit the indications or patient population for our products or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market 
similarly  the occurrence of serious adverse events known or suspected to be related to the products could negatively impact product sales 
for example  thalomid is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug during pregnancy could result in significant deformities in the baby 
revlimid is also considered fetal toxic and there are warnings against use of vidaza in pregnant women as well 
while we have restricted distribution systems for both thalomid and revlimid and we endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential known adverse events including pregnancy risks  we can not ensure that all such warnings and recommendations will be complied with or that adverse events resulting from non compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
it is necessary that our primary products achieve and maintain market acceptance as well as our other products including istodax  focalin xr and the ritalin family of drugs 
a number of factors may adversely impact the degree of market acceptance of our products  including the products efficacy  safety and advantages  if any  over competing products  as well as the reimbursement policies of third party payors  such as government and private insurance plans  patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects 
sales of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and reimbursement for our products by governmental and other third party payors is reduced or terminated 
sales of our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance  managed care  pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations  or reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other third party payors 
generally  in europe and other countries outside the united states  the government sponsored healthcare system is the primary payor of healthcare costs of patients 
these health care management organizations and third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
additionally  the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments  and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort 
the us government  state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs  including price controls  restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products 
the establishment of limitations on patient access to our drugs  adoption of price controls  and cost containment measures in new jurisdictions or programs  and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures  could adversely impact our business and our future results 
if these organizations and third party payors do not consider our products to be cost effective compared to other available therapies  they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our products or  if they do  the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis 

table of contents our ability to sell our products to hospitals in the united states depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations  or gpos 
many existing and potential customers for our products become members of gpos 
gpos negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts  sometimes on an exclusive basis  with medical supply manufacturers and distributors  and these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo s affiliated hospitals and other members 
if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo  affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products  and if the gpo has negotiated a strict sole source  market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer s products  we may be precluded from making sales to members of the gpo for the duration of the contractual arrangement 
our failure to renew contracts with gpos may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current or substantially similar terms 
if we are unable to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with gpos  our competitive position may suffer 
we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the united states 
international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations  and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in europe and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our pharmaceutical and medical device products 
although we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future cost containment measures or other potential legislative or regulatory developments  additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products  which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
if we do not gain or maintain regulatory approval of our products we will be unable to sell our current products and products in development 
changes in law  government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the discovery  preclinical development  clinical trials  manufacturing  risk evaluation and mitigation strategies such as our steps and revassist programs  marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive laws and regulations  including  without limitation  the us federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the us public health service act  medicare modernization act  food and drug administration amendments act  the us foreign corrupt practices act  the sherman antitrust act  patent laws  environmental laws  privacy laws and other federal and state statutes  including anti kickback  antitrust and false claims laws  as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions 
enforcement of and changes in laws  government regulations or policies can have a significant adverse impact on our ability to continue to commercialize our products or introduce new products to the market  which would adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents if we or our agents  contractors or collaborators are delayed in receiving  or are unable to obtain all  necessary governmental approvals  we will be unable to effectively market our products 
the testing  marketing and manufacturing of our products requires regulatory approval  including approval from the fda and  in some cases  from the environmental protection agency  or epa  or governmental authorities outside of the united states that perform roles similar to those of the fda and epa  including the ema  ec  the swissmedic  the tga and health canada 
certain of our pharmaceutical products  such as focalin  fall under the controlled substances act of that requires authorization by the us drug enforcement agency  or dea  of the us department of justice in order to handle and distribute these products 
the regulatory approval process presents a number of risks to us  principally in general  preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years  and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and the data obtained from these tests and trials can be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval  delays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process based upon the failure of the clinical or other data to demonstrate compliance with  or upon the failure of the product to meet  a regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality or  in the case of a product seeking an orphan drug indication  because another designee received approval first or receives approval of other labeled indications  requirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy  or the adoption of new regulations or legislation  the scope of any regulatory approval  when obtained  may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and reimbursed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings  precautions and contra indications that could materially affect the sales and profitability of the drug  approved products  as well as their manufacturers  are subject to continuing and ongoing review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to adhere to manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on their manufacture  sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market  regulatory authorities and agencies of the united states or foreign governments may promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our existing and proposed products  including specifically tailored risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  guidelines and recommendations published by various governmental and non governmental organizations can reduce the use of our products  once a product receives marketing approval  we may not market that product for broader or different applications  and the fda may not grant us approval with respect to separate product applications that represent extensions of our basic technology 
in addition  the fda may withdraw or modify existing approvals in a significant manner or promulgate additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products 
the fda may also request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our existing or proposed products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  products  such as revlimid  that are subject to accelerated approval can be subject to an expedited withdrawal if the post marketing study commitments are not completed with due diligence  the post marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to assure the safe use of the drug  or evidence demonstrates that the drug is not shown to be safe and effective under its conditions of use 
additionally  promotional materials for such products are subject to enhanced surveillance  including pre approval review of all promotional materials used within days following marketing approval and a requirement for the submissions days prior to initial dissemination of all promotional materials disseminated after days following marketing approval  and 
table of contents our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  labeling and promotional activities relating to our products as well as our post marketing activities are regulated by the fda  the federal trade commission  the united states department of justice  the dea  state regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory agencies and are subject to associated risks 
in addition  individual states  acting through their attorneys general  have become active as well  seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws 
if we fail to comply with regulations regarding the promotion and sale of our products  appropriate distribution of our products under our restricted distribution systems  prohibition on off label promotion and the promotion of unapproved products  such agencies may bring enforcement actions against us that could inhibit our commercial capabilities as well as result in significant penalties 
other matters that may be the subject of governmental or regulatory action which could adversely affect our business include changes in laws and regulations  including without limitation  patent  environmental  privacy  health care and competition laws  importation of prescription drugs from outside the us at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries  additional restrictions on interactions with healthcare professionals  and privacy restrictions that may limit our ability to share data from foreign jurisdictions 
we collect placentas and umbilical cord blood for our unrelated allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses 
the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research currently regulates human tissue or cells intended for transplantation  implantation  infusion or transfer to a human recipient under cfr parts and part requires cell and tissue establishments to screen and test donors  to prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and to register the establishment with fda 
this part also provides for inspection by the fda of cell and tissue establishments 
the fda recently announced that as of october   a bla will be required to distribute cord blood for unrelated allogeneic use 
currently  we are required to be  and are  licensed to operate in new york  new jersey  maryland and california 
if other states adopt similar licensing requirements  we would need to obtain such licenses to continue operating our stem cell banking businesses 
if we are delayed in receiving  or are unable to obtain at all  necessary licenses  we will be unable to provide services in those states and this could impact negatively on our revenues 
our products may face competition from lower cost generic or follow on products and providers of these products may be able to sell them at a substantially lower cost than us 
generic drug manufactures are seeking to compete with our drugs and will become an important challenge to us 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions including those related to our risk evaluation and mitigation strategies such as our steps and revassist programs 

table of contents furthermore  even if our patent applications  or those we have licensed in  are issued  our competitors may challenge the scope  validity or enforceability of such patents in court  requiring us to engage in complex  lengthy and costly litigation 
alternatively  our competitors may be able to design around our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology 
if any of our issued or licensed patents are infringed or challenged  we may not be successful in enforcing or defending our or our licensor s intellectual property rights and subsequently may not be able to develop or market the applicable product exclusively 
upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our products  or upon the at risk launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products  we can quickly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product  which can adversely affect our business 
in addition  if generic versions of our competitors branded products lose their market exclusivity  our patented products may face increased competition which can adversely affect our business 
the fda approval process allows for the approval of an anda or b application for a generic version of our approved products upon the expiration  through passage of time or successful legal challenge  of relevant patent or non patent exclusivity protection 
generic manufacturers pursuing anda approvals are not required to conduct costly and time consuming clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of their products  rather  they are permitted to rely on the innovator s data regarding safety and efficacy 
thus  generic manufacturers can sell their products at prices much lower than those charged by the innovative pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies who have incurred substantial expenses associated with the research and development of the drug product 
accordingly  while our products currently may retain certain regulatory and or patent exclusivity  our products are or will be subject to anda applications to the fda in light of the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the anda procedure includes provisions allowing generic manufacturers to challenge the effectiveness of the innovator s patent protection prior to the generic manufacturer actually commercializing their products the so called paragraph iv certification procedure 
in recent years  generic manufacturers have used paragraph iv certifications extensively to challenge the applicability of orange book listed patents on a wide array of innovative pharmaceuticals  and we expect this trend to continue and to implicate drug products with even relatively modest revenues 
during the exclusivity periods  the fda is generally prevented from granting effective approval of an anda 
upon the expiration of the applicable exclusivities  through passage of time or successful legal challenge  the fda may grant effective approval of an anda for a generic drug  or may accept reference to a previously protected nda in a b application 
further  upon such expiration event  the fda may require a generic competitor to participate in some form of risk management system which could include our participation as well 
depending upon the scope of the applicable exclusivities  any such approval could be limited to certain formulations and or indications claims  ie  those not covered by any outstanding exclusivities 
if an anda filer or a generic manufacturer were to receive approval to sell a generic or follow on version of one of our products  that product would become subject to increased competition and our revenues for that product would be adversely affected 

table of contents if we are not able to effectively compete our business will be adversely affected 
the pharmaceutical and biotech industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms  including  but not limited to takeda and johnson johnson  compete with revlimid and thalomid in the treatment of multiple myeloma and in clinical trials with our compounds  eisai co  ltd  supergen  inc and johnson johnson compete or may potentially compete with vidaza  amgen  which potentially competes with our tnf a and kinase inhibitors  astrazeneca plc  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our compounds and tnf a inhibitors  biogen idec inc and genzyme corporation  both of which are generally developing drugs that address the oncology and immunology markets  bristol myers squibb co  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our compounds and tnf a inhibitors  f 
hoffman la roche ltd  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our imids compounds and tnf a inhibitors  johnson johnson  which potentially competes with certain of our proprietary programs  including our oral anti inflammatory programs  novartis  which potentially competes with our compounds and kinase programs  and pfizer  which potentially competes in clinical trials with our kinase inhibitors 
many of these companies have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this enables them  among other things  to make greater research and development investments and spread their research and development costs  as well as their marketing and promotion costs  over a broader revenue base 
our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the fda  and other regulatory authorities 
we also experience competition from universities and other research institutions  and in some instances  we compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources 
the pharmaceutical industry has undergone  and is expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change  and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances in the field are made and become more widely known 
the development of products  including generics  or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are seeking to develop could cause the marketability of our products to stagnate or decline 
we may be required to modify our business practices  pay fines and significant expenses or experience losses due to governmental investigations or other litigation 
from time to time  we may be subject to governmental investigation or litigation on a variety of matters  including  without limitation  regulatory  intellectual property  product liability  antitrust  consumer  commercial  securities and employment litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that may arise from the conduct of our business as currently conducted or as conducted in the future 
in particular  we are subject to significant product liability risks as a result of the testing of our products in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval 
pharmaceutical companies involved in hatch waxman litigation are often subject to follow on lawsuits and governmental investigations  which may be costly and could result in lower priced generic products that are competitive with our products being introduced to the market 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we received a civil inquiry and demand from the federal trade commission ftc 
the ftc requested documents and other information relating to requests by generic companies to purchase our patented thalomid and revlimid brand drugs in order to evaluate whether there is reason to believe that we have engaged in unfair methods of competition 
we continue to cooperate with the ftc s request for information 
litigation and governmental investigations are inherently unpredictable and may result in rulings that are materially unfavorable to us  including a requirement that we pay significant damages  fines or penalties or prevent us from operating our business in a certain manner  cause us to change our business operations to avoid perceived risks associated with such litigation or investigations  have an adverse affect on our reputation and the demand for our products  and require the expenditure of significant time and resources  which may divert the attention of our management and interfere with the pursuit of our strategic objectives 
while we maintain insurance for certain risks  the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities 
it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all potential risks and liabilities 
if any litigation or governmental investigation were to have a material adverse result  there could be a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
see also legal proceedings contained in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
the development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process  and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we are currently developing 
many of our drug candidates are in the early or mid stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources  extensive research  development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale 
this process involves a high degree of risk and takes many years 
our product development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many reasons  including the failure of the product candidate in preclinical studies  adverse patient reactions to the product candidate or indications or other safety concerns  insufficient clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority of the product candidate  our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost efficient manner  our failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate  the facilities or the process used to manufacture the product candidate  or changes in the regulatory environment  including pricing and reimbursement  that make development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer desirable 
moreover  our commercially available products may require additional studies with respect to approved indications as well as new indications pending approval 
the stem cell products that we are developing through our cct subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional products and therapies which are now  or may be in the future  manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies 
furthermore  public attitudes may be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe  and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community 

table of contents due to the inherent uncertainty involved in conducting clinical studies  we can give no assurances that our studies will have a positive result or that we will receive regulatory approvals for our new products or new indications 
manufacturing and distribution risks including a disruption at certain of our manufacturing sites would significantly interrupt our production capabilities  which could result in significant product delays and adversely affect our results 
we have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our products and we have contracted with third party manufacturers and distributors to provide api  encapsulation  finishing services packaging and distribution services to meet our needs 
these risks include the possibility that our or our suppliers manufacturing processes could be partially or completely disrupted by a fire  natural disaster  terrorist attack  governmental action or military action 
in the case of a disruption  we may need to establish alternative manufacturing sources for these products 
this would likely lead to substantial production delays as we build or locate replacement facilities and seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
if this occurs  and our finished goods inventories are insufficient to meet demand  we may be unable to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis  if at all 
further  our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur and we would have to bear the additional cost of any disruption 
for these reasons  a significant disruptive event at certain of our manufacturing facilities or sites could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  if we fail to predict market demand for our products  we may be unable to sufficiently increase production capacity to satisfy demand or may incur costs associated with excess inventory that we manufacture 
in all the countries where we sell our products  governmental regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution and storing 
all of our suppliers of raw materials  contract manufacturers and distributors must comply with these regulations as applicable 
in the united states  the fda requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the united states achieve and maintain compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations and guidelines 
our failure to comply  or failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  disgorgement  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products 
in addition  before any product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped  it must conform to release specifications pre approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product 
if the operations of one or more of our manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason  any required fda review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products 
if our outside manufacturers do not meet our requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness  or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations  our ability to continue supplying such products at a level that meets demand could be adversely affected 
we have contracted with specialty distributors  to distribute thalomid  revlimid and vidaza in the united states 
if our distributors fail to perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time  we may experience adverse effects to our business and results of operations 
we are continuing to establish marketing and distribution capabilities in international markets with respect to our products 
at the same time  we are in the process of obtaining necessary governmental and regulatory approvals to sell our products in certain countries 
if we have not successfully completed and implemented adequate marketing and distribution support services upon our receipt of such approvals  our ability to effectively launch our products in these countries would be severely restricted 

table of contents the consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions could increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us 
we sell our pharmaceutical products in the united states primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted pharmacies 
these wholesale customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the united states 
this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation 
as a result  a smaller number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us 
in addition  wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee for service arrangements  and their purchases may exceed customer demand  resulting in reduced wholesaler purchases in later quarters 
we cannot assure you that we can manage these pressures or that wholesaler purchases will not decrease as a result of this potential excess buying 
risks from the improper conduct of employees  agents or contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation 
we cannot ensure that our compliance controls  policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees  agents  contractors or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including without limitation  employment  foreign corrupt practices  environmental  competition and privacy laws 
such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations  monetary and injunctive penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business  results of operations and reputation 
we may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we acquire and we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from any such acquisition 
achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of entities will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
our integration of these entities involves a number of risks  including  but not limited to demands on management related to the increase in our size after the acquisition  the diversion of management s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations  failure of the acquired entity to meet or exceed our expected returns  higher integration costs than anticipated  failure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings  difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees  difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices  as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations  and difficulties in the integration of departments  systems  including accounting systems  technologies  books and records  and procedures  as well as in maintaining uniform standards  controls including internal control over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related procedures and policies 

table of contents if we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses  we may experience material negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our failure to attract and retain key managerial  technical  scientific  selling and marketing personnel could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business depends  in large part  on our continued ability to i attract and retain highly qualified management  scientific  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel  ii successfully integrate large numbers of new employees into our corporate culture and iii develop and maintain important relationships with leading research and medical institutions and key distributors 
competition for these types of personnel and relationships is intense 
among other benefits  we use share based compensation to attract and retain personnel 
share based compensation accounting rules require us to recognize all share based compensation costs as expenses 
these or other factors could reduce the number of shares and options management and our board of directors grants under our incentive plan 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled personnel or maintain key relationships  or that the costs of retaining such personnel or maintaining such relationships will not materially increase 
we could be subject to significant liability as a result of risks associated with using hazardous materials in our business 
we use certain hazardous materials in our research  development  manufacturing and general business activities 
while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with the federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use of these materials  we cannot be certain that accidental injury or contamination will not occur 
if an accident or environmental discharge occurs  or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations  including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire  we could be liable for cleanup obligations  damages and fines 
this could result in substantial liabilities that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources 
additionally  the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future  requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage 
changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  the accounting for stock options and other share based compensation  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  changes in accounting standards  changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  the outcome of examinations by the internal revenue service and other jurisdictions  the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets  and changes in overall levels of pre tax earnings 
the impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have an impact on our results of operations 
currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 
we collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the us dollar 
therefore  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 

table of contents we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk  but not to engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions and balance sheet exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates 
the use of these derivative instruments mitigates the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost but may not fully offset any change in operating results that result from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting obligations 
as we continue to expand at a rapid pace  the development of new and or improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority 
during this expansion period  our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting 
such misstatements may result in litigation and or negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock 
the decline of global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations 
sales of our products are dependent  in large part  on reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers  distribution partners and other organizations 
as a result of the current global credit and financial market conditions  these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment 
in addition  us federal and state health authorities may reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements  and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales  revenue and cash flows 
due to the recent tightening of global credit  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators 
we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business  including portions of our product manufacturing  royalty revenue  clinical development of future collaboration products  conduct of clinical trials and raw materials 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business could be adversely affected 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you may lose some or all of your investment in us 
the market for our shares of common stock may be subject to disruptions that could cause volatility in its price 
in general  the current global economic crisis has caused substantial market volatility and instability

if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and accordingly  the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
chargebacks accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula

this amendment requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and will require a company to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities  any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement and how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the company s financial statements 
this amendment will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 measuring liabilities at fair value  or asu  which amends asc to provide clarification of a circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available 
a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following methods a valuation technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or b quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets and or a valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of asc asu also clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to adjust to include inputs relating to the existence of transfer restrictions on that liability 
the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosure  or asu  which provides additional guidance on using the net asset value per share  provided by an investee  when estimating the fair value of an alternate investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value and enhances the disclosures concerning these investments 
asu was effective for our interim and annual periods ending after december  in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
asu is effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer 
provisions for discounts  early payments  rebates  sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for volume based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale 
the estimated reductions to revenue for such volume based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms  historical experience and trend analysis 
we recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees sales of our products or products using our technologies 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectibility of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured  royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received 
gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances  sales discounts  government rebates  and chargebacks and distributor service fees 

table of contents thalomid is distributed in the united states under our steps program which we developed and is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk management distribution program with the objective of providing for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
internationally  thalomid is also distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of thalomid 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
revlimid is distributed in the united states primarily through contracted pharmacies under the revassist program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid 
internationally  revlimid is also distributed under mandatory risk management distribution programs tailored to meet local competent authorities specifications to help ensure the safe and appropriate distribution and use of revlimid 
these programs may vary by country and  depending upon the country and the design of the risk management program  the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies 
vidaza is distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain 
vidaza is not subjected to the same risk management distribution programs as thalomid and revlimid 
we base our sales returns allowance on estimated on hand retail hospital inventories  measured end customer demand as reported by third party sources  actual returns history and other factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains  as applicable 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
thalomid is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
revlimid is distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies  lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and  thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
sales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
government rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs 
us medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the medicaid unit rebate amount formula established by the center for medicaid and medicare services 
certain international markets have government sponsored programs that require rebates to be paid and accordingly the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales 
chargebacks are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare is a health care program of the us department of defense military health system that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel  military retirees and their dependents 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on estimated department of defense eligible sales multiplied by the tricare rebate formula 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the irs and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation the cost of share based compensation is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on the fair value of all awards granted  using the black scholes method of valuation 
the fair value of each award is determined and the compensation cost is recognized over the service period required to obtain full vesting 
compensation cost to be recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security  our intent not to sell and an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
derivatives and hedging activities all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and  if it is  the type of hedging transaction 
for a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period  we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item 
we assess  both at inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments  if any  to current earnings 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings 
we use derivative instruments  including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction  to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates 
the use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 

table of contents investment in affiliated companies we apply the equity method of accounting to our investments in common stock of affiliated companies and certain investment funds  which primarily invest in companies conducting business in life sciences such as biotechnology  pharmaceuticals  medical technology  medical devices  diagnostics and health and wellness 
equity investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment 
if an investment s fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances 
factors considered in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include market value or exit price of the investment based on either market quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee  length of time that the market value was below its cost basis  financial condition and business prospects of the investee  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment  issues that raise concerns about the investee s ability to continue as a going concern  and any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have three three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december   and performance measures for each ltip are based on the following components in the last year of the three year cycle on non gaap earnings per share  on non gaap net income and on total non gaap revenue  as defined 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the plans 
awards are payable in cash or  at our discretion  in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout date 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or an award based on actual performance  if higher  through the date of the change in control 
accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future non gaap earnings per share  non gaap net income and non gaap revenues  as defined  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals  management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 

table of contents valuation of acquired intangible assets and acquired in process research and development we have acquired intangible assets primarily through business combinations 
when identifiable intangible assets  including in process research and development  are acquired we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and is not amortized  but subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
we test our goodwill annually for impairment each november intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur 
we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale  our manufacturing facility note payable and certain foreign currency forward contracts 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted primarily of us treasury fixed rate securities  us government sponsored agency fixed rate securities  us government sponsored agency mortgage backed fixed rate securities  fdic guaranteed fixed rate corporate debt  non us government issued fixed rate securities  non us government guaranteed fixed rate securities and a marketable equity security 
us government sponsored agency securities include general unsecured obligations of the issuing agency  including issues from the federal home loan bank  or fhlb  federal national mortgage association  or fannie mae  and federal home loan mortgage corporation  or freddie mac 
us government sponsored agency mortgage backed securities include fixed rate asset backed securities issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and government national mortgage association  or ginnie mae 
federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  guaranteed corporate debt includes obligations of bank holding companies that meet certain criteria set forth under the federal temporary liquidity guarantee program  or tlgp  and is unconditionally guaranteed by the fdic 
fannie mae  freddie mac  fhlb and ginnie mae are regulated by the federal housing finance agency  or fhfa 
working with the congress and the office of the president  the us treasury and the federal reserve have pledged to continue to provide capital and liquidity to these us government sponsored agencies 
we have not recorded any impairment against our holdings in these securities due to the support of the us government of these agencies 
non us government issued securities consist of direct obligations of highly rated governments of nations other then the united states 
non us government guaranteed securities consist of obligations of agencies and other entities that are explicitly guaranteed by highly rated governments of nations other then the united states 
we have not recorded impairments against our holdings in these securities due to the support of the governments of these agencies and entities 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges  is included in interest and investment income  net 

table of contents as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows less than more than in thousands year to years to years years total principal amount fair value average interest rate note payable in december  we purchased an api manufacturing facility and certain other assets and liabilities from siegfried 
at december   the fair value of our note payable to siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of million see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the note 
the note is denominated in swiss francs and its fair value will also be affected by changes in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
the carrying value of the note reflects the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate and swiss interest rates 
foreign currency forward contracts we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to protect against changes in anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily associated with non functional currency denominated revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries 
the foreign currency forward hedging contracts outstanding at december  and had settlement dates within months 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under asc and  accordingly  to the extent effective  any unrealized gains or losses on them are reported in other comprehensive income loss  or oci  and reclassified to operations in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect operations 
any ineffectiveness on these foreign currency forward contracts is reported in other income  net 
foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses were as follows notional amount foreign currency euro the notional settlement amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december  and were billion and million  respectively 
we consider the impact of our own and the counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute its obligations under the contract 
as of december  and  credit risk did not materially change the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts 

table of contents we recognized reductions in net product sales for certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of million for and million for these settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted sales occurred 
we recognized an increase in research and development expenses for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of million for and a decrease in research and development expenses for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of million for these settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted research and development expenses occurred 
we recognized an increase in other income  net for the settlement of certain effective cash flow hedge instruments of million for the year ended december  these settlements were recorded in the same period as the related forecasted expenses occurred 
changes in time value  which we excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment  were included in other income  net 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain recognized assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges under asc and  accordingly  any changes in their fair value are recognized in other income  net in the current period 
the aggregate notional amount of the foreign currency forward non designated hedging contracts outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively 
although not predictive in nature  we believe a hypothetical threshold reflects a reasonably possible near term change in foreign currency rates 
assuming that the december  exchange rates were to change by a hypothetical  the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately million 
however  since the contracts either hedge specific forecasted intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies or hedge assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currencies  any change in the fair value of the contract would be either reported in other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to earnings in the same periods during which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings or remeasured through earnings each period along with the underlying hedged item
