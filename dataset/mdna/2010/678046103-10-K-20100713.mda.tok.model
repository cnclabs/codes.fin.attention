item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis presents management s perspective of our business  financial condition and overall performance 
this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance  current financial condition and outlook for the future 
our discussion and analysis relates to the following topics overview of business overview of results and outlook liquidity and capital resources changes in financial condition and results of operations share capital critical accounting policies contractual cash obligations overview of business we are a us public company based in calgary  alberta engaging in a variety of projects in the oil and gas sector and in particular the oil sands and oil shale sectors in western canada 
we are aggressively exploring canada s largest contiguous oil sands land holding  which is located in northeast alberta  northwest saskatchewan and oilsands quest is leading the development of an oil sands industry in the province of saskatchewan 
oilsands quest  together with its subsidiaries  is in the exploration and development stage and does not currently have any income from operating activities 
for a more detailed discussion of our business see part  item description of business 
overview of results and outlook during the year ended april   the company s activities included an exploration drilling program of holes on lands in the wallace creek area  core holes across axe lake reservoirs to improve the understanding of the overburden characteristics  a km d seismic program on the permits to the north and south of axe lake in saskatchewan and the advancement of its pre commercialization evaluation studies and reservoir test program on its axe lake discovery 
we also expanded our environmental program consisting of monitoring and baseline assessment studies in anticipation of comprehensive environmental impact assessment reports as part of the application for regulatory approval for development process in alberta and saskatchewan 
during the year ended april   we raised million  net of issuance costs  through a private placement share issuance  a marketed public offering and proceeds of option exercises to fund these activities and future programs 
operations summary exploration program in october  we released an updated independent engineering estimate of contingent  discovered and undiscovered resources which were prepared in accordance with the standards set out in cogeh and ni this resource estimate incorporates the results of our well drilling program at axe lake in late  and at raven ridge in early and updates the previous estimates provided in december which was based upon wells drilled up to mid we commenced an overburden characterization study in october and completed a hole coring and logging program that yielded core material and advanced logging data nmr  dipole  sonic and standard suite geophysical logs of the formation overlying the bitumen bearing mcmurray dina formation 
the cores have been analyzed by weatherford laboratories and results show that the overburden is composed of clay rich till  which is a dense  low permeability cap layer that demonstrates steam containment characteristics in laboratory and d reservoir computer simulations 
weatherford laboratories conducted a high temperature caprock study on the samples provided 
to date samples from the core holes wm  wm  wm and wm have been processed  and the laboratory work demonstrates that the permeabilities are lower than those indicated on the nmr logs  with a range of permeabilities from md at c 
when the samples are subjected to temperatures of c  a further decrease in permeability to the range of md is observed in the laboratory 
the core samples are also being correlated with previously drilled exploration core holes and with our extensive axe lake and raven ridge d seismic data sets to determine the extent and continuity of this layer across the various reservoirs on both sides of the saskatchewan alberta border 
detailed evaluation of the continuity of the till layer using d seismic is currently underway 
based on the current data set it appears that the dense glacial till layer is present over a large majority of the potential commercial development area 
generally the dense glacial till layer lies directly on top of the oilsands reservoir zone  however in some areas there is several meters of top water between the oilsands zone and the glacial till 
the impact of these zones is being studied and the results will be incorporated into our commercial development plan 
in december  we completed a km d seismic program on the permits to the north and south of axe lake in saskatchewan which will further our geological knowledge of the deposits and has allowed us to meet work commitments required to extend the exploration permits until may  in march  we completed a hole exploration drilling program in the western township corner of the wallace creek permits that are immediately adjacent to cenovus borealis project area 
of the wells drilled encountered significant quantities of bitumen with one well intercepting up to meters of oil sand in the mcmurray dina formation 
we are also continuing with the additional processing and interpretation of the  kilometres  miles of d and d seismic data collected and initially processed in the winter program 
this interpretation is proving valuable in planning for the specific reservoir tests this year and in assessing the geological structures across our permits

axe lake discovery reservoir development activities at test site  we successfully commissioned the electrical  mechanical and boiler facilities and performed steam and water injection and tracer tests 
inter well communication was positively confirmed by measurement of substantial percentages of saline tracer at the producer wells 
we have analyzed the results from the circulation and tracer tests and history matched the field results in the computer simulations 
the next phase of testing  subject to regulatory approvals  will include the drilling of a new sagd well pair in close proximity to the existing wells at test site to build on our growing knowledge of the reservoir and cap rock characteristics and test the commercial viability of sagd at axe lake 
the addition of sagd wells to our testing plan will enable us to build upon the testing we have done to date and will en able us to test a bitumen production technology sagd that has been proven to be commercially viable in similar reservoirs in the athabasca basin 
in october of  we perforated the two vertical wells at test site  which are approximately meters apart  and installed temporary water  heating and injection facilities 
we commenced injecting cold water at low pressure and volume into the base of the mcmurray dina formation on october  and established communication between the two wells 
cold water circulation was maintained for hours  following which heated water was circulated  resulting in the mobilization of bitumen in the reservoir 
on october   a small amount of naphtha was injected and bitumen recovery commenced on october  we continued to circulate hot water until november   at which time the test equipment was removed 
we have filed two key regulatory submissions to advance the development of our axe lake oil sands project 
the first is a proposal to the sme for approval to produce up to  barrels per day of bitumen using sagd technology 
the second submission is for approval of a sagd pilot to confirm the containment characteristics of the glacial till overlying the axe lake reservoir and to determine the operating parameters of a commercial sagd project 
abandonment and reclamation costs we are responsible for compliance with terms and conditions of environmental and regulatory approvals and all laws and regulations regarding the abandonment of a project and reclamation of its lands at the end of its economic life  which abandonment and reclamation costs may be substantial 
a breach of such legislation and or regulations may result in the issuance of remedial orders  the suspension of approvals  or the imposition of fines and penalties  including an order for cessation of operations at the site until satisfactory remedies are made 
as at april   we estimate the total undiscounted inflation adjusted amount required to settle the asset retirement obligations in respect of the company s wells and facilities is approximately million 
this estimate includes the cost to re abandon a number of wells at axe l ake from the company s early exploration corehole well programs 
during a review of our development plans and well licenses  we determined that a number of these wells were not abandoned to meet our thermal development requirements 
we are also evaluating the wells that are located outside the potential commercial development area and have included a portion of these costs in the re abandonment liability based on a probability of performing the obligation over a year period 
the abandonment and reclamation estimate also includes the costs to reclaim the air strip  camp site  access roads and reservoir test sites which are being brought into income over a period of to years 
the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value  with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to property and equipment or exploration expense 
currently  the company is working with the regulators to assess an issue relating to the re abandonment of early exploration coreholes 
it is possible that the outcome of such assessment could result in cancellation of the permits if the company does not comply with the governing regulations 
further  if the company cannot remediate these coreholes to industry standards  our ability to commercially develop the axe lake reservoir may be limited 
liquidity and capital resources at april   the company held cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totalling million april  million 
on may   the company issued  units at a price of per unit for gross proceeds of million 
the units were issued as part of a public offering and were comprised of a share of the common stock and one half of a warrant to purchase a share of common stock 
the company paid an aggregate of million in fees to a syndicate of agents under the terms of the agency agreement and million of legal fees and other expenses in relation to the offering  of which million were incurred prior to may  on december   the company issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million pursuant to a non brokered private placement offering 
during the year ended april   the company expended million on operating activities and million on property and equipment 
on may   the company issued million flow through shares at cdn usd and million common shares at per share for gross proceeds of million pursuant to a non brokered private placement 
we believe that we have sufficient funds to maintain our interest in the existing properties and maintain other core activities over the next twelve months 
if we accelerate commercial development at axe lake or any of our other prospects  our cash requirements will increase significantly 
additional funding may also be required if our current planned activities are changed in scope or if actual costs differ from estimates of current plans 
we believe the company will have access to sufficient funding and sources of capital for its planned activities to april  because we constantly and actively monitor our expenditure budgets  if sufficient funding is not available we can adjust our expenditure plans based on available cash 
we plan to fund future operations by way of financing  including a public offering or privat e placement of equity or debt securities 
our development strategy also includes considering partners on a joint venture basis on our specific projects to fund the development of such projects in a timely and responsible manner 
however  there is no assurance that debt or equity financing or joint venture partner arrangements will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  to meet these requirements 
the company has no revenues  and its operating results  profitability and the future rate of growth depend solely on management s ability to successfully implement the business plans and on the ability to raise further funding 
the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
