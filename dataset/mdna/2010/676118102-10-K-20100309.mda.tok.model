based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery of high value shipwrecks such as hms sussex or successful admiralty proceedings regarding salvage claims to black swan high value cargo and thus a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in our ability to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing high value shipwrecks and our ability to generate expedition charter revenue 
our current estimates do not include monetizing any assets from the black swan or hms victory projects in we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period

bluewater  an australian company with licenses for mineral exploration of approximately  square kilometers of ocean floor in four different countries in the south pacific 
the focus will be on the exploration and monetization of gold and copper rich seafloor massive sulfide sms deposits through a new business entity which will acquire the remaining interest in bluewater 
smm will merge into this new business entity 
it is anticipated that odyssey will dedicate certain marine assets  including a ship and related marine exploration technology to the endeavor  and will own approximately of the new business entity

table of contents on february   we issued  shares of common stock to one institutional investor 
the shares of common stock were issued upon conversion of  outstanding shares of our series d convertible preferred stock that was originally purchased in january robert fraser marine ltd projects in november  we entered into agreements to provide project research and shipwreck search and survey services for a project code named enigma to robert fraser marine ltd and client companies of robert fraser partners llp 
under the agreements  odyssey furnished research related to the enigma and its sinking and will provide a research vessel  equipment and crew to search a specified area and inspect targets in that area 
the contracts provided initial cash payments totaling million approximately million to odyssey as well as additional payments upon the sale of coins or artifacts from the enigma project 
after repayment of salvage costs and fees  odyssey will receive of net revenue in aggregate until an additional approximately million has been received and then in aggregate of all further net revenue 
in february  we entered into a letter of intent with robert fraser partners llp to execute a series of deep ocean projects in based on the model of the earlier announced project code named enigma 
under the proposed structure  odyssey will be compensated for search  survey and archaeological excavation as well as development of research files on specific shipwreck and other deep ocean projects 
odyssey will also have a substantial interest in the back end of each project  if any  and will be compensated for providing other services including conservation  documentation  marketing and sales of recovered cargoes and commodities 
it is anticipated that a minimum of six deep ocean projects will be initiated in barring unforeseen circumstances  we believe these projects will generate cash of approximately million in bank credit facility we recently received a day extension on the million fifth third bank credit facility  which was initially scheduled to terminate on february  we are currently in negotiations with fifth third bank and expect to renew the credit facility prior to that time 
trends and uncertainties our current business plan estimates our net cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures will approximate million 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our cash position will be sufficient to fund operating cash flows throughout the rest of taking into account our recent capital raise and expected revenues from multiple sources  including projected sales and syndicated projects 
based upon current discussions with fifth third bank  we expect to renew our existing credit facility before termination in may however  we cannot be assured of our ability to do so and may need to seek additional capital in to pay off our existing balance 
we have experienced several years of net losses  and our current working capital position was a negative million at year end before the million capital raise 
our capacity to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing high value shipwrecks 
while we have recovered more than tons of silver coins and hundreds of gold coins and other artifacts from the black swan project  we will not have the ability to immediately monetize any recovered cargo until we are awarded title or a salvage award by the us district court 
at the present time  we cannot determine how long that process may take 
there is no certainty we will ultimately received a salvage award from the us district court 
we have also identified one of our potential high value target shipwrecks  hms victory 
however  until we have an agreement with the uk government  we may not be able to begin recovery operations or monetize any potential cargo in the short term 
if cash flow is not sufficient to meet our projected business plan requirements  we will be required to raise additional capital or curtail expenses 
while we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past  there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so

the new credit facility has a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate plus fifty basis points  requires monthly payments of interest only and is due in full february  we are required to pay the bank an unused line fee commencing in the second year of the agreement equal to per annum of the unused portion of the credit line  payable quarterly 
the line of credit was initially secured by approximately  coins recovered from the ss republic shipwreck  which amount will be reduced over the term by the amount of coins sold 
the borrowing base is equal to thirty percent of the eligible coin inventory valued on a rolling twelve month wholesale average value 
we are required to comply with a number of customary covenants and intend to use the line of credit as a means to fund ongoing operations as necessary

indemnification provisions under our bylaws and certain consulting agreements  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events arising as a result of the officer s or director s serving in such capacity 
separate agreements may provide indemnification after term of service 
john c 
morris  a former officer and director  has indemnification extended during the term of his consulting agreement 
the term of the indemnification agreement is as long as the officer or director remains in the employment of the company 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  our director and officer liability insurance policy limits its exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and no liabilities are recorded for these agreements as of december  critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations
