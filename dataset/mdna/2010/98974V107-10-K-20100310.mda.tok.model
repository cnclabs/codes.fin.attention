item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not intend to update any information contained in these forward looking statements 
overview general we are a leading full service residential real estate brokerage that uses an innovative combination of a comprehensive online presence  robust proprietary technology and knowledgeable local agents in the field to offer our clients fast  responsive and transparent service 
our award winning  user friendly website gives our users access to comprehensive local multiple listing services home listings data  as well as other relevant market and neighborhood information and tools 
our proprietary technology  including our agent productivity platform  helps us to increase agent efficiency and reduce costs  allowing us to pass on significant savings to consumers as permitted by law 
we have grown our business rapidly since our inception in by  we ranked as the th largest residential real estate brokerage in the nation by annual transaction volume  accordingly to real trends 
also in  our website received more traffic than any other residential real estate brokerage in the nation  according to hitwise 
as of march   we had wholly owned operations in major markets serviced by our team of over  local  licensed sales agents  and we had approximately million active registered users who had accessed our website within the last year 
all of our markets were opened prior to with the exception of portland  which we opened in april depending on market conditions and other criteria  we may consider entering additional markets in the future 
we typically share a portion of our commissions with our buyer clients in the form of a cash rebate  and typically represent our seller clients at fees below those offered by most traditional brokerage companies in our markets 
generally  our seller clients pay a total brokerage fee of to of the transaction value  of which to is paid to agents representing buyers 
in the oregon portion of our portland market which serves portions of both oregon and washington  the payment of cash rebates is not currently permitted by law  so we have adjusted our value proposition for our buyer clients by offering an enhanced client satisfaction guarantee 
in new jersey  the payment of cash rebates became permissible in january  and accordingly we have commenced offering cash rebates to our buyer clients in new jersey 
our agents are typically employees 
however  in february  we ceased to employ agents in new york  and instead engaged agents as independent contractors in that state 
through that modified business model  we hope to deliver excellent customer service and enable independent contractor agents to be productive and efficient with minimal management oversight 
we currently do not have plans to make a similar change in other markets  although we continually evaluate all aspects of our business and operational model and could make similar or different changes in other markets in the future 
our net revenues are composed primarily of commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions  and we operate in one reportable segment 
we record commission revenues net of any rebate or  in new jersey  net of charitable donation through april   or commission discount or transaction fee adjustment 
our net revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions we close and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission we receive on each transaction and varies significantly by market 
we also receive revenues from certain marketing arrangements  such as with mortgage lenders to whom we provide access through the mortgage center on our website  who typically pay us a flat monthly fee that is established on a 
table of contents periodic basis  as well as from relationships with advertisers 
for example  in the second quarter of we entered into a marketing agreement with bank of america and completed the implementation of that agreement in all of our markets during the third quarter of generally  non commission revenues represent less than of our net revenues during any period 
we routinely explore our options for entering into additional marketing and other business arrangements for offering other services related to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home 
we believe that customer acquisition is one of our core competencies  and although the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient number of leads online could increase over time  we expect that we can mitigate some of that impact with repeat and referral business  as well as by increasing our visibility and credibility to potential clients over time 
because our aggregate transaction volume market share in our markets has averaged less than historically  we believe that there is an opportunity to increase our market share and grow our business  even if the overall level of sales continue to decline due to macroeconomic conditions 
market conditions and trends in our business macroeconomic forces 
for the past few years  the residential real estate market has been negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions 
we perceive that conditions such as tight lending criteria  record numbers of foreclosures which  according to realtytrac  an online marketplace for foreclosure properties  reached their highest levels of all time during the third quarter of  and high unemployment continue to exert negative pressure on the residential real estate market  and may continue to do so for some time 
although the federal government  state governments and related agencies have acted repeatedly to address the decline in the residential real estate market and the availability of home mortgage credit  there can be no assurance that these activities will have a positive and meaningful impact 
looking ahead into  we currently believe that the health of the residential housing market will be significantly affected by the availability of credit  shadow inventory levels  and interest rates  all of which could be negatively impacted by high unemployment levels 
current residential real estate market conditions 
the residential real estate market remains volatile and unpredictable both nationally and regionally 
while home sales in the fourth quarter of improved in all major regions of the country  bolstered by tax credits and historically low interest rates  home sales prices continued to decline nationally  as did the inventory of homes available for sale 
federal tax credit programs designed to encourage home buyers have been extended into  but the expiration of these programs  and any future rise in interest rates in keeping with our current expectations  could deter future home buyers 
current indicators of national market conditions include the following volume according to the national association of realtors  or nar  existing home sales for the fourth quarter of rose from the third quarter of and from the fourth quarter of  with sales rising above prior quarter and prior year levels in all major regions of the country 
the increased demand for housing appears to have been fueled by a federal tax credit program for first time homebuyers that had been set to expire on november   please see discussion below under fluctuations in quarterly profitability 
in addition  home buyers were also bolstered by low mortgage rates 
according to freddie mac  the national average commitment rate for a year conventional fixed rate mortgage reached a record low in the fourth quarter of price according to nar  the median existing home sales price in the fourth quarter of was lower than in the fourth quarter of however  the year over year decline in price continued to slow from previous periods  and the median existing home sales price in december actually rose from the prior year period  representing the first year over year price increase since august we believe that some of this price stabilization was caused by a shift in the transaction mix away from distressed properties  as discussed below  and any future shift in the transaction mix back towards distressed properties could have a negative impact on prices 
in addition  we perceive that overall prices continue to be negatively impacted by the tight lending criteria for non conforming jumbo loans and the resulting constriction of the market for higher priced homes 

table of contents inventory according to nar  in the fourth quarter of  the total inventory of homes available for sale continued its month decline 
in december  inventory decreased by from december and reached its lowest level since march there is some evidence that this decrease may have been caused  in part  by changes in foreclosure practices that have resulted in shadow inventory  discussed below 
as discussed below  we expect that more distressed properties may enter the market in  which should increase inventory levels 
distressed properties currently  a significant percentage of our sales transaction volume is composed of distressed properties 
distressed properties are homes that are in foreclosure  are bank owned or reo  or are short sales  meaning a sale where the sale price is less than the loans or debt secured by the home listed for sale 
in the fourth quarter of  the percentage of our sales transactions composed of distressed properties was approximately 
this result was substantially less than the peak of realized in the first quarter of however  we currently expect that this percentage may rise again in in particular  we believe that more distressed properties may enter the market as mortgage rates reset and as banks step up their efforts to sell their swelling pipeline of shadow inventory  as discussed below 
distressed properties not only tend to sell at reduced prices  but they also tend to put downward pressure on the values of other homes for sale in the same and nearby neighborhoods 
we expect distressed properties to continue to represent a significant portion of the residential real estate market and of our business in the foreseeable future 
shadow inventory shadow inventory refers to distressed and other properties that have not yet been listed for sale  as well as properties that homeowners wish to sell  but will not sell at current market prices 
shadow inventory can occur when lenders put reo properties properties that have been foreclosed or forfeited to lenders on the market gradually  rather than all at once  or delay the foreclosure process 
they may choose to do so because of regulations and foreclosure moratoriums  because of the additional costs and resources required to process and sell foreclosed properties  or because they want to avoid depressing housing prices further by putting many distressed properties up for sale at the same time 
this shadow inventory could dampen and delay the recovery of the residential real estate market as it is introduced into the market in future periods 
it is difficult to assess the current volume of shadow inventory and its future impact on the residential real estate market 
recently  we have perceived a change in the handling by banks of distressed properties  whereby banks appear to be pursuing more short sales to avoid the foreclosure process 
we believe this trend will continue through at least the remainder of due  in part  to the federal home affordable foreclosure alternatives program  or hafa  which is currently scheduled to run from april  through the end of this year 
hafa was designed to promote the use of short sales instead of foreclosures for certain borrowers by offering incentives to lenders and by streamlining the short sale process 
if this trend towards short sales continues it should help reduce the backlog of shadow inventory as homes are introduced for sale on the market and become true inventory 
fluctuations in quarterly profitability 
we have experienced fluctuations in profitability from period to period 
our profitability has been impacted by various factors including seasonality  new market expansion  legal settlements  government activism and ongoing market challenges  including the tightening in the availability of home mortgage credit 
for example  in  the federal government introduced a program to provide a tax credit of up to  to first time home buyers  meaning  for this purpose  buyers who had not owned a home in the preceding three years 
that program had been set to expire on november  we believe many first time home buyers chose to accelerate their home purchases to take advantage of the credit before it expired  which bolstered our sales volume in november and its preceding months  but which cost us sales that otherwise would have closed in december or later 
in november  before the tax credit program expired  the federal government extended and expanded the program 
in its current form  the program offers a credit of  to first time home buyers and up to 
table of contents to repeat home buyers who have lived in their current home for five consecutive years in the past eight years 
to take advantage of the current program  buyers must enter into a home purchase contract by april   and complete the purchase by june  once again  we expect that this program will have a positive effect on our home sales volume in the first half of  but will result in fewer sales than we otherwise would have closed in the second half of  unless the program is extended or replaced 
in addition  we expect that the program will be less effective in regions where income levels and home prices are relatively high  given that the size of the tax credit is phased out as income increases  and that the credit is not available when the home purchase price exceeds  industry seasonality and cyclicality 
the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume nationally tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  then gradually slows over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing for traditional home purchases 
for non traditional sales  the time lag from contract execution to closing can be a few months 
we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
the impact of seasonality can be masked by the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time  whether affected by macroeconomic events  periodic business cycles or other factors 
generally  when economic times are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  if interest rates dramatically increase  if mortgage lending standards tighten  or if there are disturbances such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market likely would be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenues from commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we recognize commission revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate  commission discount or transaction fee adjustment  as evidenced when the escrow or similar account has closed and funds have been disbursed to all appropriate parties 
we recognize non commission revenues from our other business relationships  including marketing agreements  advertising  referral and other income  as the fees are earned from the other party 
we recognize revenue only when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  the transaction has been completed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs  including the development of our zipagent platform zap in accordance with the guidance set forth in the related accounting standards 
we capitalize internal costs consisting of payroll and direct payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software  as well as any external direct costs 
we amortize these costs over their estimated useful lives  which typically range between to months 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
the estimated life is based on management s judgment as to the product life cycle 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of accounting standards for share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases  based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates various assumptions including volatility  expected life and interest rates 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and consideration of other relevant factors such as the volatility of guideline companies 
the expected life of options is estimated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
we estimate expected forfeitures based on various factors including employee class and historical experience 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period adjusted for the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the accounting standard for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent historical results and our expectations for the future 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss carryforwards and we maintain that a full valuation allowance should be accounted for against our net deferred tax assets at december

our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of our net commission income from escrow companies or similar intermediaries in the real estate transaction closing process offset by cash payments for zipagent costs including commissions  payroll taxes  benefits  award programs and expense reimbursements  as well as for product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs including employee compensation  benefits  client acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
due to the structure of our commission arrangements  our accounts receivable are settled in cash on a short term basis and our accounts receivable balances at period end have historically been significantly less than one month s net revenues 
investing activities our investing activities provided cash of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided for the years ended december   and primarily represents the net proceeds from the sale and purchase of short term investments offset by the purchase of property and equipment  including amounts for website development and internal use software 
we typically maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and invest the remaining amount of our cash in investment grade  highly liquid interest bearing securities which allows for flexibility in the event our cash needs change 
due to current economic conditions we have retained proceeds from maturing short term investments in money market securities and as a result our cash and cash equivalent balances have increased by approximately million at december  from december  currently  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million primarily attributable to amounts capitalized for internal use software and website development as well as expenditures for increased server capacity and software 
in the future  our ability to make significant capital investments may depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to obtain adequate financing  if necessary and available 
financing activities our financing activities used cash in the amount of million and million and provided cash in the amount of million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash for the year ended december  represents primarily the repurchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the payment of withholding and payroll taxes due upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards

as of december   we had one warrant outstanding for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  that warrant is currently exercisable at the option of the holder and expires in future needs we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund cash used in our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of growth into new geographic markets  our level 
table of contents of investment in technology  advertising initiatives and possible repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  if the current macroeconomic environment and depressed state of the residential real estate market continues or worsens  we may have a greater need to fund our business by using our cash reserves  which could not continue indefinitely without our raising additional capital 
we routinely explore our options for offering services relating to the purchase  sale and ownership of a home  including services related to title insurance  escrow  mortgage  home warranty insurance and property and casualty insurance including auto insurance  which we refer to as core services 
we expect that some of our core services may be offered through affiliates including wholly owned subsidiaries  while others may be offered through joint ventures or promoted through marketing arrangements with independent third parties  such as title companies  banks and insurance companies 
we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we have no bank debt or line of credit facilities 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operations and results will likely suffer

non gaap measure the table below shows the trend of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands net revenue adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin we present adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we believe adjusted editda provides useful information regarding the operating results of our core business activity and prospects for the future 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss less interest 
table of contents income plus interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  stock based compensation and further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing core operating performance 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda to evaluate our financial results and business strategies  develop budgets  manage expenditures and as a factor in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash stock based compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges or credits resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective of our core ongoing operations  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial measures  including net income and our other gaap results 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most comparable gaap measure  net loss for the years ended december   and year ended december  reconciliation of non gaap adjusted ebitda to net income loss in thousands net loss add back interest income provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense non operating litigation recovery  net non gaap adjusted ebitda litigation for the year ended december  represents the recovery  net of legal fees  of approximately million from the settlement of a lawsuit we filed against a law firm that provided counsel in connection with certain employment matters in prior years partially offset by the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by a former zipagent in the amount of million 
litigation for the year ended december  represents the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by four former zipagents in the amount of approximately million 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
we believe this investment policy is prudent  and helps to reduce  but does not prevent  loss of principal  and results in minimal interest rate exposure on our investments 
as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and our short term investments consisted primarily of investment grade  highly liquid interest bearing securities 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities and short term investments are carried at fair value 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are fixed income investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  and  the increase or decline in fair market value of the portfolio would be approximately million and million  respectively 
there have not been any material changes in the past year to our primary market risk exposures  or how these exposures are managed 
exchange rate sensitivity we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as we do not have any sales  assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
