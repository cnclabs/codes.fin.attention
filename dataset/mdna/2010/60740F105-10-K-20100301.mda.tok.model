item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a  risk factors 
the following discussion takes into consideration our acquisition of mobile storage group on june  the operations of mobile storage group are included in our operating results for only six months of the twelve months ended december  there were no acquisitions consummated in additionally  in  the results of operations include four other acquisitions beyond mobile storage group we completed during the results of operations for also include four acquisitions and one start up location that we completed in executive summary was a challenging year for us globally with the economic recession still significantly impacting all aspects of business industries and consumers 
although our total revenue decreased approximately from the level  we continued to take the necessary measures in to keep the business right sized  primarily by further reducing headcount and reductions in other areas of non essential expenses 
these and other cost measures allowed us to increase our operating margin to of total revenues from in we continued to be cash flow positive after capital expenditures in in the third quarter of  we enacted a selective price increase focusing on customers who have had units out on rent for an extended period of time and those revenue benefits were realized in additionally  we did another selective rate increase in the second quarter of to date  we have observed no measurable difference in the attrition rates for the affected customers 

table of contents we are also investing in our business with the adoption of a hybrid sales model incorporating a local as well as centralized component  with both groups incentivized on the basis of performance 
the salespeople at the branches continue to be focused on large multi unit local customers that benefit from local service such as construction customers  while those in our new national sales center nsc in tempe  arizona are targeting our other customers  primarily non contractors 
while we have reduced salespeople at the branches and are hiring for the nsc  because of the expected efficiencies in our approach and team design of the nsc  this hybrid approach will result in a net salesperson headcount reduction 
a similar program is underway in europe 
the recession and credit crisis in the us and the us continued to curtail non residential construction activity throughout and we expect these factors to continue to negatively affect our consolidated revenues at least through the second quarter of in late  we restructured our manufacturing operations to reduce costs and implemented two rounds of company wide reductions which together resulted in cost savings in in addition to further headcount reductions we made in we continually monitor activity levels through a variety of metrics we use to find efficiencies in the number of drivers  dispatchers  managers  salespeople and corporate staff needed in the evolving business environment 
as a result  we have continued to reduce headcount in in areas where we believe we can find efficiencies without negatively impacting customer service and sales activity levels 
in  we continued to identify certain branch operations that we converted to operational yards which operate at a lower cost structure than traditional branches 
we monitor the effectiveness of our branches and where possible  we will continue to migrate some of our branches to operational yards in we believe these continued efforts  coupled with only nominal fleet purchases and maintenance expense  will allow us to continue to generate free cash flow in and pay down debt  which remains a top corporate priority 
we have reduced borrowings under our million asset based revolving credit facility from million at december  to million at december   leaving us with million of unused borrowing capacity under our facility 
this million in debt reduction was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates that effectively increased our borrowings on the line of credit by approximately million 
our senior notes do not contain financial maintenance covenants and the financial maintenance covenants under our revolving credit facility are not applicable unless we fall below million in borrowing availability 
at the same time we are reducing costs  we are increasing our internal efforts on sales growth to our core customers and have refocused our efforts to gain business through government projects at the federal  state and local levels 
we are doing this in part through increasing salesperson accountability through our disciplined sales processes which we believe has traditionally given us a significant competitive advantage 
general we are the world s leading provider of portable storage solutions  through a total lease fleet of more than  portable storage and mobile office units at december  we offer a wide range of portable storage products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as our patented locking systems  multiple doors  electrical wiring and shelving 
we derive most of our revenues from leasing of portable storage containers and mobile offices 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally sell mobile office units 
we also sell non core assets  in particular van trailers and timber units  when the opportunity arises 
our sales revenues as a percentage of total revenues represented of revenues in on june   we acquired the outstanding shares of mobile storage group through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini into mobile storage group s ultimate parent  msg wc holdings corp 
immediately thereafter  each of msg wc holdings corp 
and two of its direct subsidiaries merged with and into mobile mini and mobile storage group became a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini 
we refer to this transaction as the merger or the acquisition throughout this document 
the merger was the largest acquisition we have completed and it increased the scope of our operations in both the us and the us our consolidated statements of income for the reporting periods ended december  and  include certain estimated expenses expected to be incurred related to integration of the business acquired 
table of contents in the merger and restructuring charges related to restructuring of our manufacturing operations as a result of the merger 
prior to acquiring msg  mobile mini grew through both organic growth and smaller acquisitions  which we use to gain a presence in new markets 
typically  we enter a new market through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then apply our business model  which is usually much more customer service and marketing focused than the business we acquired or its competitors in the market 
if we cannot find a desirable acquisition opportunity in a market we wish to enter  we establish a new location from the ground up 
as a result  a new branch location will typically have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new branch  we take advantage of operating efficiencies to improve operating margins at the branch and typically reach company average levels after several years 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing an infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum levels of staffing and delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we generate high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level  contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  additional fixed expenses require us to achieve additional revenue in order to maintain our margins 
when we refer to our operating leverage in this discussion  we are describing the impact on margins once we either cover our fixed costs or if we incur additional fixed costs 
following the merger  we implemented our business model across the newly acquired msg branches 
while we realized significant cost reductions as a result of the combination of the two companies  costs of implementing our business model at the branches we acquired offset some of the cost reductions 
the level of non residential construction activity is an important external factor that we examine to determine the direction of our business 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately and of our units on rent at december  and december   respectively  and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  increases or decreases in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
in  after three years of very strong growth in non residential construction activity in the u 
s  this sector began to moderate and then decline and the level of our construction related business began to slow down and then decline 
this decline continued and adversely affected our results of operations in and we anticipate it will continue at least through the second quarter of in managing our business  we focus on growing leasing revenues  particularly in existing markets where we can take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
our goal is to maintain a stable operating margin and  after the economy returns to normalized conditions  a steady growth rate in leasing revenues 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring or extinguishment expense if applicable  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into and it provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to exclude the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 
for  adjusted ebitda does not include the integration  merger and restructuring expenses related to the msg acquisition and non core leasing expenses 
in managing our business  we measure our ebitda margins from year to year based on the size of the branch 
we define this margin as ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the startup costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low ebitda margins in its early years until the 
table of contents number of units on rent increases 
because this operating leverage creates higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent growth in leasing revenues  the ebitda margin at a branch will be expected to remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis if expenses remained the same or would decrease if fixed costs increased 
because ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures  as defined by the sec  we include in this annual report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these reconciliations are included in item  selected financial data 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units and mobile offices in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  remanufacture and modify used iso containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  real property lease expenses  commissions  repair and maintenance costs of our lease fleet and transportation equipment  stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
the steel units in our lease fleet other than van trailers are depreciated on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data  which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we also have other non core products that are added to our fleet as a result of acquisitions that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
see item business product lives and durability 
our expansion program and other factors can affect our overall lease fleet asset utilization rate 
during the last five fiscal years  our annual utilization levels averaged and ranged from a low of in to a high of in our utilization is somewhat seasonal  historically with the low normally being realized in the first quarter and the high realized in the fourth quarter 
however  with the challenging economic business environment  especially in the non residential construction industry  we have seen a decline in our utilization rates compared to the same period in the prior year 
we ended the year with an average lease fleet utilization rate of  compared to for 
table of contents results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of income  certain amounts may not add due to rounding year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses integration  merger and restructuring expense goodwill impairment depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income other income interest expense debt extinguishment expense foreign currency exchange income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary revenue focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease in leasing revenues resulted from a decrease in the average number of units on lease  and a decrease in yield 
yield was primarily driven by lower ancillary revenues and the mix of the type of units on lease  while the average rental rate per unit remained virtually unchanged 
in  decline in both leasing and sales revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in business activity level due to a continued decline in non residential construction activity and the economic recession 
our leasing revenues declined in the last two quarters of from the levels 
leasing revenues increased in the first two quarters of because the comparable quarters in excluded the msg merger 
our leasing revenue growth  or decline  rate in over the same period in the prior year was   and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
our revenues from the sale of units decreased million  or  to million in from million in other revenues are primarily related to transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products and represented of total revenues in both and cost of sales relate to our sales revenue and as a percentage of sales revenue decreased slightly to in from in  thus the gross profit margin on sales improved in over levels 

table of contents leasing  selling and general expenses decreased million  or to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
this slight increase as a percentage of revenues is due to a decline in leasing revenues  which were partially offset by the cost savings achieved in the million decrease in is the result of cost synergies achieved in the msg acquisition in addition to our cost cutting measures on the reduced revenue levels 
these cost cutting measures primarily involved reductions in our workforce and migrating a number of our branches to operational yards 
these operational yards do not have all the personnel and overhead expenses associated with a fully staffed branch 
the major decreases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were delivery and freight costs  including fuel  which decreased million  and were related to the pick up and delivery of containers by our drivers or third party vendors  which were used for the delivery of our units  mainly wood modular offices  payroll and related payroll costs  which decreased by million primarily in connection with reductions in our workforce  and repairs and maintenance expenses  which decreased million  and which includes the costs of repairing and maintaining our lease fleet as well as our delivery equipment  primarily our trucks  trailers and forklifts 
fixed costs for building and land leases for our locations  including real property taxes  increased million  due to the assumption of leases utilized by the locations added in the merger and contractual rate increases at many of these locations 
integration  merger and restructuring expenses for were million as compared to million in in  these costs primarily represent costs related to reductions to our work force and the repositioning of fleet to their intended location 
in  these costs primarily represented estimated costs for exiting targeted mobile mini branch operations that overlapped with mobile storage group s properties  repositioning and relocating assets to their intended location and other costs associated with personnel and office expenses associated with the integration of the companies 
also included in the expense was our estimated cost for restructuring our manufacturing operations including severance  related benefit costs and asset impairment charges for the disposal of manufacturing equipment and inventories that were not used in the restructured environment 
goodwill impairment in represented a non cash charge for a portion of our goodwill related to our uk and the netherlands operations 
there were no goodwill impairment charges recorded in see notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in this report for a more detailed discussion 
ebitda increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in and ebitda margins were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
adjusted ebitda was million in as compared to million in and adjusted ebitda margins were and of total revenues for and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the depreciation of units acquired through prior years acquisitions 
it also includes wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
depreciation expense also includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to support the lease fleet  and the customized erp  crm and other software systems to enhance our reporting environment 
depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of customer relationships and trade name valuation that were associated with the msg merger 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased only by million 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the million of debt we assumed in the merger 
although at the time of the merger  we assumed mobile storage s million of senior notes and our interest rate spread under our revolving credit facility increased from libor to libor  our average borrowing rate declined slightly in  due to lower prevailing libor rates 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for  excluding amortizations of debt issuance and other costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance and other costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for as compared to an annual effective tax rate of for our effective tax rate was negatively affected by the goodwill 
table of contents impairment charge of million related to our european operations which was not tax deductible 
our consolidated tax provision includes the expected tax rates for our operations in the us  canada  uk and the netherlands 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in our net income results were primarily achieved by maintaining our operating margins 
the year was negatively affected by the million million after tax  charge related to the integration  merger and restructuring expense 
the year was negatively affected by the million million after tax  charge related to the integration  merger and restructuring expense in addition to million after tax charge for goodwill impairment 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary revenue focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase in revenues resulted from a increase in the average number of units on lease as a result of the merger in june  offset by a decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and virtually no change in average rental yield per unit price 
in  our leasing revenue growth rate was as compared to in the increased growth rate in was due to the merger  but was offset in part by a reduction in business activity due to a decline in non residential construction activity and the economic recession 
our leasing revenue growth rate in over the same period in the prior year was    and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
our leasing revenues would have declined in the third and fourth quarters of without the msg merger 
as a result of the merger  we added new branches in branches in the us and in the us we also completed four smaller acquisitions in  three where we combined acquired businesses in cities in which we already had existing operations and one in hartford  connecticut 
our sales of units accounted for of total revenues in both and our revenues from the sale of units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is related to the higher level of sales activity at our newer locations both in the us and in the us added as a result of the msg merger 
other revenues are primarily related to transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products and represented approximately of total revenues in and in cost of sales relate to our sales revenue and as a percentage of sales revenue decreased slightly to in from in leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
this decrease as a percentage of revenues is due to the operating leverage associated with our leasing activities and in part  due to cost saving synergies related to the merger that we realized during the last two quarters of the increase in of million is primarily the result of the merger  as the majority of our leasing  selling and general expenses increase occurred during the third and fourth quarters 
the major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were payroll and related payroll costs  which increased by million primarily in connection with the additional locations such as staffing for branch managers  sales and office personnel and yard personnel  including drivers  fork lift operators and dispatchers  delivery and freight costs  which increased million related to the increased delivery and pick up of our rental fleet as well as the trucks we added at our newly acquired locations  and building and land lease costs for our locations  which increased million  including the assumption of leases utilized by the locations added in the merger and contractual rate increases at our existing locations 
the increased delivery and freight costs includes higher fuel costs  primarily during the first three quarters of  and an increase in third party vendors which we used for the delivery of our units  mainly wood modular offices 
part of the increased costs was passed on to our customers in the form of higher trucking rates 

table of contents integration  merger and restructuring expenses in represent the costs for exiting mobile mini branch operations that overlapped with msg s properties  repositioning and relocating assets to their intended location  and other integration costs associated with personnel and office expenses 
also included in this expense is our cost for restructuring our manufacturing operations and includes severance  related benefit costs and asset impairment charges for the disposal of manufacturing equipment and inventories that are not being used in the restructured environment 
goodwill impairment in represents a non cash charge for a portion of our goodwill related to our uk and the netherlands operations as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
ebitda increased million  or  to million in from million in ebitda in includes integration  merger and restructuring expenses of million and a charge for goodwill impairment of million  both as described above 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the increase in our lease fleet over the prior year including the depreciation of units acquired through acquisitions 
it also includes the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices  which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets which we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years  our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to our cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings 
in  we were cash flow positive after capital expenditures but excluding the merger for the first time in our operating history 
this positive cash flow continued in during the past three years  our capital expenditures and acquisitions have been funded by our operating cash flow  our senior notes offering in may  and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flow is generally weakest during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units and a result of seasonal weather in some of our markets 
during and  we significantly reduced our capital expenditures and were able to fund capital expenditures for our lease fleet and fixed assets with cash flow from operations 
we expect this trend to continue in in addition to cash flow generated by operations  our principal current source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility described below 
revolving credit facility 
in connection with the merger  we expanded our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing limit and to include the combined assets of both mobile mini and mobile storage group as security for the facility 
on june   we entered into an abl credit agreement the credit agreement with deutsche bank ag new york branch and the other lenders party thereto 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due on june  the obligations of mobile mini and our subsidiary guarantors under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets 
at december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and million of additional borrowing availability under the credit agreement  based upon borrowing base calculations as of such date 
we were in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december  amounts borrowed under the credit agreement and repaid during the term may be reborrowed 
outstanding amounts under the credit agreement will bear interest  at our option  at either i libor plus a defined margin  or ii the agent bank s prime rate plus a margin 
the applicable margins for each type of loan will range from to for libor loans and to for base rate loans depending upon our debt ratio  as defined in the agreement  at the measurement date 
based on our debt ratio at december   our applicable interest rate margins for libor loans will be libor plus and prime plus for base rate loans until the next measurement date which is the end of each fiscal quarter and becomes effective the month following management s communication to their lenders 
the credit agreement provides for uk borrowings  denominated in either pounds sterling or euros  by the company s subsidiary mobile mini uk limited  based upon a uk borrowing base and additionally supported by the us and canada borrowing base  if necessary 
for us borrowings  which are denominated in dollars  the borrowing base is based upon a us and canada borrowing base 
availability of borrowings under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible container fleet  eligible inventory including containers held for sale  work in process and raw materials  machinery and equipment and real property  each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit 
as of december   we had million of excess availability under the credit agreement 

table of contents the credit agreement does contain certain financial maintenance covenants  but these maintenance covenants are not applicable unless we have less than million in borrowing availability under the facility 
the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries  including covenants that restrict their ability to  among other things  i make capital expenditures in excess of defined limits  ii allow certain liens to attach to us or our subsidiary assets  iii repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities  or prepay certain indebtedness  iv incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions  and v make acquisitions or other investments 
we believe our cash provided by operating activities will provide for our normal capital needs for the next months 
if not  we have sufficient borrowings available under our revolving credit facility to meet any additional funding requirements 
we monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an on going basis using publicly available information 
based upon that information  we do not presently think that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders might not be able to honor its commitments under the credit agreement 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in as compared to million in and million in the million decrease in over in cash provided by operating activities resulted from a decrease in net income  after giving effect to non cash items  partially offset by a decrease in working capital 
in  there were decreases in receivables  inventories and deposits and prepaid expenses which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decreases are primarily due to the weakened economy  our restructured manufacturing operations and reduction of certain liabilities associated with the merger 
in  there were decreases in both inventories and deposits and prepaid expenses providing positive cash flows  which were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these decreases were primarily a result of the merger and the decrease in purchases of inventories due to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in late in  cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by debt restructuring expense  which included a million premium paid in connection with redeeming million of our senior notes  negatively impacted by increases in accounts receivable which was due to the general growth in our leasing activities by an increase in our sales activity related to our newly acquired european operations  and by an increase in deposits and prepaid expenses 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to net cash used of million in and million in in  we did not acquire any businesses  compared to cash payments for acquisitions of million in and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  provided net cash of million in compared to a use of cash of million in and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million and proceeds from sale of lease fleet units were million for  compared to net expenditures of million in our capital expenditures for our lease fleet decreased in compared to as we acquired fewer units due to the economic slowdown 
proceeds from sale of lease fleet units increased as compared to additions to the lease fleet primarily included remanufacturing of prior acquisition units and manufactured or purchased steel and wood offices 
during the past several years we have increased the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding wood mobile offices 
at the end of  we restructured our manufacturing operations to right size our manufacturing requirements considering the large lease fleet we acquired in the msg transaction 
as a result of the acquisition and the current economic conditions  we anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on remanufacturing units acquired in prior acquisitions to meet our lease fleet standards as these units are placed on rent 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from any sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were primarily for technology and communication improvements for our telephone  gps handheld devices and computer systems  delivery equipment and improvements to our branch locations 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
we have no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are 
table of contents required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information and communication systems 
our maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million in  million in and million in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to million in and net cash provided by financing activities of million in in  we reduced our net borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million and other net debt obligations of million in addition to redeeming million principal amount of senior notes 
in  we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million  which we used primarily to fund the merger  as well as other related expenses and costs associated with the credit agreement 
in connection with the merger we also assumed debt obligations  some requiring monthly installment payments 
in  we redeemed million principal amount of outstanding senior notes and completed an offering of million principal amount senior notes 
also in  under a common stock repurchase program  we redeemed million of our outstanding shares 
additionally  we received million  million and million from the exercises of employee stock options and the related tax benefits in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 
hedging activities 
at december   we had eight interest rate swap agreements in place to fix interest rates paid on a total of million of our outstanding debt 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate so that the rate is payable based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  and approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility are variable rate 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and million of senior notes  together with other  primarily unsecured notes payable obligations  and obligations under capital leases 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms typically ranging from to years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and office related equipment 
at december   primarily in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately million in letters of credit 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
historically  we entered into capitalized lease obligations from time to time and as a result of the merger  have commitments for million in remaining capital lease obligations 

table of contents the table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  the operating lease amounts include certain real estate leases that expire in  but have lease renewal options that we currently anticipate to exercise in at the end of the initial lease period

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventories 
table of contents for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
other than when in a challenging economic environment  this seasonality has caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the year 
over the last few years  we reduced the percentage of our units we reserve for this seasonal business from the levels we allocated in earlier years  decreasing our seasonality 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage and mobile office units are recognized on a straight line basis 
delivery and hauling revenues and expenses from our portable storage and mobile office units are recognized when these services are earned 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and mobile office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell our products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with our customers 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation using the modified prospective transition method and recognize the fair value of share based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our share based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we historically have not paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend rate 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in the past we have issued stock options and restricted stock  which we also refer to as nonvested shares 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
in the share based compensation expense was reduced by million to reflect anticipated shortfalls related to share awards with vesting subject to a performance conditions 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using accelerated attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share awards at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
we operate in one reportable segment  which is comprised of three operating segments that also represent our reporting units north america  the uk and the netherlands 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these three reporting units 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at december using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in addition  we will perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 
at december   we performed the first step of the two step impairment test and compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures  tax payments and discount rates 
each approach was given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
as of december   we determined the fair values of the uk and the netherlands reporting units were less than the carrying values of the net assets of these reporting units  thus we performed step two of the impairment test for these two reporting units 
as of december   neither of the reporting units with goodwill had estimated fair values less than their individual net asset carrying values  therefore step two was not required at december  in step two of the impairment test  we are required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
we allocated the fair value of the reporting units to the respective assets and liabilities of each reporting unit as if the reporting units had been acquired in separate and individual 
table of contents business combinations and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting units 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting units over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we reconciled the fair values of our three reporting units in the aggregate to our market capitalization at december  the performance of our annual impairment analyses resulted in no impairment charges to the north america or uk reporting units  where all of our goodwill is recorded 
the fair value of the north america and uk reporting units exceeded the carrying value at december  by and  respectively 
at december   million of our goodwill relates to the north america reporting unit and million relates to the uk reporting unit 
the discount rates utilized in the analyses ranged from to while the terminal growth rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis were approximately 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
we have other non core products that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
van trailers and other non core products are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
in april  we evaluated our depreciation policy on our steel units and changed the estimated useful life to years from years and decreased the residual value to from 
this results in continual depreciation on steel units for five additional years at the same annual rate of of book value 
this change had an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements at the date of the change in estimate 
we made this change because some of our steel units have been in our lease fleet longer than years and these units continue to be effective income producing assets that do not show signs of realizing the end of their useful life 
our historical lease fleet data on our steel units shows we have retained comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of the steel units in our lease fleet 

table of contents we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life on our steel units would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years in thousands except per share data as reported net income n a  diluted earnings per share n a as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share effective april prior to april insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance are purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 

table of contents contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 
deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
at december   we have a million valuation allowance and have million of deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of the deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations and  or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards codification 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc became the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the historical gaap hierarchy was eliminated and the asc became the only level of authoritative gaap  other than guidance issued by the sec 
the codification was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september   except for certain nonpublic nongovernmental entities 
our accounting policies were not affected by the conversion to asc 
fair value measurements 
in september  the fasb issued guidance which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued additional guidance which deferred the effective date for the company to january  for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
we adopted the deferred provisions of this guidance on january  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance for business combinations as issued by the fasb 
the new accounting guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an 
table of contents acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  as well as the goodwill acquired 
significant changes from previous guidance resulting from this new guidance include the expansion of the definitions of a business and a business combination 
for all business combinations whether partial  full or step acquisitions  the acquirer will record of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business  including goodwill  generally at their fair values  contingent consideration will be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and  for certain arrangements  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings until settlement  and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition 
the new accounting guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
because the majority of the provisions of the new accounting guidance are applicable to future transactions  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination as issued by the fasb 
the new guidance amends the provisions previously issued by the fasb related to the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
the new guidance eliminates the distinction between contractual and non contractual contingencies  including the initial recognition and measurement 
the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
determining the useful life of intangible assets 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance for the determination of the useful life of intangible assets as issued by the fasb 
the new guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the new guidance also requires expanded disclosure regarding the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
because this accounting guidance is applicable to future transactions  the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent events 
on april  we adopted new accounting guidance related to subsequent events as issued by the fasb 
the new requirement establishes the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
transfers of financial assets 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that changes the information a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about the transfer of financial assets and continuing interests held in transferred financial assets 
the standard amends previous accounting guidance by removing the concept of qualified special purpose entities 
this accounting standard is effective for the company for transfers occurring on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
fair value measurement of liabilities 
in august  fasb issued guidance providing clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques a valuation technique that uses a 
the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset 
b 
quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets 
another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles in the fasb s guidance two examples would be an income approach or a market approach 
this guidance also clarifies that i when estimating fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the 
table of contents transfer of the liability and ii both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when no adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
multiple element arrangements 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective for the company for arrangements entered into after january  we currently do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had eight interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on a notional amount of million of debt 
in  comprehensive income included million  net of income tax expense of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio total at total fair value at december  december  at december  thereafter in thousands  except percentages debt fixed rate average interest rate floating rate average interest rate operating leases included in our floating rate line of credit facility are million of fixed rate swap agreements with a weighted average interest rate of that mature in and impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we currently have branch operations outside the us and we bill those customers primarily in their local currency which is subject to foreign currency rate changes 
our operations in canada are billed in the canadian dollar  operations in the uk are billed in pound sterling and operations in the netherlands are billed in the euro 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non us operations are translated into us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant with our canadian operations  but we have more exposure to volatility with our european operations 
in order to help minimize our exchange rate gain and loss volatility  we finance our european entities through our revolving line of credit which allows us to also borrow those funds in pound sterling denominated debt
