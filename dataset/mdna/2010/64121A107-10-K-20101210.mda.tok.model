item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a system integrator 
we design and manufacture application platforms and appliance solutions on which software applications are applied to both enterprise and telecommunications networks 
we market our application platform solutions and services to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and independent software vendors  or isvs  that then deliver their software applications in the form of a network ready hardware or software platform 
we brand these platforms for our customers  who subsequently resell and support these platforms to organizations and enterprises 
application platforms are pre configured server based network infrastructure devices  engineered to deliver specific software application functionality  ease deployment challenges  improve integration and manageability  accelerate time to market and increase the security of that software application in an end user s network 
we also provide platform management software tools and support services related to solution design  integration control  global logistics  and support and maintenance programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery to customers if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
in the event we have unfulfilled future obligations  revenue and related costs are deferred until those future obligations are met 
we have an inventory consignment agreement with our largest customer related to certain application platforms 
this customer notifies us when it utilizes inventory and we recognize revenues from sales to this customer based upon these notifications 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with the initial application platform sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance fees are typically for one to three year renewable periods and include the right to hardware repairs  hour customer support  on site support  advanced replacement of application platforms  and unspecified software updates when and if available for certain agreements 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are included in deferred revenue 
the associated costs of maintenance are expensed in the same period as incurred 
contracts and or customer purchase orders generally serve as the evidence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and consignment usage notifications are used to verify shipment or transfer of ownership  as applicable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 

table of contents in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the authoritative guidance related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements 
we elected to early adopt this guidance on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after january   the start of the second fiscal quarter of our fiscal year under previous authoritative guidance  for revenue arrangements that contained multiple elements  such as the sale of both the product and post sales support and or extended warranty and related services element  in which software was not incidental to the product as a whole  we were required to determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe was established through contractual post sales support renewal rates 
we used the residual fair value method to allocate the arrangement consideration to the product 
for revenue arrangements that contained software elements that were not incidental to the product as a whole  and vsoe was not available for the undelivered elements  we deferred all revenue associated with the arrangement and recognized the revenue over the related service period 
under the amended authoritative guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements  we are required to determine if the software elements function together with the tangible product to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
we determined that our software elements provide additional functionality but are not necessary to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality  as such  we are required to allocate the arrangement consideration to the hardware and software elements based upon the relative selling price of the hardware and software deliverables 
our software elements consist of software and software maintenance 
revenue associated with the software is recognized upon delivery  when vsoe is available for the undelivered software maintenance 
revenue associated with the software maintenance is recognized over the term of the maintenance period  which is generally one year 
when vsoe is not available for the undelivered software maintenance  revenue associated with the software elements is deferred and recognized over the software maintenance period 
our hardware elements generally consist of an application platform and post sales support and or an extended warranty 
revenue associated with the application platform is recognized upon delivery 
we allocate revenue associated with the post sales support and or extended warranty based upon separately priced contractual rates for these elements 
revenue associated with the post sales support and or extended warranty is deferred and recognized over the support period  generally one to three years 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market value  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain of our customers include inventory protection provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
product warranty obligations we offer a standard warranty on our products that generally provides for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue and record warranty expense as a component of cost of revenues 

table of contents costs included in our standard warranty obligation include shipping  internal and external labor  and travel 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve 
although our application platform solutions primarily use standards based technologies  certain of our application platform solutions incorporate proprietary technologies  which may increase our risks related to product warranty obligations 
in the past we have experienced unexpected component failures in certain of our application platform solutions  which have required us to increase our product warranty accruals 
at the time any unexpected component failure arises  we assess the costs to repair any defects and record what we believe to be an appropriate warranty obligation based on the information available 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our product warranty obligations may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross margins 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize that cost as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date using an option pricing model 
such an option pricing model requires us to make judgments for certain assumptions used  in particular  the expected term of the option and the expected volatility over that term 
for stock options granted on or after january   we determined the expected term based on analysis of our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation behavior 
for stock options granted prior to january   we determined the expected term using the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the options  also known as the simplified method 
we have determined the expected volatility based on a weighted average of the historical volatility of the market price of our common stock 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  judgment is also required to estimate forfeitures of the awards based on the probability of employees completing the required service periods 
historical forfeitures are used as a starting point for developing our estimate of future forfeitures 
goodwill and intangible assets we review long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
factors that could lead to an impairment of acquired customer relationships include a worsening in customer attrition rates compared to historical attrition rates  or lower than initially anticipated cash flows associated with customer relationships 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated over the asset s remaining life 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on the excess of the carrying value over fair value 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
during the year ended september   we performed our annual impairment review  which required us to determine the fair value of the company as a whole since it is considered the reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated 
we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing industry accepted valuation techniques that included the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and a market multiple approach  which considered our market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
step one of this assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value 
in step two of the impairment analysis  we compared the 
table of contents implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined to be zero 
consequently  we determined that goodwill was fully impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended september  income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at september   we determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the resulting reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit 
to the extent that net operating losses  when realized  relate to stock option deductions of approximately million  the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable  for which we do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic conditions  accounts receivable aging trends and the payment terms we extend to our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may have to record additional allowances 
the allowance for bad debts can vary depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenues as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable  either through collection or write off

discussion of fiscal years and net revenues the increase in net revenues during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  was primarily the result of increased sales volume to some of our larger customers  in particular a high volume design win achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year with our largest customer  combined with lower overall sales volumes in the year ended september  due to the global economic downturn 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in non strategic  transactional revenues which we have transitioned away from during the year ended september  gross margin gross margin increased in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to increased sales volumes to our largest customer 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to changes in customer and product mix  which were impacted by a high volume design win achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year with our largest customer  which has gross margins as a percentage of revenues that are lower than historical levels 
the first shipments of product related to this business occurred and the related revenues were recognized during the three months ended december  and continued to ramp up during the year ended september  we have pursued such opportunities with lower gross margins in order to increase revenues and leverage those revenues over our existing infrastructure to improve operating margins 
in addition  certain planned price decreases with our largest customer on certain legacy products took effect during the year ended september  
table of contents operating expenses the most significant components of our operating expenses are research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses

compensation and related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount from at september  to at september  and an increase in variable compensation  which was directly related to the results of operations 
prototype and consulting and professional services expenses tend to fluctuate based on the status of our development projects which are in process at any given time 
although our application platform development strategy emphasizes the utilization of standard component technologies  which utilize off the shelf components  qualification of these platforms still requires prototype and consulting and professional services 
as 
table of contents such  we expect that prototype and consulting and professional services costs will continue to be variable and could fluctuate depending on the timing and magnitude of our development projects 
stock based compensation expense decreased primarily due to variations in the timing and fair values of stock options awarded in the current year and prior years  and the periods over which the expenses related to those awards have been recognized 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  and costs associated with our marketing programs  which include costs associated with our attendance at trade shows  public relations  product literature costs  web site enhancements  and travel

the decrease in compensation and related expenses was primarily attributed to a decrease in commission expense  as well as a decrease in headcount from at september  to at september  the decrease in commission expense was primarily due to changes in the metrics and targets we use to determine commission payouts  as well as the decrease in headcount 
the decrease in marketing programs was primarily attributed to decreases in market research  public relations  and trade show related expenses incurred during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   in an effort to manage operating expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  information technology and human resources personnel  professional services  which include legal  accounting  audit and tax fees  and director and officer insurance

the decrease in consulting and professional services was primarily attributed to a decrease in legal expenses incurred during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in legal expenses was primarily due to costs incurred during the year ended september  related to the acquisition dispute and arbitration associated with the acquisition of alliance systems 
the decrease in stock based compensation was primarily due to the fact that certain stock options granted in prior periods reached the end of their vesting periods during the year ended september  the decrease in other expenses was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  compensation and related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in variable compensation  which was directly related to the results of operations 
amortization of intangible asset amortization of the intangible asset decreased to million for the year ended september   as compared to million for the year ended september  amortization expense for the intangible asset decreases annually over its useful life to reflect the fact that the economic benefit expected to be received from the intangible asset declines over time 
settlement of acquisition dispute the acquisition of alliance systems was structured to include an adjustment to decrease the purchase price based on the net working capital of alliance systems as of october   as defined in the merger agreement  and therefore approximately million of the cash paid was contingently returnable to us and therefore previously recorded as contingently returnable acquisition consideration 
the former alliance systems shareholders disputed the amounts claimed by us under this provision of the merger agreement 
in september  we engaged in arbitration with the former alliance systems shareholders to resolve the disputed claims as provided for in the merger agreement 
in october  the arbitrator s decision was rendered 
as a result  approximately million of the contingently returnable consideration was returned to us from escrow funds on november   as such  this amount was recorded as refundable acquisition consideration in our consolidated balance sheet as of september  the  not returned to us was recorded as settlement of acquisition dispute in the fiscal year statement of operations 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net totaled  of expense for the year ended september  as compared to  of income for the year ended september  the change was primarily due to a decrease of  in interest income  primarily attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates on the cash balances held by us during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a  decrease in the foreign currency exchange loss incurred during the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  these gains and losses relate primarily to vat refunds receivable 
the refundable vat amounts  which we pay on products and services purchased from our contract manufacturer located in ireland and the netherlands  are denominated in euros 
provision for benefit from income taxes the benefit from income taxes recorded for the year ended september  of  was primarily related to estimated tax refunds associated with federal alternative minimum tax amt payments made in previous fiscal years 
the benefit of  was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of  recorded for the year ended september  for estimated state income tax liabilities 
there was no provision for income taxes for the year ended september  because we generated a taxable loss for the year 
discussion of fiscal years and net revenues net revenues decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to decreases in sales volumes to many of our customers as a result of the global economic downturn 
these decreases were partially offset by revenues generated from new customer wins secured during the year ended september  sales volumes also decreased in part due to the fact that some of our storage customers are using larger hard disk drives  enabling them to provide their customers with the same storage capacity with fewer appliances 
in addition  during fiscal year  we began transitioning away from some of our non strategic  transactional revenues to projects that are more in line with our business model 
gross margin gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to manufacturing costs remaining fairly constant from the prior year relative to the decrease in net revenues  changes in customer and product mix  and an increase in inventory write downs

average headcount was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year lower average headcount was primarily attributable to the completed integration of alliance systems 
the decrease in variable compensation was due to the decrease in net revenues and the results of operations during the year ended september  stock based compensation expense decreased primarily due to variations in the timing and fair values of stock options awarded in the current year and prior years  and the periods over which the expenses related to those awards have been recognized 
because prototype and consulting costs are largely project driven  we expect that these costs will be variable and could fluctuate depending on the timing and magnitude of our development projects

restructuring charge we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the fourth quarter of the year ended september   consisting of one time benefits associated with the termination of employees 
of the total charge recorded  million was included in accrued compensation as of september  and was fully paid during the first quarter of fiscal year impairment of goodwill we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of september  our assessment for impairment required us to determine the fair value of the company as a whole since it is considered the reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated 
we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing industry accepted valuation techniques that included the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and a market multiple approach  which considered our market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
these valuation techniques require significant judgments by management  including estimates and assumptions about our projected future operating results  discount rates  and long term growth rates 
our forecasts of future revenue were based on expected future growth from new as well as existing customers  and historical trends 
in addition  we considered the expected gross margins attainable in the future and the required level of operating expenses needed to conduct our business 
step one of our impairment assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value 
in step two of our impairment analysis  we compared the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined to be zero 
consequently  we determined that goodwill was fully impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended september  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net decreased to million for the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to net foreign currency exchange losses of  recorded for the year ended september   compared to net foreign currency exchange gains of  recorded during the year ended september  interest income decreased by  which was attributable to lower interest rates on the cash balances held by us during the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september

non cash adjustments to net income consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of million and stock based compensation of million 
of the million net changes in working capital  million was due to an increase in inventories and million was the result of an increase in accounts receivable  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred revenue 
the increases in inventories and accounts receivable were primarily related to increasing net revenues during the year ended september   in particular the ramping up of new business relating to our fiscal year design wins 
changes in working capital in all periods are also impacted by variations in the timing of cash receipts  cash disbursements  inventory receipts and invoicing to customers

non cash adjustments to net loss consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expense of million and stock based compensation of million 
of the million net changes in working capital  million resulted from a decrease in inventories 
the change in inventories was related to the depletion of inventories on hand and lower purchases during the year ended september   resulting from the downward trend in revenues  and efforts we undertook to minimize inventory quantities on hand

cash used in financing activities during the year ended september  consisted primarily of million of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this was partially offset by employee stock option exercises and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  which provided million of cash 
on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through a share repurchase program 
as authorized by the program  shares may be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  in a manner consistent with applicable securities laws and regulations 
this stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares  does not have an expiration date  and may be terminated at any time by our board of directors 
all repurchases are expected to be funded from our current cash balances or from cash generated from operations 
to facilitate repurchases of shares under this program  we have established rule b plans intended to comply with the requirements of rule b and rule b under the securities exchange act of a rule b plan permits the repurchase of shares by a company at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of company blackout periods  provided that the plan is adopted when the company is not aware of material non public information 
pursuant to the plan  a broker designated by us has the authority to repurchase shares  in accordance with the terms of the plan  without further direction from us 
the amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to the terms of the plan and market conditions 
upon the expiration of the first b plan on november   we suspended repurchases of our common stock 
we resumed the stock repurchase program on march  under a new b plan  as authorized by the board of directors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we engage in certain transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro 
these transactions may subject us to exchange rate risk based on fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which occur between the time such a transaction is recognized in our financial statements and the time that the transaction is settled 
however  based on the historical magnitudes and timing of such transactions  we do not believe we are subject to material exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
in the past  we have invested excess cash balances in cash equivalents and short term investments  and if we were to do so in the future  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
in addition  we believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
