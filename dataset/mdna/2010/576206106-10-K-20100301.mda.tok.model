item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  under the headings critical accounting estimates and assumptions  certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in md a 
we could be negatively impacted by the competitiveness of the markets in which we compete and declines in the market demand for coal 
we compete with coal producers in various regions of the united states and overseas for domestic and international sales 
continued domestic demand for our coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain primarily will depend upon coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric utility industry and the domestic steel industry 
consumption by the domestic utility industry is affected by the demand for electricity  environmental and other governmental regulations  technological developments and the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  including hydroelectric power 
consumption by the domestic steel industry is primarily affected by economic growth and the demand for steel used in construction as well as appliances and automobiles 
in recent years  the competitive environment for coal was impacted by sustained growth in a number of the largest markets in the world  including the united states  china  japan and india  where demand for both electricity and steel supported pricing for steam and metallurgical coal 
the economic stability of these markets has a significant effect on the demand for coal and the level of competition in supplying these markets 
the cost of ocean transportation and the value of the united states dollar in relation to foreign currencies significantly impact the relative attractiveness of our coal as we compete on price with other foreign coal producing sources 
during the last several years  the united states coal industry has experienced increased consolidation  which has contributed to the industry becoming more competitive 
increased competition by competing coal producers or producers of alternate fuels in the markets in which we serve could cause a decrease in demand and or pricing for our coal  adversely impacting our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
portions of our coal reserves possess quality characteristics that enable us to mine  process and market them as either metallurgical coal or high quality steam coal  depending on the prevailing conditions in the markets for metallurgical and steam coal 
a decline in the metallurgical market relative to the steam market could cause us to shift coal from the metallurgical market to the steam market  potentially reducing the price we could obtain for this coal and adversely impacting our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
demand for our coal depends on its price and quality and the cost of transporting it to our customers 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by mine operating costs and coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
the cost of mining the coal is influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher costs for labor including reserves for future costs associated with labor benefits and health care and capital costs including costs for mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems 
as of january   we operated active underground mines  including two which employ both room and pillar and longwall mining  and active surface mines  with highwall miners 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on our ability to compete with other energy sources and on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
conversely  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country or the world  including coal imported into the united states 
for instance  coal mines in the western united states could become an increasingly attractive source of coal to consumers in the eastern part of the united states if the costs of transporting coal from the west were significantly reduced and or rail capacity was increased 
a significant decline in coal prices in general could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our results are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal 
decreased demand for coal  both domestically and internationally  could cause spot prices and the prices we are able to negotiate on long term contracts to decline 
the lower prices could negatively affect our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable to increase productivity and or decrease costs in order to maintain our margins 
we depend on continued demand from our customers 
reduced demand from or the loss of our largest customers could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve projected revenue 
decreases in demand may result from  among other things  a reduction in consumption by the electric generation industry and or the steel industry  the availability of other sources of fuel at cheaper costs and a general slow down in the economy 
when our contracts with customers expire  there can be no assurance that the customers either will extend or enter into new long term contracts or  in the absence of long term contracts  that they will continue to purchase the same amount of coal as they have in the past or on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable as under existing arrangements 
in the event that a large customer account is lost or a long term contract is not renewed  profits could suffer if alternative buyers are not willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms 
there may be adverse changes in price  volume or terms of our existing coal supply agreements 
many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times 
these contracts may be adjusted based on inflation or deflation and or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal  such as taxes  fees  royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining  production  sale or use of coal 
in a limited number of contracts  failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract 
coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer for the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party 
most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as btu  sulfur content  ash content  grindability and ash fusion temperature 
failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties  including price adjustments  the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts 
our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are required by some of our customers to provide performance assurances for certain below market sales contracts 
contracts covering a significant portion of our contracted sales tons contain provisions that could require us to provide performance assurances if we experience a material adverse change or  under certain other contracts  if the customer believes our creditworthiness has become unsatisfactory 
generally  under such contracts  performance assurances are only required if the contract price per ton of coal is below the current market price of the coal 
in addition  we may from time to time enter into coal sale agreements that require a posting of collateral to the extent we are out of the money on the total contracted sales in excess of million as of december   no posting was required 
certain of the contracts limit the amount of performance assurance to a per ton amount in excess of the contract price  while others have no limit 
the performance assurances are generally provided by the posting of a letter of credit  cash collateral  other security  or a guaranty from a creditworthy guarantor 
as of december   we have not received any requests from any of our customers to provide performance assurances 
if we are required to post performance assurances on some or all of our contracts with performance assurances provisions  there could be a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our contracts and agreements 
at december   we had  million of total indebtedness outstanding  which represented of our total book capitalization 
we have significant debt  lease and royalty obligations 
our ability to satisfy debt service  lease and royalty obligations and to effect any refinancing of indebtedness will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that we serve as well as financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings  or other financings may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service  lease and royalty payment obligations or our other liquidity needs 
we also may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future under the terms of our million asset based loan credit facility abl facility or by other means 
our abl facility provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million  of which million was available as of december  the addition of new debt to our current debt levels could increase the related risks that we now face 
our relative amount of debt could have material consequences to our business  including  but not limited to i making it more difficult to satisfy debt covenants and debt service  lease payments and other obligations  ii making it more difficult to pay quarterly dividends as we have in the past  iii increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  iv limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  v reducing the availability of cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  vi limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the business and the industry in which we compete  or vii placing us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors with relatively lower amounts of debt 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our debt payment obligations 
the covenants in our credit facility and the indentures governing debt instruments impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our abl facility contains a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  increase common stock dividends above specified levels  make loans and investments  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  engage in affiliate transactions  create any lien or security interest in any real property or equipment  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and make distributions from subsidiaries 
a decline in our operating results or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in us being unable to comply with certain covenants contained in the abl facility  which become operative only when our average excess availability as defined in the abl facility is less than million 
these financial covenants include a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio of to and a minimum consolidated net worth of million under the terms of the abl facility currently approximately million as adjusted for accounting changes 
the indentures governing certain of our senior notes also contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  subordinate indebtedness to other indebtedness unless such subordinated indebtedness is also subordinated to the notes  pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  sell assets and issue capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  incur liens  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
if we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders  our debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by the lenders and  in the case of an event of default under our abl facility  it could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the loans under the abl facility 
if the indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us 
if our debt is in default for any reason  our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to our shareholders and holders of our senior notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
we are subject to being adversely affected by the potential inability to renew or obtain surety bonds 
federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining  to pay federal and state workers compensation and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
we are also subject to increases in the amount of surety bonds required by federal and state laws as these laws change or the interpretation of these laws changes 
our failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse impact on us  possibly by prohibiting us from developing properties that we desire to develop 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including the following i lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  ii restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our senior notes or revolving credit facilities  iii our inability to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the post mining reclamation bonds  and iv the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew or issue new bonds 
we depend on our ability to continue acquiring and developing economically recoverable coal reserves 
a key component of our future success is our ability to continue acquiring coal reserves for development that have the geological characteristics that allow them to be economically mined 
replacement reserves may not be available or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristics of the depleting mines 
an inability to continue acquiring economically recoverable coal reserves could have a material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we face numerous uncertainties in estimating economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by us 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties may vary substantially 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
mining in central appalachia is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the united states  which could affect our mining operations and cost structures in these areas 
the geological characteristics of central appalachian coal reserves  such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness  make them complex and costly to mine 
as mines become depleted  replacement reserves may not be available when required or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines 
in addition  as compared to mines in other regions  permitting  licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements are more costly and time consuming to satisfy 
these factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of  and our customers ability to use coal produced by  our mines in central appalachia 
defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to mine our properties or result in significant unanticipated costs 
a significant portion of our mining operations occurs on properties that we lease 
title defects or the loss of leases could adversely affect our ability to mine the reserves covered by those leases 
our current practice is to obtain a title review from a licensed attorney prior to leasing property 
we generally have not obtained title insurance in connection with acquisitions of coal reserves 
in some cases  the seller or lessor warrants property title 
separate title confirmation sometimes is not required when leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously 
our right to mine some of our reserves may be adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist 
in order to obtain leases to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects exist  we may have to incur unanticipated costs 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully negotiate new leases for properties containing additional reserves  or maintain our leasehold interests in properties where we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  our profitability could be impaired 
an increase in the demand for coal could attract new investors to the coal industry  which could spur the development of new mines  and result in added production capacity throughout the industry 
higher price levels of coal could also encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any resulting increases in capacity could reduce coal prices and reduce our margins 
an inability of brokerage sources or contract miners to fulfill the delivery terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability 
we sometimes obtain coal from brokerage sources and contract miners to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements 
some of our brokerage sources and contract miners may experience adverse geologic mining  escalated operating costs and or financial difficulties that make their delivery of coal to us at the contracted price difficult or uncertain 
our profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships such as these may be affected based upon the reliability of the supply or the ability to substitute  when economical  third party coal sources  with internal production or coal purchased in the market and other factors 
decreased availability or increased costs of key equipment  supplies or commodities such as diesel fuel  steel  explosives  magnetite and tires could decrease our profitability 
our operations are dependant on reliable supplies of mining equipment  replacement parts  explosives  diesel fuel  tires  magnetite and steel related products including roof bolts 
if the cost of any mining equipment or key supplies increases significantly  or if they should become unavailable due to higher industry wide demand or less production by suppliers  there could be an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the supplier base providing mining materials and equipment has been relatively consistent in recent years  although there continues to be consolidation 
this consolidation has resulted in a situation where purchases of explosives and certain underground mining equipment are concentrated with single suppliers 
in recent years  mining industry demand growth has exceeded supply growth for certain surface and underground mining equipment and heavy equipment tires 
as a result  lead times for certain items have generally increased 
transportation disruptions could impair our ability to sell coal 
we are dependent on our transportation providers to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts  fuel shortages or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers 
our ability to ship coal could be negatively impacted by a reduction in available and timely rail service 
lack of sufficient resources to meet a rapid increase in demand  a greater demand for transportation to export terminals and rail line congestion all could contribute to a disruption and slowdown in rail service 
we continue to experience rail service delays and disruptions in service which are negatively impacting our ability to deliver coal to customers and which may adversely affect our results of operations 
severe weather may affect our ability to mine and deliver coal 
severe weather  including flooding and excessive ice or snowfall  when it occurs  can adversely affect our ability to produce  load and transport coal  which may negatively impact our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
federal  state and local laws and government regulations applicable to operations increase costs and may make our coal less competitive than other coal producers 
we incur substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations 
the costs of compliance with applicable regulations and liabilities assessed for compliance failure could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect our mining operations  cost structure or our customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require us  as well as our customers  to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa has undertaken broad initiatives to increase compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to our customers to decrease their emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source or by installing scrubbers or other expensive emissions reduction equipment at their coal fired plants 
concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion  including perceived impacts on global climate change  are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions  and interest in further regulation  which could significantly affect demand for our products 
the clean air act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the largest end users of our coal 
such regulation may require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal fired power plants 
as a result  the generators may switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions or install more effective pollution control equipment  possibly reducing future demand for coal and the construction of coal fired power plants 
the majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use 
global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention 
widely publicized scientific reports  such as the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change released in  have also engendered widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially fossil fuel combustion  on global climate change 
a considerable and increasing amount of attention in the united states is being paid to global climate change and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  particularly from coal combustion by power plants 
according to the eia report  emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  coal combustion accounts for of man made greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
legislation was introduced in congress in the past several years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the united states and  although no bills to reduce such emissions have yet to pass both houses of congress  bills to reduce such emissions remain pending and others are likely to be introduced 
president obama campaigned in favor of a cap and trade program to require mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions and since his election has continued to express support for such legislation  contrary to the previous administration 
the united states supreme court s decision in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency ruled that epa improperly declined to address carbon dioxide impacts on climate change in a rulemaking related to new motor vehicles 
the reasoning of the court decision could affect other federal regulatory programs  including those that directly relate to coal use 
in july  epa published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr seeking comments regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  and in february the newly appointed administrator of epa granted a petition by environmental advocacy groups to reconsider an interpretive memorandum by her predecessor in december that concluded the clean air act s prevention of significant deterioration program does not extend to carbon dioxide emissions  a decision that could lead to carbon dioxide emissions from coal fired power plants being a consideration in permitting decisions 
in addition  a growing number of states in the united states are taking steps to require greenhouse gas emissions reductions from coal fired power plants 
enactment of laws and promulgation of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the united states or some of its states  or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions  could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources 
in december  countries attended the copenhagen climate change summit to discuss actions to be taken to combat global climate change 
leaders from more than two dozen countries representing over percent of the world s so emissions negotiated the copenhagen accord  which puts a non binding expectation on all of the major emitting countries to officially record their commitments to reduce so emissions by january  the united states participated in the conference and stated a goal to reduce emissions in the range of percent below levels by  percent below levels by  and percent below levels by  which is substantially in line with the energy and climate legislation passed by the united states house of representatives in the ultimate outcome of the copenhagen accord and any treaty or other arrangement ultimately adopted by the united states or other countries  may have a material adverse impact on the global supply and demand for coal 
this is particularly true if cost effective technology for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide is not sufficiently developed 
technologies that may significantly reduce emissions into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases from coal combustion  such as carbon capture and sequestration which captures carbon dioxide at major sources such as power plants and subsequently stores it in nonatmospheric reservoirs such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs  unmineable coal seams  deep saline formations  or the deep ocean have attracted and continue to attract the attention of policy makers  industry participants  and the public 
for example  in july  epa proposed rules that would establish  for the first time  requirements specifically for wells used to inject carbon dioxide into geologic formations 
no regulations have been promulgated yet  but the issue of carbon sequestration results in considerable uncertainty  not only regarding rules that may become applicable to carbon dioxide injection wells but also concerning liability for potential impacts of injection  such as groundwater contamination or seismic activity 
in addition  technical  environmental  economic  or other factors may delay  limit  or preclude large scale commercial deployment of such technologies  which could ultimately provide little or no significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from coal combustion 
further developments in connection with legislation  regulations or other limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from coal combustion  both in the united states and in other countries where we sell coal  could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
our operations may adversely impact the environment which could result in material liabilities to us 
the processes required to mine coal may cause certain impacts or generate certain materials that might adversely affect the environment from time to time 
the mining processes we use could cause us to become subject to claims for toxic torts  natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  groundwater  and other media 
such claims may arise  for example  out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate  as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated  or may acquire 
our liability for such claims may be joint and several  so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages  or even for the entire share 
certain coal that we mine needs to be cleaned at preparation plants  which generally require coal refuse areas and or slurry impoundments 
such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation and monitoring 
slurry impoundments have been known to fail  releasing large volumes of coal slurry into nearby surface waters and property  resulting in damage to the environment and natural resources  as well as injuries to wildlife 
we maintain coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes 
if one of our impoundments were to fail  we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental impact and associated liability  as well as for fines and penalties 
drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals  a condition referred to as acid mine drainage amd 
although we do not currently face material costs associated with amd  it is possible that we could incur significant costs in the future 
these and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment  as well as exposures to certain substances or wastes associated with our operations  could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect us and could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the mine safety and health administration msha or other federal or state regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers demands 
msha or other federal or state regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed 
our customers may challenge our issuance of force majeure notices in connection with such closures 
if these challenges are successful  we may have to purchase coal from third party sources to satisfy those challenges  negotiate settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  terminate customers contracts or face claims initiated by our customers against us 
the resolution of these challenges could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process  can result in restrictions on our operations  and is subject to litigation that may delay or prevent us from obtaining necessary permits 
our operations are principally regulated under surface mining permits issued pursuant to the surface mining control and reclamation act the smcra and state counterpart laws 
such permits are issued for terms of five years with the right of successive renewal 
additionally  the clean water act requires permits for operations that discharge into waters of the united states 
valley fills and refuse impoundments are authorized under permits issued by the united states army corps of engineers 
such permitting under the clean water act has been a frequent subject of litigation by environmental advocacy groups that has resulted in periodic declines in such permits issued by the united states army corps of engineers 
additionally  certain surface mines and preparation plants have permits issued pursuant to the clean air act and state counterpart laws allowing and controlling the discharge of air pollutants 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in  or in some instances preclude  the commencement or continuation of development or production operations 
adverse outcomes in lawsuits challenging permits or failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the suspension  denial or revocation of required permits  which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract qualified personnel could affect our ability to operate the company effectively 
the successful management of our business is dependent on a number of key personnel 
our future success will be affected by our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there are no assurances that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
failure to retain or attract key personnel could have an adverse affect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
shortages of skilled labor in the central appalachian coal industry may pose a risk in achieving high levels of productivity at competitive costs 
coal mining continues to be a labor intensive industry 
from time to time  we have encountered a shortage of experienced mine workers when the demand and prices for all specifications of coal we mine increased appreciably 
during those periods  the hiring of these less experienced workers negatively impacted our productivity and cash costs 
a lack of skilled miners could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and cost and our ability to meet current production requirements to fulfill existing sales commitments or to expand production to meet the increased demand for coal 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs 
at december   approximately of our total workforce was represented by the united mine workers of america the umwa 
our unionized workforce is spread out amongst five of our coal preparation plants 
in  these preparation plants handled approximately of our coal production 
we are currently in the process of negotiating successor collective bargaining agreements for ones that have expired 
in connection with these negotiations and with respect to our unionized operations generally  there may be an increased risk of strikes and other labor disputes  as well as higher labor costs 
if some or all of our current open shop operations were to become unionized  we could be subject to additional risk of work stoppages  other labor disputes and higher labor costs  which could adversely affect the stability of production and reduce net income 
legislation has been proposed to the united states congress to enact a law allowing for workers to choose union representation solely by signing election cards card check  which would eliminate the use of secret ballots to elect union representation 
while the impact is uncertain  if card check legislation is enacted into law  it will be administratively easier for the umwa to unionize coal mines and may lead to more coal mines becoming unionized 
inflationary pressures on supplies and labor may adversely affect our profit margins 
although inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years  over the course of the last two to three years  we have been significantly impacted by price inflation in many of the components of our cost of produced coal revenue  such as fuel  steel and labor 
if the prices for which we sell our coal do not increase in step with rising costs or if these costs do not decline sufficiently  our profit margins would be reduced and our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition would be adversely affected 
we are subject to various legal proceedings  which may have a material effect on our business 
we are parties to a number of legal proceedings incident to normal business activities 
some of the allegations brought against us are with merit  while others are not 
there is always the potential that an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering expertise related to these requirements 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by management and engineers 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
our future expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions are incorrect 
we are subject to long term liabilities under a variety of benefit plans and other arrangements with current and former employees 
these obligations have been estimated based on actuarial assumptions  including actuarial estimates  assumed discount rates  estimates of life expectancy  expected returns on pension plan assets and changes in healthcare costs 
if our assumptions relating to these benefits change in the future or are incorrect  we may be required to record additional expenses  which would reduce our profitability 
in addition  future regulatory and accounting changes relating to these benefits could result in increased obligations or additional costs  which could also have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see also notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our pension plans are currently underfunded and we may have to make significant cash payments to the plans  reducing the cash available for our business 
we sponsor a qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plan  which covers substantially all administrative and non union employees 
we currently expect to make voluntary contributions in of approximately million 
if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations  or if other actuarial assumptions are modified  our contributions could be higher than we expect 
the value of the assets held in our pension plans has been adversely affected by the recent disruptions in the financial markets  and the applicable discount rates applied in determining our pension liabilities have also been negatively affected by the crisis in the financial markets 
as a result  as of december   our annual measurement date  our pension plan was underfunded by million based on the actuarial assumptions used in the application of gaap 
our pension plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
under erisa  the pension benefit guaranty corporation  or pbgc  has the authority to terminate an underfunded pension plan under limited circumstances 
in the event our pension plan is terminated for any reason while the plan is underfunded  we will incur a liability to the pbgc that may be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws  the agreements governing our indebtedness and delaware law may discourage a takeover attempt even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could impose impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire us even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock  without any vote or action by our stockholders 
thus  our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of common stock 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder  meaning  generally  that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than of common stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met  such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock 
if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the convertible senior notes due notes occurs  holders of the notes will have the right  at their option  either to convert their notes or require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes  and holders of the convertible senior notes due notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes 
in the event of a make whole fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes  we also may be required to increase the conversion rate applicable to any notes surrendered for conversion 
in addition  the indentures for the convertible notes prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless  among other things  the surviving entity is a us entity that assumes our obligations under the convertible notes 
certain of our debt instruments impose similar restrictions on us  including with respect to mergers or consolidations with other companies and the sale of substantially all of our assets 
these provisions could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to you 
we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we undertake  as acquisitions entail a number of inherent risks 
from time to time we expand our business and reserve position through acquisitions of businesses and assets  mergers  joint ventures or other transactions 
such transactions involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental liabilities of  acquisition or other transaction candidates  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  the risk of obtaining mining permits for acquired coal assets  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale 
any one or more of these and other factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets or could result in unexpected liabilities associated with these acquisitions 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad 
we rely on customers in other countries for a portion of our sales  with shipments to countries in north america  south america  europe  asia and africa 
we compete in these international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in united states dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in united states dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets 
terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is affected by general economic conditions  fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  and market liquidity  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or military or trade disruptions affecting customers may materially adversely affect operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to customers  decreased sales of coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from customers 
strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the united states 
in addition  such disruption may lead to significant increases in energy prices that could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any  or a combination  of these occurrences could have a material impact on cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks  some for which we maintain third party insurance and some for which we self insure 
our operations are subject to certain events and conditions that could disrupt operations  including fires and explosions  accidental mine water discharges  coal slurry releases and impoundment failures  natural disasters  equipment failures  maintenance problems and flooding 
we maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where insurance coverage applies  there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by insurance policies and insurers may contest their obligations to make payments 
failures by insurers to make payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we self insure our highwall miners and underground equipment  including our longwalls 
we do not currently carry business interruption insurance

risk factors and are incorporated herein 
executive overview we operate coal mines and processing facilities in central appalachia  which generate revenues and cash flow through the mining  processing and selling of steam and metallurgical grade coal  primarily of low sulfur content 
we also generate income and cash flow through other coal related businesses 
other revenue is obtained from royalties  rentals  gas well revenues  gains on the sale of non strategic assets and miscellaneous income 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income for of million  or per diluted share 
net income in included pre tax gains totaling million for the sale and exchange of coal reserve interests and other assets with third parties and a net gain of million on certain coal contracts that do not qualify for the normal purchase normal sale npns exception 
net income in included pre tax charges of million related to the litigation with wheeling pittsburgh steel corporation wheeling pittsburgh  pre tax gains totaling million related to asset and reserve exchanges with third parties and a million non cash pre tax charge to recognize the net unrealized losses on certain coal contracts that do not qualify for the npns exception 
during  we completed several coal reserve trades and acquisitions that increased our total reserve base 
these transactions  in addition to adjustments made in conjunction with normal annual review and re evaluation of reserves  and offset by million tons of coal produced  resulted in a net increase of million tons of coal reserves during the year 
following this increase  we estimate that we had billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves at december on august   a fire destroyed the bandmill preparation plant at our logan county resource group  located near logan  west virginia 
this incident impacted the operations at logan county and  to a lesser extent  our operations as a whole during the second half of efforts to replace production at our other locations to help mitigate the effects of the fire  including meeting customer commitments  are ongoing 
we maintain property insurance which is expected to cover property losses incurred from the fire 
we received million in insurance proceeds during a replacement preparation plant is currently under construction  which is expected to be operational by the fall of produced tons sold were million in  compared to million in we produced million and million tons in and  respectively 
the lower coal production in was primarily the result of the idling of higher cost mines and the reduction of hours worked  mainly overtime and weekend shifts  in response to lower demand 
exports decreased from million tons in to million tons in increasing coal stockpiles due to utilities shifting to gas fired generation and weak demand for electric power generation and steel production in both domestic and international markets has created challenges among our customer base to accept shipments of coal according to contracted schedules 
we are working with our customers to modify shipment schedules and amend contract terms where necessary or appropriate  which may affect our revenues and margins in future periods 
during  produced coal revenue decreased by compared to  reflecting lower shipments in our average produced coal revenue per ton sold in increased to compared to in our average produced coal revenue per ton in for metallurgical tons sold decreased by to from in the average per ton sales price for utility and industrial coal was higher in compared to  attributable to prices contracted during prior periods when demand and pricing were elevated for these grades of coal in the united states 
our average cash cost per ton sold was in  compared to in the increased cost level is primarily due to higher fixed cost absorption on lower volume shipped  higher labor costs  and higher equipment rental costs 
in response to the current difficult market conditions  we have taken certain actions to reduce overall costs including the idling of several higher cost mines  limitation of overtime  selective general and administrative cost reductions  renegotiation of supply contracts and the implementation of significant wage and benefit reductions beginning on may  while certain general business conditions appear to be improving  the recent recession  credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
we may face significant future challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not continue to improve 
worldwide demand for coal has been adversely impacted by the recent global recession 
demand for metallurgical coal has been disproportionately affected as most steel producers responded to the recent recession by significantly reducing production levels 
this  in turn  has led to lower sales volumes and a number requests from our customers for the deferral of contracted shipments 
these conditions have negatively impacted our revenues 
additionally  the volatility and disruption of financial markets has and could continue to affect the creditworthiness of our customers and or limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations 
this could result in a further decrease in sales volume that could have a further negative impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the steel industry and the global metallurgical coal markets have shown recent signs of improvement 
several steel producers have announced plans to restart idled blast furnaces and production capacity utilization rates have begun to increase 
the timing of any improvement is uncertain but if these trends continue  it could have a positive impact on metallurgical coal demand and improve our opportunities to sell our metallurgical coal

see also concentration of credit risk and major customers in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we frequently evaluate potential acquisitions 
in the past  we have funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations 
as a result of the cash needs we have described above and possible acquisition opportunities  in the future we may consider a variety of financing sources  including debt or equity financing 
currently  other than our abl  we have no commitments for any additional financing 
we cannot be certain that we can obtain additional financing on terms that we find acceptable  if at all  through the issuance of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt 
additional equity financing may dilute our stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may  among other things  restrict our ability to repurchase common stock  declare and pay dividends and raise future capital 
if we are unable to obtain additional needed financing  it may prohibit us from making acquisitions  capital expenditures and or investments  which could materially and adversely affect our prospects for long term growth 
common stock offering program on february   pursuant to rule b  we filed a prospectus supplement with the securities and exchange commission sec allowing us to sell up to million shares of common stock from time to time in our discretion 
the proceeds from any shares of common stock sold will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include funding for acquisitions or investments in business  products  technologies  and repurchases and repayment of our indebtedness 
as of january   no shares of common stock had been sold pursuant to this program 
share repurchases the board of directors has authorized a total of million excluding commissions to repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program 
through december    shares have been repurchased at an average price of per share and classified as treasury stock 
all of the  shares held as treasury stock were re issued as part of the  shares of common stock which were offered and sold in an underwritten public offering in august no additional share repurchases have been made since that time 
as of december   we had million available under the current authorization 
we may repurchase shares of common stock from time to time in compliance with the sec s regulations and other legal requirements  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
the share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be terminated at any time 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
other obligations  such as certain purchase commitments  operating lease agreements  and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
the following table is a summary of our significant obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
the table does not include current liabilities accrued within the consolidated financial statements  such as accounts payable and payroll and employee benefits 
payments due by period in thousands total within year years years beyond years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations coal lease obligations purchased coal obligations other purchase obligations total obligations long term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of our fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding as of december  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
capital lease obligations include the amount of imputed interest over the terms of the leases 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
coal lease obligations include minimum royalties paid on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of years 
purchased coal obligations represent commitments to purchase coal from external production sources under firm contracts as of december  other purchase obligations primarily include capital expenditure commitments for surface mining and other equipment as well as purchases of materials and supplies 
we have purchase agreements with vendors for most types of operating expenses 
however  our open purchase orders which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received under these purchase agreements  combined with any other open purchase orders  are not material and are excluded from this table 
other purchase obligations also include contractual commitments under transportation contracts 
since the actual tons to be shipped under these contracts are not set and will vary  the amount included in the table reflects the minimum payment obligations required by the contracts 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension and other postretirement benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  the estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in critical accounting estimates and assumptions of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  which are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
from time to time we use bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for workers compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding of which million was collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts pledged to issuing banks and million was issued under our asset based lending arrangement 
no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit as of december  we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  an appeal bond of million of cash as collateral in the harman litigation see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
outstanding surety bonds of million are secured with letters of credit 
generally  the availability and market terms of surety bonds continue to be challenging 
if we are unable to meet certain financial tests applicable to some of our surety bonds  or to the extent that surety bonds otherwise become unavailable  we would need to replace the surety bonds or seek to secure them with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
certain trends and uncertainties our inability to satisfy contractual obligations may adversely affect profitability 
from time to time  we have disputes with customers over the provisions of sales agreements relating to  among other things  coal pricing  quality  quantity  delays and force majeure declarations 
our inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in the purchase of coal from third party sources to satisfy those obligations  the negotiation of settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  and customers terminating contracts  declining to do future business with us  or initiating claims against us 
a few of our customers have notified us of losses they have allegedly incurred due to alleged shortfalls in contracted coal shipments 
we believe that factors beyond our control or responsibility account for most or all of the shortfalls 
however  we may not be able to resolve all of these disputes  or other disputes with customers over sales agreements  in a satisfactory manner  which could result in the payment of substantial damages or otherwise harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business  financial condition and liquidity in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the continuing credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial markets  which has begun to ease in recent months  has had and may continue to have an impact on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
the current difficult economic market environment has caused contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace 
in addition to the impact that the global financial crisis has already had on us  we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not continue to improve or worsen 
in addition  our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access these markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and could potentially reduce our sources of liquidity 
moreover  volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
capital and credit market volatility may affect our costs of borrowing 
while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions  their continued viability is not certain 
difficulties at one or more such financial institutions could lead them not to honor their contractual credit commitments under our abl facility or to renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit 
recently  the capital and credit markets have been highly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies 
if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited  we may incur increased costs associated with borrowings 
while we believe that recent governmental and regulatory actions should reduce the risk of a further deterioration or systemic contraction of capital and credit markets  there can be no certainty that our liquidity will not be negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets 
we may be adversely affected by a decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers 
in an effort to mitigate credit related risks in all customer classifications  we maintain a credit policy  which requires scheduled reviews of customer creditworthiness and continuous monitoring of customer news events that might have an impact on their financial condition 
negative credit performance or other events may trigger the application of tighter terms of sale  requirements for collateral or guaranties or  ultimately  a suspension of credit privileges 
the creditworthiness of customers can limit who we can do business with and at what price 
for the year ended december   approximately of coal sales volume was pursuant to long term contracts 
we anticipate that in  the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of our sales for for  approximately of our projected sales tons are contracted to be sold to our largest customers 
many of our customers  including many of our large customers  experienced lower demand and weaker financial performance due to the recent economic downturn 
if one or more of our larger customers fails to make payment for our sales to them  there could be an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we have contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies who resell the coal to the ultimate users 
we are subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies 
in addition  as one of the largest suppliers of metallurgical coal to the united states steel industry and a significant exporter to foreign users  we are subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition or production volume of both united states and foreign steel producers 
some of our customers may be unwilling to take all of their contracted tonnage or may request a price lower than their contracted price 
many of our customers experienced lower demand for their products and services due to the recent economic downturn and have been switching of electricity generation from coal burning plants to natural gas plants 
the lower demand for our customers products resulted and may continue to result in lower demand for the coal used in their business 
some of our customers have requested and others may request deferrals of shipments  reduction of contracted sales tonnages and or reduction of the contracted sales price 
if we believe it is in our best interests to agree to any reduction in contracted price and or tons from our customers  there could be an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process  can result in restrictions on our operations  and is subject to litigation that may delay or prevent us from obtaining necessary permits 
our operations are principally regulated under surface mining permits issued pursuant to the surface mining control and reclamation act and state counterpart laws 
such permits are issued for terms of five years with the right of successive renewal 
separately  the clean water act requires permits for operations that discharge into waters of the united states 
valley fills and refuse impoundments are authorized under permits issued by the us army corps of engineers the corps 
the environmental protection agency the epa has the authority  which it has rarely exercised until recently  to object to permits issued by the corps 
while the corps is authorized to issue permits even when the epa has objections  the epa does have the ability to override the corps decision and veto the permits 
in september  the epa announced it had identified pending permit applications for appalachian surface coal mining  under a coordination process with the corps and the united states department of the interior entered into in june  that epa believes warrant further review because of its continuing concerns about water quality and or regulatory compliance issues 
these include five of our permit applications 
while the epa has stated that its identification of these permits does not constitute a determination that the mining involved cannot be permitted under the clean water act and does not constitute a final recommendation from the epa to the corps on these projects  it is unclear how long the further review will take for our five permits or what the final outcome will be 
it is also unclear what impact this process may have on our future applications for surface coal mining permits 
permitting under the clean water act has been a frequent subject of litigation by environmental advocacy groups that has resulted in periodic delays in such permits issued by the corps 
additionally  certain operations particularly preparation plants have permits issued pursuant to the clean air act and state counterpart laws allowing and controlling the discharge of air pollutants 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in  or in some instances preclude  the commencement or continuation of development or production operations 
adverse outcomes in lawsuits challenging permits or failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the suspension  denial or revocation of required permits  which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see also note  contingencies surface mining fills to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion  including perceived impacts on global climate change  are resulting in increased regulation of coal combustion in many jurisdictions  and interest in further regulation  which could significantly affect demand for our products 
the clean air act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the largest end users of our coal 
such regulation may require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal fired power plants 
as a result  the generators may switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions or install more effective pollution control equipment  possibly reducing future demand for coal and the construction of coal fired power plants 
the majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser s plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use 
global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention 
widely publicized scientific reports  such as the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change released in  have also engendered widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially fossil fuel combustion  on global climate change 
a considerable and increasing amount of attention in the united states is being paid to global climate change and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  particularly from coal combustion by power plants 
according to the eia report  emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  coal combustion accounts for of man made greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
in april  the epa released a proposed rule making an endangerment finding with respect to six greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  due to effects on public health and welfare  if finalized  such a finding would trigger the process under the clean air act for developing air quality standards for these greenhouse gases and establishing emission standards for sources 
in june of  the us house of representatives passed the so called waxman markey bill  which provides for substantial reductions in greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  through a cap and trade system 
cap and trade legislation was also introduced in the us senate in the fall of further developments in connection with legislation  regulations or other limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from coal combustion  both in the united states and in other countries where we sell coal  could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in determining certain liabilities described below could introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension plans the estimated cost and benefits of non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with management s review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the applicable liabilities could be effectively settled as of the measurement date 
in estimating the discount rate  forecasted cash flows were discounted using each year s associated spot interest rate on high quality fixed income investments 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine defined benefit pension liability was and  respectively 
the impact of lowering the discount rate for would have increased the net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon our long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
during  we made a temporary shift in our pension investments targeted asset allocation in response to the volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets 
we invested a large percentage of plan assets in debt securities with a fixed duration with the intent to return to the long term targeted asset allocation upon maturity of the fixed duration investments 
as we plan to return to our targeted asset allocation  we believe the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of continues to be appropriate 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was for both of the years ended december  and a decrease in the expected long term rate of return assumption would have increased the net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our pension plans 
coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
an annual evaluation is prepared by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by management  use various assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs trend  cost of living trend  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
we record expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine the black lung liability was and  respectively 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a medical cost trend and cost of living trend sensitivity analysis 
workers compensation our operations have workers compensation coverage through a combination of either self insurance  participation in a state run program  or commercial insurance 
we accrue for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability we utilize the services of third party administrators who derive claim reserves from historical experience 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with management with regards to actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured liabilities 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine the self insured workers compensation liability obligation was and  respectively 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the workers compensation self insured liability and related expense 
actual experience in settling these liabilities could differ from these estimates  which could increase our costs 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on workers compensation 
other postretirement benefits our sponsored health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
we pay costs as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of the retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by management  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita claims costs 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit liability was and  respectively 
the impact of lowering the discount rate for would have increased the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately million 
at december   assumptions of our health care plans cost trend were projected at annual rates of for pre medicare claims  for medicare eligible claims and for medicare supplemental plans  all ranging down to by and remaining level thereafter 
the impact of increasing the health care cost trend rate by would have increased the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately million 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a sensitivity analysis on the health care trend rate assumption 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and engineering estimates related to these requirements 
gaap requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit  as necessary 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate applied is based on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow  adjusted for our credit standing 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
contingencies we are parties to a number of legal proceedings  incident to our normal business activities 
these matters include contract disputes  personal injury  property damage and employment matters 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  based on our current estimates  we do not believe that the estimated liability arising from these matters individually or in the aggregate should have a material impact upon our consolidated cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
however  it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liabilities in the future with respect to these lawsuits and claims may be material to our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 
income taxes gaap requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
gaap also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including tax attribute carrybacks  the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
we are required to establish reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with tax positions taken relative to temporary and permanent tax differences and tax credits  plus penalties and interest  if any  on the accrued uncertain tax positions 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves 
management believes that we have adequately provided for any income taxes that may ultimately be paid with respect to all open tax years 
coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our internal engineers  geologists and financial associates 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances would affect both the consolidated statements of income  in the form of revenue and expenditures  as well as the consolidated balance sheets  in the form of valuation of coal reserves  depletion rates and potential impairment 
derivative instruments upon entering into each coal sales and coal purchase contract  we evaluate each of our contracts to determine if they qualify for the npns exception prescribed by current accounting guidance 
the majority of our contracts qualify for the npns exception and therefore are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
for those contracts that do not qualify for the npns exception at inception or at some point during the duration of the contract  the contracts are required to be accounted for as derivative instruments and must be recognized as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
to establish fair values for these contracts  we use bid ask price quotations obtained from independent third party brokers 
we also consider the risk of nonperformance of or nonpayment by the counterparties when determining the fair values for these contracts by evaluating the credit quality and financial condition of each counterparty 
if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced  we could experience difficulty in determining the fair value of our derivative instruments 
the net change in the fair value of our contracts that did not qualify for the npns exception at december  and  was recognized as an unrealized gain loss in the consolidated statements of income under the caption gain loss on derivative instruments 
in evaluating our contracts for the npns exception at inception  we consider many factors  including management s intent and ability to physically deliver or take physical delivery of the coal  as well as the counterparty s intent and ability to physically accept or deliver coal 
these factors may change over the duration of a contract  due to  for example  the counterparty s inability to physically accept or deliver coal or to our decision to net settle a portion or all of a forward contract by entering into an offsetting contract 
these facts and circumstances may cause a contract to no longer qualify for the npns exception 
if a contract originally evaluated as qualifying for the npns exception no longer qualifies  it is prospectively accounted for as a derivative instrument and recognized as an asset or liability and measured at fair value 
to the extent there is an increase in the number of contracts that do not qualify for the npns exception  it could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk our net interest expense is currently not sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
at december   all of the outstanding  million of our debt was under fixed rate instruments 
however  if it should become necessary to borrow under our abl facility  those borrowings would be made at a variable rate 
interest income is sensitive to changes in short term interest rates 
in  we primarily managed market price risk for coal through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of one year or more in duration  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we estimate that the percentage of tons sold pursuant to these long term contracts was for our fiscal year ended december  we anticipate that in  the percentage of our tons sold pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of our sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of our sales that are subject to these long term agreements  we have less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts may allow the customer to elect volume flexibility based on requirements  our ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or our exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons 
from time to time we may also purchase coal directly from third parties to supplement our produced and processed coal in order to provide coal to meet customer requirements under sales contracts 
certain of our purchase and sale contracts do not qualify for the npns exception and are accordingly measured at fair value in current period earnings 
the use of purchase and sales contracts which do not qualify for the npns exception could materially affect our results of operations as a result of the requirement to mark them to market at the end of each reporting period 
these transactions give rise to commodity price risk  which represents the potential gain or loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the price of coal 
outstanding purchase and sales contracts at december   that do not qualify for the npns exception are summarized as follows price range tons outstanding delivery period purchase contracts sales contracts as of december   a hypothetical increase of in the forward market price would result in an additional fair value loss recorded for these derivative instruments of million 
a hypothetical decrease of in the forward market price would result in a reduction in the fair value loss recorded for these derivative instruments of million
