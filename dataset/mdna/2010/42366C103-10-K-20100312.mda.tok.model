statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before item b above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company based in philadelphia  pennsylvania and engaged in the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based chronic disorders 
our flagship products include alferon n injection and the experimental therapeutics ampligen 
alferon n injection is approved for a category of std infection  and ampligen represents an experimental rna nucleic acids being developed for globally important viral diseases and disorders of the immune system 
hemispherx platform technology includes large and small agent components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases 
we have patents comprising our core intellectual property estate  a product alferon n injection and cgmp certified manufacturing facilities for our novel pharmaceutical products 
we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting research and development programs 
results of operations year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was higher when compared to the same period in this  increase in loss was primarily due to increased research and development costs in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in sales of alferon n injection for of approximately  compared to no sales recorded in decreased interest and other income in of approximately  or as compared to the same period in increased non cash financing costs of  in in the form of common stock commitment warrants incurred as a result of the february implementation of the standby financing agreement 
no agreement of this type was in effect during decreased production cost of goods sold in of approximately  or and decreased general and administrative expenses of approximately  or as compared to the same period in net loss per share for the year ended was versus for the same period in revenues there were no revenues related to the sale of alferon n injection for the twelve month period ended while there were approximately  of sales for the same period of revenues from our ampligen cost recovery treatment program for the year ended december  were approximately  compared to revenues of  for the same period in  an increase of  or for approximately the same number of patients participating in the program 
commercial sales of alferon n injection were halted in march as the expiration date of our finished goods inventory expired in march as a result  we have no alferon n injection product to commercially sell in and all revenue in has been generated from ampligen cost recovery clinical treatment programs 
in and production of alferon n injection had been put on hold due to the resources needed to prepare our new brunswick facility for the fda preapproval inspection with respect to our ampligen nda 
we now have the financial resources to commence manufacturing upgrades that will be undertaken throughout as a result  alferon n injection could be available for commercial sales in mid to late production cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this represents a decrease of  or as compared to the same period in these expenses primarily represent the costs to maintain alferon n injection and ampligen inventories including storage  stability testing  transport and reporting costs including ampligen nda work undertaken in additionally  there was a reduction in cost of goods sold for due to the lack of alferon n injection sales 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  for the same period a year ago reflecting an increase of  or 
s research and development costs include the write off of approximately  for patents that management either has not renewed the rights to or deemed no longer of value and or material to future operations 
additionally  research and development costs increased approximately  due to research and clinical employees participating in the employee wage or hour reduction program see liquidity and capital resources below for details  approximately  to evaluate and begin to ready the new brunswick plant for production and a net increase of  in comparing to expenses related to the efforts of employees in responding to the fda and issued bonus awards 
during and  we spent considerable time and effort preparing for the preapproval inspection by the fda of manufacturing of ampligen product and its raw materials  polynucleotides poly i and poly cu 
a satisfactory recommendation from the fda office of compliance based upon an acceptable preapproval inspection is required prior to approval of the product 
the preapproval inspection determines compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp as well as a product specific evaluation concerning the manufacturing process of product 
the inspection includes many aspects of the cgmp requirements  such as manufacturing process validation  equipment qualification  analytical method validation  facility cleaning  quality systems  documentation system and part compliance 
in its november  crl  the fda described specific additional recommendations related to the ampligen nda 
the fda reviewers determined that they could not approve the application in its present form and provided specific recommendations to address the outstanding issues 
on september   we executed an agreement with lovelace respiratory research institute lovelace in albuquerque  new mexico to perform certain animal toxicity studies in support of our ampligen nda 
these studies were requested by the fda and have been done in collaboration with the resources of the new brunswick facility 
on january   we submitted reports of new preclinical data regarding ampligen for potential treatment of cfs to the fda which we believe to be sufficient to address certain preclinical issues referenced in the crl 
the new preclinical data showed no evidence of antibodies against ampligen in primates and no evidence of an increase in certain undesirable cytokines specific modulators of the immune system at clinically used doses of ampligen for cfs 
although most other experimental immunomodulators have been associated with one or more features of aberrant immune activity  including toll like receptor activators of which ampligen is one  this was specifically not seen with ampligen in primates 
we are engaged in ongoing  experimental studies assessing the efficacy of ampligen  alferon n injection and alferon ldo against influenza viruses 
as a result  we have been focusing our resources on the studies being undertaken in japan and united states as well as the design of new alferon ldo studies for both prevention and treatment of seasonal or pandemic influenza 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or 
this decrease relates primarily to the effect of the cash conservation and cost reduction program implemented in january accordingly  areas of expenses were reduced including legal fees of approximately  stock compensation of approximately  accounting and related fees of approximately  a reduction in personnel costs of approximately  along with reduced expenses of approximately  related to discontinuation of sales of alferon 
these cost savings were somewhat offset by an increase of approximately  of incremental non cash labor expenses resulting from g a employees participating in the employee wage or hour reduction program along with an increase of approximately  in financial consulting  security filings and transfer fees  approximately  in costs related to the second round of stockholder voting and approximately  in professional advisor fees 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased approximately  or during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in due to reduction of cash available to invest during the first five months of at lower interest rates 
while we received an infusion of cash from the two rodman deals in may  along with the receipt of additional cash from fusion capital in the third quarter of  historically low interest rates existed for conservative investments throughout interest expense and financing costs we had no interest expense for or in february  we entered into a standby financing agreement that produced finance costs of  in common stock commitment warrants for the twelve months ended december  for which no agreement of this type existed during the prior period in for detailed information on this agreement  please see standby financing agreement below 
year ended december  versus december  net loss our net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  was lower when compared to the same period in this  reduction in loss was primarily due to decreased research and development expenses in of approximately  as compared to the same period in alferon n injection had no sales of alferon n injection for the last nine months of sales of alferon n injection for the twelve months ended december  and amounted to approximately  and  respectively for a reduction of  or 
decreased general and administrative expenses of approximately  during the twelve months ended december  versus the same period a year 
decreased interest and other income of  or for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in decreased production cost of goods sold in of  being applied to inventory due to the halting of alferon n production 
in september  an increase of  in other income occurred due to the reversal of accrued liquidated damages in with respect to our debentures 
net loss per share was for the month period versus for the same period in revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program was down  and alferon n injection sales were down  or as compared to the prior period 
ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
this program has been in effect for several years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen  and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
revenues from our ampligen cost recovery program were down as fewer patients are participating in the program 
our clinical staff has not encouraged cost recovery clinical enrollments in order that our internal resources could address the ampligen nda and related documents preparatory to filing for a full commercial license 
the primary reason for the drop in the sales alferon for the twelve months ended december  is that commercial sales of alferon n injection were halted in march as the expiration date of our finished good inventory expired in march as a result  we had no product to sell for the last nine months of production costs cost of goods sold production cost of goods sold was approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and this represented a decrease of approximately  or as compared to the same period in these costs primarily represent costs of goods sold of approximately  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and  and costs to maintain alferon n injection inventory including storage  stability testing and reporting costs incurred in our attempt to have the fda extend the commercial sales life of our alferon n injection finished goods 
the primary reason for the decrease in cost of goods sold can be attributed to the lack of alferon n injection sales since april  and its impact on costs of goods sold 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the twelve months ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period a year ago reflecting a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced outside consulting fees and other costs related to the preparation and filing of our nda for ampligen 
in  we spent considerable time and effort preparing for the preapproval inspection by the fda for manufacturing of ampligen product and its raw materials  polynucleotides poly i and poly cu 
a satisfactory recommendation from the fda office of compliance based upon an acceptable preapproval inspection is required prior to approval of the product 
the preapproval inspection determines compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp as well as a product specific evaluation concerning the manufacturing process of product 
the inspection includes many aspects of the cgmp requirements  such as manufacturing process validation  equipment qualification  analytical method validation  facility cleaning  quality systems  documentation system and part compliance 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or primarily due to reductions in the cost of non cash stock compensation of  director fees for  impairment charges of  accounting fees of  and various other general administrative expenses that were partially offset by an increase of legal fees for  resulting from litigation to settle existing suits 
in  we incurred impairment charges amounting to  as compared to no such charges in the current year 
the primary reason for these charges stemmed from the  write down of a water purification system that was determined to be unnecessary at our new jersey facility due to a change in manufacturing plans 
additionally in  we wrote down the value of our intangible asset associated with the repurchase of a royalty on alferon n injection sales by  we determined in that we did not have sufficient inventory on hand to realize the full economic benefit of this asset  therefore  it was written down to its net realizable value 
reversal of previously accrued interest expense in september  an increase of  in other income occurred due to the reversal of accrued liquidated damages in with respect to our debentures holders 
these damages related to certain debenture covenants were settled without charge in the maturation and pay down of the debenture holder s outstanding loan balance in interest and other income interest and other income for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest and other income during the current period was mainly due to a reduction in funds available for short term investments compounded by the lower interest rates 
interest expense and financing costs we had no interest expense or non cash financing costs for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the same period a year prior 
the expenses reflected for the year ended reflect financing costs and interest charges related to our convertible debentures which matured in june when all outstanding loan balances were paid 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in  a reduction of  the cash used in operating activities was essentially flat and did not change significantly 
we had proceeds from financing activities of approximately  compared to  during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents or an increase of approximately  from december  in an effort to conserve our cash  the employee wage or hours reduction program the program was ratified by our board effective january  in a mandatory program that was estimated to be in effect for up to six months  compensation of all active full time employees as of january  participants were reduced through a reduction in their wages for which they would be eligible to receive shares of our common stock stock six months after the shares were earned 
while all employees were also offered the option to reduce their work hours with a proportional decease in wages  of which none elected this alternative 
on a semi monthly basis  participants received rights to stock incentive rights that could not be traded 
six months after the date the incentive rights were awarded  we established a process to have incentive rights converted into stock and issued to each participant on a monthly basis 
we established and maintain a record for the number of incentive rights awarded to each participant 
at the end of each semi monthly period  we determined the number of incentive rights by converting the proportionate incentive award to the value of the stock by utilizing the closing price of the stock on the nyse amex based on the average daily closing price for the period 
the plan was administered for full time employees as follows o employees earning  or less per year elected a wage reduction of per annum and received an incentive of two times the value in stock  o employees earning  to  per year elected a wage reduction of per annum received an incentive of two times the value in stock  o employees earning over  per year elected a wage reduction of per annum and received an incentive of three times the value in stock  o any employee could have elected a per annum wage reduction which would allow them to be eligible for an incentive award of three times the value of stock 
we worked with wachovia securities  llc to establish a trading account for each participant 
incentive rights constitute income to the participants and be subject to payroll taxes upon stock issuance 
we will bear all expenses related to selling the stock at wachovia securities ie  broker fees  transaction costs  commissions  etc 
for payroll withholding tax purposes 
thereafter  for each participant that remains an active employee during the period  we will continue to bear such costs from their wachovia securities accounts for the maintenance of these account and all expenses related to selling our stock 
participants leaving us or voluntarily separating from the plan will receive the stock earned upon the six month conversion of their incentive rights 
the plan benefits for individuals that are no longer participants will become fixed and we will not continue to bear such costs from the designated brokerage firm for the maintenance of an account nor any expenses related to selling our stock except for the initial costs associated to the selling of stock for payroll withholding tax purposes 
the program was suspended as of may  with employees returning back to their rate of pay from january  at the passage of six months for each of their months of participation  non affiliate employees have been issued shares for the months ended july  august  september  october and november  individuals defined by rule in the securities act of as an affiliate have yet to receive their distribution of stock from the program 
in addition  certain vendors and service providers have agreed to accept shares of our common stock as partial payment of their bills 
we issued  and  shares of common stock for services rendered in and  respectively 
we have been using the proceeds from our financings with the assistance of rodman renshaw  llc rodman as placement agent and from fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital equity financing to fund operating expense and infrastructure growth including preparation for manufacturing  regulatory compliance and market development costs related to the fda approval process for ampligen 
we were able to raise in the aggregate of approximately  in equity financing pursuant to the two rodman financings in may and an aggregate of approximately  in equity financing pursuant to the fusion capital agreement 
for more details on the rodman and fusion capital financings  please see equity financing below 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory processes  including the commercializing of ampligen products 
notwithstanding our cost and spending reduction activities  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  especially considering current adverse market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders

the warrants include a cash settlement feature if certain conditions are met 
on july   we entered into a million common stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital  an illinois limited liability company 
concurrently with entering into the purchase agreement  we entered into a registration rights agreement with fusion capital 
under the registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement related to the transaction with the us securities exchange commission sec covering the shares that have been issued or may be issued to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement 
that registration statement was declared effective by the sec on august  as reported in the registration statement related to the transaction  we had the right over a month period from august to sell our shares of common stock to fusion capital from time to time in amounts between  and million depending on certain conditions as set forth in the agreement  up to a maximum of million 
the purchase price of the shares related to the million of future funding was based on the prevailing market prices of our shares at the time of sales as computed under the purchase agreement without any fixed discount  and we had control of the timing and amount of any sales of shares to fusion capital 
however  fusion capital could not purchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to the purchase agreement if the price of our common stock had three trading days with an average value below over the prior twelve trading days 
there were no negative covenants  restrictions on future funding  penalties or liquidated damages in the agreement 
in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  we issued to fusion capital  shares as a commitment fee 
also  we were to issue to fusion capital up to an additional  shares as a commitment fee pro rata as we receive up to the million of future funding 
as of september   fusion capital had purchased the maximum number of shares that were registered under the registration statement  an aggregate of  shares for  and received  commitment shares  thereby in effect exhausting the purchasing agreement 
under the rules of the nyse amex  we could issue no more than  shares of our outstanding shares as of july   the date of the purchase agreement without first obtaining the approval of stockholders 
that approval was obtained on november  as of december   we had executed transactions pursuant the fusion capital stock purchase agreement valued at  and  shares  which included  shares as the initial fee for the financing

because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
in this regard we also have previously registered  worth of our securities in a universal shelf registration statement  none of which has been designated or issued 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock or instruments convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory processes  including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
dollars in thousands obligations expiring by period contractual cash obligations total operating leases total new accounting pronouncements refer to note i recent accounting standards and pronouncements under notes to consolidated financial statements 
disclosure about off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenue from the sale of ampligen under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred 
inventories we use the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting for inventory 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years 
we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
stock based compensation under fasb asc compensation stock compensation asc share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of asc  using a modified prospective application 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
concentration of credit risk our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at and since december   we have had bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits 
concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process 
we do not require collateral on our receivables 
our receivables historically consisted principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies 
at december  there were no receivables and those at december  were fully reserved as doubtful accounts 
sales to three large wholesalers represented approximately of our total sales for the year ended december  there were no sales for year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding needs  we intend to invest the excess cash in money market accounts or three to eighteen month financial instruments 
we employ established conservative policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to investment exposure
