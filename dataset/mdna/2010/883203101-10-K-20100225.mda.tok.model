item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the global economic recession in significantly impacted many of our businesses as consumers and businesses reduced spending and investment 
the lower demand resulting from this environment contributed to a decline in revenue of billion to billion and a decline in segment profit of million to million 
these declines were largely due to lower volume in the cessna and industrial segments 
the impact of lower volume was partially offset by improved cost performance as we aligned our workforce and production levels with demand through our restructuring program  employee furloughs and temporary plant shutdowns 
revenue and segment profit also were adversely impacted by lower earnings and resulting operating losses in the finance segment largely due to an increase in portfolio losses  lower market interest rates and lower securitization income 
since our restructuring program was initiated at the end of  we have improved our cost structure by reducing our workforce by approximately  employees  representing approximately of our workforce  and by closing leased and owned facilities and plants 
this program has contributed to significant cost improvements in most of our businesses 
during the year  we continued to execute our plan to exit the non captive portion of the commercial finance business of our finance segment  while retaining the captive portion of the business that supports customer purchases of products that we manufacture 
we reduced our managed finance receivables by billion in through discounted payoffs  portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization and had a cash conversion ratio of 
this reduction included approximately million in finance receivables from our captive finance business 
the finance segment s on and off balance sheet debt was reduced by an aggregate of billion largely due to securitization payoffs and debt maturities 
we expect the finance segment to continue to contribute operating losses in as it liquidates the non captive portfolio 
our defense businesses continue to perform well  reflecting strong program performance 
at textron systems  revenues have been favorably impacted by higher volume largely due to higher shadow unmanned aircraft system and sensor fused weapon deliveries  partially offset by lower aircraft engine volume as aircraft manufacturers cut production levels in response to lower market demand 
at bell  higher military volumes from the v and other programs have been partially offset by the impact of the armed reconnaissance helicopter arh program cancellation and lower commercial helicopter deliveries 
backlog for our aircraft and defense businesses at the end of totaled billion  a decline from the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in backlog at cessna 
the decline in backlog at cessna reflects the cancellation of numerous business jet orders largely due to the economic recession and includes a billion impact from our decision to cancel the development of the citation columbus aircraft and a billion impact due to cancellations by one customer 
we expect ongoing volatility in our backlog at cessna until economic conditions stabilize 
backlog increased in the bell segment largely related to the multi year contract for the v during  we took several actions to ensure adequate liquidity and capital resources in light of the turmoil in the capital markets as summarized below in february  drew down on the balance of our billion committed bank credit lines given the risks associated with the capital markets at the time 
issued million of convertible notes and million of senior notes in may and september  respectively 
in may  concurrent with the convertible note offering  offered and sold to the public  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
extinguished billion of our outstanding debt securities with maturity dates ranging from to through open market repurchases and tender offers  resulting in a net gain of million 
we believe that  with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the non captive business and the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations  we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 
results of operations in our discussion of comparative results for the manufacturing group  changes in revenue and segment profit typically are expressed in terms of volume  pricing  foreign exchange and acquisitions 
additionally  changes in segment profit may be expressed in terms of mix  inflation and cost performance 
volume represents changes in the number of units delivered or services provided 
pricing represents changes in unit pricing 
foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign denominated amounts into us dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period 
acquisitions refer to the results generated from businesses that were acquired within the previous months 
for segment profit  
table of contents mix represents a change due to the composition of products and or services sold at different profit margins 
inflation represents higher material  wages  benefits or other costs 
cost performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development  depreciation  selling and administrative costs  warranty  product liability  quality scrap  labor efficiency  overhead  product line profitability  start up  ramp up and cost reduction initiatives  or other manufacturing inputs 
for the us government business  performance generally refers to changes in estimated contract rates 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs to complete a contract that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on the contract and are recognized by recording cumulative catch up adjustments in the current period 
revenues revenues decreased billion  or  to billion in  compared with this decrease is primarily due to the following factors lower manufacturing volume of billion  reflecting billion decrease at cessna  primarily related to fewer deliveries due to the economic recession  million decrease in the industrial segment  principally due to recession related lower demand  and a million decrease at bell largely related to lower commercial helicopter volume as a result of the economic recession 
lower finance segment revenues of million  reflecting an increase in portfolio losses  lower market interest rates and lower securitization income  and unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial segment  partially offset by higher pricing of million  with million at bell and million at cessna 
revenues increased billion  or  to billion in  compared with this increase is primarily due to the following factors in our manufacturing businesses  which were partially offset by lower revenues of million in the commercial finance business additional revenues from newly acquired businesses of million  primarily the acquisition of aai at textron systems  higher manufacturing volume of million  reflecting million in higher volume at cessna  primarily related to an increase in business jet deliveries  million in higher volume at bell  largely related to the v and h programs  and million in increased volume at textron systems from higher armored security vehicle aftermarket  lycoming and intelligent battlefield systems products  partially offset by million decrease in the industrial segment  principally due to lower demand at kautex  higher pricing of million  with million at cessna  million at bell and million in the industrial segment  and favorable foreign exchange impact of million in the industrial segment 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of manufacturing revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to the impact of lower production levels and temporary plant shutdowns in the cessna and industrial segments resulting in increased conversion costs and idle capacity 
the increase in is largely due to higher product development costs  primarily at cessna related to the development of new citation models and inventory writedowns taken at cessna at the end of  largely related to pre owned aircraft 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expense decreased million to  million in  compared with  primarily due to workforce reductions and furlough programs resulting in lower compensation and related costs  lower sales commissions at cessna  and a decline in professional service and travel costs due to cost reduction efforts 
in  selling and administrative expense increased million to  million  compared with  primarily due to an increase in commission expense from higher business jet sales and higher operating expenses resulting from the acquisition of aai in  partially offset by lower compensation expense largely caused by stock depreciation 
special charges special charges include restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively 
in  special charges also includes a goodwill impairment charge of million in the industrial segment  which is discussed on page of note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we incurred other special charges of million in the finance segment in connection with our decision to exit the non captive portion of the commercial finance business 
these charges include the initial mark to market adjustment of million that was made when we classified certain finance receivables from held for investment to held for sale and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
there were no special charges in 
table of contents special charges by segment are as follows restructuring program contract curtailment terminations total severance charges  asset and total other special in millions costs net impairments other restructuring charges charges cessna finance corporate industrial bell textron systems cessna finance corporate industrial textron systems restructuring program in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overhead costs and improve productivity across the company  which includes corporate and segment direct and indirect workforce reductions and streamlining of administrative overhead  and announced the exit of portions of our commercial finance business 
this program was expanded in to include additional workforce reductions  primarily at cessna  corporate and bell  the cancellation of the citation columbus development project  the streamlining and reorganization of senior management and the consolidation of certain operations at cessna 
by the end of  we expect to have eliminated approximately  positions worldwide representing approximately of our global workforce since the inception of the program 
as of january   we have terminated approximately  employees and have exited leased and owned facilities and plants under this program 
we recorded net curtailment charges of million for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the second quarter of  as our analysis of the impact of workforce reductions on these plans indicated that curtailments had occurred and that the amounts could be reasonably estimated 
the curtailment charge for the pension plan is primarily due to the recognition of prior service costs that previously were being amortized over a period of years 
asset impairment charges included a million charge recorded in the second quarter of to write off assets related to the citation columbus development project 
due to the prevailing adverse market conditions and after analysis of the business jet market related to the product offering  cessna formally canceled the citation columbus development project in the second quarter of cessna began this project in early for the development of an all new  wide bodied  eight passenger business jet designed for international travel that would extend cessna s product offering as its largest business jet to date 
this development project had capitalized costs related to tooling and a partially constructed manufacturing facility  of which million was considered not to be recoverable 

table of contents since the inception of the restructuring program  we have incurred the following costs through january  curtailment contract severance charges  asset terminations total in millions costs net impairments and other restructuring cessna finance corporate industrial bell textron systems we estimate that we will incur approximately million in additional pre tax restructuring costs in  most of which will result in future cash outlays 
the additional costs are expected to primarily include relocation costs at cessna as it consolidates certain operations  severance in the cessna segment and million in severance for the finance segment 
we expect that the program will be substantially completed in  however  we expect to incur additional costs to exit the non captive portion of our commercial finance business over the next two to three years  which are estimated to be within a range of million to million  primarily attributable to severance and retention benefits 
interest expense interest expense includes interest for both the finance and manufacturing borrowing groups 
interest expense decreased million to million in  compared with  primarily due to reduced debt in the finance segment as it liquidates its non captive business 
interest expense  net for the manufacturing group increased million to million in  compared with  primarily due to million in interest on the convertible notes issued in the second quarter of  partially offset by lower rates in due to our borrowings from our bank lines of credit 
interest expense for the finance segment is included within segment profit 
in  interest expense decreased million to million  compared with  primarily due to the finance segment  reflecting lower interest rates  partially offset by higher average debt outstanding 
lower interest rates were primarily attributable to the decrease in market rate indices  partially offset by an increase in borrowing spreads 
interest expense  net for the manufacturing group increased million to million in  compared with  primarily due to higher borrowing costs associated with our commercial paper borrowings in income taxes the following table reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate federal statutory income tax rate increase decrease in taxes resulting from state income taxes goodwill impairment non us tax rate differential valuation allowance on contingent receipts research credit unrecognized tax benefits and related interest change in status of subsidiary manufacturing deduction equity hedge loss income other  net effective income tax rate 
table of contents in  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the adoption for canadian tax purposes  of the us dollar as the functional currency for one of our canadian subsidiaries  a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to the recognition of a capital gain in connection with the sale of the cescom assets and a reduction in a valuation allowance related to contingent payments on a prior year transaction  partially offset by a writeoff of non tax deductible goodwill in the industrial segment 
in  the effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the plan announced in the fourth quarter of to exit portions of the finance segment s business 
this plan resulted in the impairment of all of the finance segment s goodwill  of which only a small portion was deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  due to the change in the investment status of the finance segment s canadian subsidiary  we incurred million in additional tax expense 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes discontinued operations includes an million gain on the sale of hr textron in and a million gain on the sale of the fluid power business in  along with income loss from operations of these discontinued businesses prior to each disposition 
segment analysis we operate in  and report financial information for  the following five business segments cessna  bell  textron systems  industrial and finance 
segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense  certain corporate expenses and special charges 
the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges 
cessna dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog the deterioration in the global economy in significantly impacted the business jet market as evidenced by order cancellations and a decline in new aircraft orders 
in response to these conditions  cessna reduced its aircraft production schedule to align output with customer demand and reduced its headcount by approximately in see the special charges section regarding this restructuring program  including cancellation of the citation columbus development program in the second quarter of cessna revenues cessna s revenues decreased billion in  compared with  primarily due to lower volume in business jets and other aircraft  reflecting the impact of fewer deliveries due to the economic recession

the arh program included a development phase  covered by the system development and demonstration sdd contract  and a production phase 
we submitted our claim for the termination costs for the sdd contract in october and believe that these costs are fully recoverable from the us government 
prior to termination of the program  we obtained inventory and incurred vendor obligations for long lead time materials related to the anticipated lrip contracts to maintain the program schedule based on our belief that the lrip contracts would be awarded 
we have since terminated our vendor contracts and are negotiating to settle our termination obligations 
in october  we filed a claim with the us government to request reimbursement of costs expended in support of the lrip program

the plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected  depending on market conditions  to be substantially complete over the next two to three years 
the finance segment also announced a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of primarily related to headcount reductions and asset impairments resulting from the exit plan 
see special charges section on pages to regarding charges taken as a result of the exit plan  which are not reflected in segment profit

we increased the allowance for loan losses significantly in and in response to the economic recession  declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers 
we also increased our estimate of credit losses as a result of our decision to exit portions of the finance business in the fourth quarter of  which we believe will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio 
in  the increase was primarily due to an increase in both the rate and severity of defaults resulting from the economic recession and due to declining aircraft values 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in the provision for the distribution finance 
table of contents portfolio largely due to the liquidation of of its managed finance receivables in in  the increase in provision for loan losses was primarily a result of an million increase in defaults in the marine and recreational vehicles distribution finance portfolios  a million increase for the resort finance portfolio  a million reserve established for one account in the golf mortgage finance portfolio and a million reserve for one account in the asset based lending portfolio 
borrowing costs increased relative to the target federal funds rate as credit market volatility significantly impacted the historical relationships between market indices 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the spread between the london interbank offered rate libor and the target federal funds rate and from increased borrowing spreads on issuances of commercial paper in comparison with these increases were partially offset by increased receivable pricing as a result of variable rate receivables with interest rate floors 
finance portfolio quality the following table reflects information about the finance segment s credit performance related to finance receivables held for investment 
finance receivables held for sale are reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  finance receivables held for sale are not included in the credit performance statistics below 
january  january  dollars in millions finance receivables nonaccrual finance receivables allowance for losses ratio of nonaccrual finance receivables to finance receivables held for investment ratio of allowance for losses on finance receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables held for investment ratio of allowance for losses on finance receivables to finance receivables held for investment days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables repossessed assets and properties operating assets received in satisfaction of troubled finance receivables our nonaccrual finance receivables include impaired finance receivables  as well as accounts in homogeneous loan portfolios that are not considered to be impaired but are contractually delinquent by more than three months 
we believe that the percentage of nonaccrual finance receivables generally will remain high as we execute our liquidation plan under the current economic conditions 
the liquidation plan is also likely to result in a slower pace of liquidations for nonaccrual finance receivables 
the ratio of allowance for losses to nonaccrual finance receivables held for investment decreased primarily as a result of certain nonaccrual timeshare and aviation accounts for which specific reserves were either not established due to sufficient collateral values and other considerations  or were established at a percentage of the outstanding balance based on the expectation of partial recovery 
this reflects our best estimate of loss based on a detailed review of our workout strategy and estimates of collateral value 
the increase in operating assets received in satisfaction of troubled finance receivables primarily reflects an increase in the number of golf courses for which ownership was transferred to us from the borrower in we intend to operate and improve the performance of these properties prior to their eventual disposition 

table of contents a summary of these finance receivables and the related allowance for losses by collateral type is as follows january  january  allowance allowance for losses for losses impaired on impaired impaired on impaired nonaccrual nonaccrual nonaccrual nonaccrual nonaccrual nonaccrual finance finance finance finance finance finance collateral type in millions receivables receivables receivables receivables receivables receivables timeshare notes receivable general aviation aircraft golf course property resort construction inventory dealer inventory hotels other total finance receivables collateralized primarily by timeshare notes receivable also maybe collateralized by certain real estate and other assets of our borrowers 
the increase in nonaccrual finance receivables primarily is attributable to the lack of liquidity available to borrowers in the timeshare portfolio  weaker general economic conditions and depressed aircraft values 
the increase in timeshare notes receivable includes one million account  of which million is collateralized by notes receivable and million is collateralized by several resort properties  which are included in the resort construction inventory line above 
liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups 
the manufacturing group consists of textron inc consolidated with its majority owned subsidiaries that operate in the cessna  bell  textron systems and industrial segments 
the finance group  which is also the finance segment  consists of textron financial corporation tfc  its subsidiaries and the securitization trusts consolidated into it  along with two other finance subsidiaries owned by textron inc we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group 
our manufacturing group operations include the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services  while our finance group provides financial services 
due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities  investors  rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance 
to support those evaluations  we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 
key information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below dollars in millions manufacturing group cash and cash equivalents total debt total equity total capital debt plus equity net debt to capital net of cash and cash equivalents gross debt to capital free cash flow finance group cash and cash equivalents securitized off balance sheet debt total debt on balance sheet free cash flow represents a non gaap measure 
see page for a reconciliation to gaap 

table of contents we believe that with our existing cash balances  coupled with the continued successful execution of the exit plan for the non captive portion of the commercial finance business  and cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations  we will have sufficient cash to meet our future needs 
during  we proceeded with our plan to exit the non captive commercial finance business in our finance segment 
we made the decision to exit this business in the fourth quarter of in order to address our long term liquidity position in light of disruption and instability in the capital markets 
the plan is being effected through a combination of orderly liquidation and selected sales and is expected  depending on market conditions  to be substantially complete over the next two to three years 
we reduced our managed finance receivables by billion in through discounted payoffs  portfolio sales and finance receivable amortization  which included approximately million in finance receivables from our captive finance business 
managed finance receivables include owned finance receivables that are recorded on our balance sheets and finance receivables sold in securitizations where we have retained credit risk to the extent of our subordinated interest  which may or may not be recorded on our balance sheets 
the reduction in managed finance receivables was primarily driven by the accelerated pace of liquidations in the distribution finance product line 
distribution finance receivables typically have short duration associated with the sales pace of equipment dealer inventory and this natural liquidation pattern was accelerated by asset sales  discounted payoff programs and the transfer of borrowers with revolving credit lines to new lenders 
we measure the progress of the exit plan  in part  based on the percentage of managed finance receivable and other finance asset reductions converted to cash 
in  we had a cash conversion ratio of 
we expect the cash conversion ratio to decline over the duration of our exit plan due to the change in mix from shorter term assets in the distribution finance and asset based lending product lines to longer term assets in our timeshare  golf mortgage and structured finance product lines and the existence of a higher concentration of nonaccrual finance receivables 
at the end of  the exit plan applied to the remaining billion of the finance segment s non captive managed finance receivables portfolio 
in  we expect a total reduction in managed finance receivables of approximately billion  net of originations  which includes non captive finance receivables  as well as captive finance receivables 
in connection with the liquidation of our managed finance receivables  we have reduced our finance group s on and off balance sheet debt portfolio by an aggregate of billion largely due to the payoff of the distribution finance and golf securitizations and debt maturities 
in february  due to the unavailability of term debt and difficulty in accessing sufficient commercial paper on a daily basis  we drew the available balance from our aggregate billion in committed bank lines of credit 
amounts borrowed under the credit facilities are due in april a portion of the proceeds was used to repay our outstanding commercial paper 
these facilities historically have been in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only  and  at the end of  there were no borrowings outstanding related to the manufacturing group s billion facility or the finance group s billion facility 
during  the capital markets improved  and we were able to successfully access these markets to strengthen our current and future liquidity profile 
we maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities 
on may   we issued million of convertible senior notes convertible notes under our registration statement 
see note to the consolidated financial statement for more information on these convertible notes 
concurrently with the offering and sale of the convertible notes  we also offered and sold to the public under our registration statement  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
to further lengthen the maturity profile of our indebtedness  on september   we issued million of senior notes under our registration statement  comprised of million of notes due and million of notes due both borrowing groups extinguished through open market repurchases an aggregate of million in outstanding debt securities prior to maturity during  resulting in gains of million 
also in  both borrowing groups completed separate cash tender offers for up to a million aggregate principal amount of five separate series of outstanding debt securities with maturity dates ranging from november to june in completing these tender offers  we extinguished an aggregate of million of outstanding debt securities with maturity dates ranging from to and recognized a loss of million in we also have pursued new funding sources and transfers of existing funding obligations to new financing providers 
in july  we entered into a credit agreement with the export import bank of the united states that established a million credit facility to provide funding to finance purchases of cessna and bell aircraft by non us customers who take delivery of new aircraft by december during the second quarter  we transferred the rights to financing programs with two large manufacturers of lawn and garden products in the distribution finance business  which will reduce future originations 
similarly  in early april  we entered into a three year agreement with a financial service company that now provides financing to third parties for a portion of our sales of e z go golf cars 

table of contents credit ratings the major rating agencies regularly evaluate both borrowing groups  and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength and factors outside our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
at the beginning of  our credit ratings were downgraded  and the rating agencies cited concerns about textron financial corporation  including execution risks associated with our plan to exit portions of our commercial finance business and the need for textron inc to make capital contributions to textron financial corporation  as well as lower expected earnings  the increase in outstanding debt resulting from the borrowing under our bank lines of credit  weak economic conditions and liquidity and funding constraints 
on february   moody s investors service affirmed its ratings of both borrowing groups and changed its rating outlook to stable from negative  reflecting improved liquidity at textron inc and better than expected progress in the ongoing liquidation of tfc s non captive assets

manufacturing group cash flows free cash flow is a measure generally used by investors  analysts and management to gauge a company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of that necessary to be reinvested to sustain and grow the business 
our definition of manufacturing free cash flow uses net cash from operating activities of continuing operations and subtracts dividends received from the finance group and capital expenditures  then adds back capital contributions provided under a support agreement with tfc  as discussed below  plus proceeds from the sale of plant  property and equipment 
we believe that our manufacturing free cash flow calculation provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to fund operations 
this measure is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should be used in conjunction with gaap cash measures provided in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
our manufacturing free cash flow measure may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies as there is no definitive accounting standard on how the measure should be calculated 
a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities of continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows to manufacturing free cash flow is provided below 
in millions net cash from operating activities of continuing operations gaap less dividends received from the finance group plus capital contributions paid to finance group less capital expenditures plus proceeds on sale of property  plant and equipment manufacturing free cash flow non gaap our manufacturing group s free cash flow improved by million in  compared with  as lower capital expenditures of million and working capital improvements offset lower earnings and an increase in cash paid for restructuring activities 
cash used for restructuring activities totaled million in  compared with million in and none in in  free cash flow decreased million largely due to a higher investment in inventories related to increased production levels and inventory build at bell and cessna and a million increase in capital expenditures in connection with the ramp up of production 

table of contents cash flows from continuing operations for the manufacturing group as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities increased million in  compared with  largely due to million in lower capital contributions paid to the finance group  net of dividends received  and working capital improvements  partially offset by lower earnings 
we used million in working capital in  compared with million in  largely related to significant inventory reductions 
in  cash flow from operating activities decreased  primarily due to a million capital contribution made to the finance group 
investing cash flows in  and primarily include capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in is largely due to a reduction in discretionary spending due to the economic recession 
in addition  in and  we paid million and billion  respectively  for acquisitions  primarily related to aai 
financing activities provided more cash in  compared with  primarily due to the draw of our billion on bank lines of credit  a portion of which was used to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings  net proceeds of million from the issuance of the convertible notes net of hedge  million in cash from the issuance of our common stock and common stock warrants  million in net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and a decrease in dividends paid 
these increases in cash provided were partially offset by an million decrease in commercial paper borrowings in  compared with an million increase in these borrowings in in addition  we made million in payments to settle advances against our company owned officer life insurance policies in  while in  we received million in advances against these policies 
we have not repurchased any of our common stock other than in connection with an executive compensation award since we suspended all share repurchase activity under our repurchase program in september under board authorized share repurchase programs  we spent million in and million in for share repurchases representing approximately million and million shares of common stock  respectively 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had voted to reduce our quarterly dividend to per share for the first quarter of in an effort to increase our liquidity in the long term interest of our shareholders 
accordingly  the annual dividend decreased to in from in dividend payments to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in four payments  compared with three payments in capital contributions paid to and dividends received from the finance group under a support agreement between textron inc and tfc  textron inc 
is required to maintain a controlling interest in tfc 
the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that tfc maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than and consolidated shareholder s equity of no less than million 
due to a goodwill impairment charge of million at tfc  along with other charges resulting from the exit plan discussed above  on december   textron inc was required to make a cash payment to tfc  which was reflected as a capital contribution  to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement and to maintain the leverage ratio required by its credit facility 
cash contributions paid to tfc and dividends paid by tfc to textron inc are detailed below 
in millions dividends paid by tfc to textron inc capital contributions paid to tfc under support agreement an additional cash contribution of million was made to tfc on january  to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement 

table of contents due to the nature of these contributions  we classify these contributions within cash flows used by operating activities for the manufacturing group in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
capital contributions to support finance group growth in the ongoing captive finance business are classified as cash flows from financing activities 
the finance group s net income loss is excluded from the manufacturing group s cash flows  while dividends from the finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment 
finance group cash flows the cash flows from continuing operations for the finance group are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities we generated cash from investing activities in the finance group as new finance receivable originations declined to billion in from billion in as we effected our exit plan for the non captive business 
finance receivables repaid and proceeds from sales and securitizations decreased to billion in from billion in in  cash used in investing activities decreased from  primarily due to a decrease in finance receivable originations  net of collections and sale proceeds  largely related to our decision to exit the non captive business  resulting in lower originations 
the finance group used more cash for financing activities in  compared with  primarily due to the repayment of debt and commercial paper in  totaling billion  compared with billion in the finance group s financing outflows were partially offset by billion in proceeds from the first quarter drawdown on its bank lines of credit 
in  proceeds from the issuance of long term debt totaled billion 
in and  the manufacturing group agreed to lend the finance group  with interest  funds to pay down maturing debt 
as of january  and january   the outstanding balance due to the manufacturing group was million and million  respectively 
the finance group received million in capital contributions from the manufacturing group in  compared with million in  to enable it to maintain compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio required by the support agreement 
in addition  the finance group paid million more in dividends to the manufacturing group in  compared with more cash was used for financing activities in  compared with  primarily due to an increase in debt payments  partially offset by the capital contribution received from the manufacturing group and lower proceeds from borrowings related to the reduction in managed receivable growth 
consolidated cash flows the consolidated cash flows from continuing operations  after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups  are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities increased  primarily due to working capital improvements  largely related to a reduction in inventory  partially offset by lower earnings and an increase in cash used in connection with our restructuring program 
we received more cash from investing activities  primarily due to the finance group s exit plan  which resulted in lower finance receivable originations 
in  billion in cash was used for acquisitions  primarily related to aai 
more cash was used for financing activities as we repaid billion in maturing long term debt  including early debt extinguishments  compared with billion in this use was partially offset by the receipt of billion from drawing on our lines of credit  which was partially offset by a billion decrease in commercial paper borrowings in  compared with a million increase in net commercial paper borrowings in we also used more cash in for stock repurchases and dividend payments  compared with as discussed in the manufacturing group cash flow section 
in  we received less cash from financing activities  compared with  primarily due to million in lower proceeds from borrowings  net of principal payments 

table of contents captive financing and other intercompany transactions the finance group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group  otherwise known as captive financing 
in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties 
however  in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups  cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group 
for example  when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the finance group  the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the finance group s statement of cash flows 
meanwhile  in the manufacturing group s statement of cash flows  the cash received from the finance group on the customer s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow 
although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups  there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing 
these captive financing activities  along with all significant intercompany transactions  are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
reclassification and elimination adjustments included in the consolidated statement of cash flows are summarized below in millions reclassifications from investing activities finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales cash received from customers  sale of receivables and securitizations capital contributions made to cessna export finance corp 
other total reclassifications from investing activities reclassifications from financing activities capital contribution paid by manufacturing group to finance group dividends received by manufacturing group from finance group capital contributions made to cessna export finance corp 
total reclassifications from financing activities total reclassifications and adjustments to cash flow from operating activities in  captive finance receivable originations have decreased largely due to lower aircraft sales 
in addition  in april  we signed a three year agreement with a financial services company that now provides financing to third parties for a portion of our sales of e z go golf cars 
we expect this agreement to reduce future finance receivable originations in this business 
consolidated discontinued operations cash flows the cash flows from discontinued operations are summarized below in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash flows from investing activities primarily include approximately million in after tax net proceeds upon the sale of hr textron  partially offset by million in tax payments related to the sale of the fluid power business 
in the fourth quarter of  we received net cash proceeds from the sale of the fluid power business of approximately million 
in  cash flows from investing activities are primarily related to the realization of cash tax benefits from the fastening systems business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning these dispositions 

table of contents contractual obligations finance group due to the nature of finance companies  we believe that it is meaningful to include contractual cash receipts that we expect to receive in the future 
the following table summarizes the finance group s liquidity position  including all managed finance receivables and both on and off balance sheet funding sources as of january   for the specified years payments receipts due by period and in millions thereafter total payments due multi year bank lines of credit term debt securitized on balance sheet debt subordinated debt securitized off balance sheet debt interest on borrowings operating lease rental payments total payments due cash and contractual receipts finance receivable held for investment finance receivable held for sale securitized off balance sheet finance receivables and cash receipts interest receipts on finance receivables operating lease rental receipts total contractual receipts cash total cash and contractual receipts net cash and contractual receipts payments cumulative net cash and contractual receipts excludes cash that may be generated by the disposal of operating lease residual assets and other assets in addition to cash that may be used to pay future income taxes  accrued interest and other liabilities 
securitized on balance sheet and securitized off balance sheet debt payments are based on the contractual receipts of the underlying receivables  which are remitted into the securitization structure when and as they are received 
these payments do not represent contractual obligations of the finance group  and we do not provide legal recourse to investors who purchase interests in the securitizations beyond the credit enhancement inherent in the retained subordinate interests 
interest payments and receipts reflect the current interest rate paid or received on the related debt and finance receivables 
they do not include anticipated changes in either market interest rates or changes in borrower performance  which could have an impact on the interest rate according to the terms of the related debt or finance receivable contract 
finance receivable receipts are based on contractual cash flows only and do not reflect any reserves for uncollectible amounts 
these receipts could differ due to sales  prepayments  charge offs and other factors  including the inability of borrowers to repay the balance of the loan at the contractual maturity date 
finance receivable receipts on the held for sale portfolio represent the contractual balance of the finance receivable and  therefore  exclude the potential negative impact from selling the portfolio at the estimated fair value 
this liquidity profile is an indicator of the finance group s ability to repay outstanding funding obligations  assuming contractual collection of all finance receivables  absent access to new sources of liquidity or origination of additional finance receivables 
in addition  at january   our finance group had million in other liabilities  primarily including accounts payable and accrued expenses  that are payable within the next months 

table of contents at january   the finance group had million of unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under revolving lines of credit  construction loans and equipment loans and leases 
these commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years  and funding under these facilities is dependent on the availability of eligible collateral and compliance with customary financial covenants 
since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we also have ongoing customer relationships  including manufacturers and dealers in the distribution finance product line  which do not contractually obligate us to provide funding  however  we may choose to fund under certain of these relationships to facilitate an orderly liquidation and mitigate credit losses 
neither of these potential fundings is included as contractual obligations in the table above 
manufacturing group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations  as defined by reporting regulations  of our manufacturing group as of january   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied payments due by year and in millions thereafter total liabilities reflected in balance sheet multi year credit facilities long term debt interest on borrowings capital lease obligations pension benefits for unfunded plans postretirement benefits other than pensions other long term liabilities liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations total manufacturing group we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually  consistent with applicable laws and regulations  however  future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table since the future cash outflows are uncertain 
we expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million in based on our current assumptions  which may change with changes in market conditions  our current contribution estimates for each of the years from through are estimated to be in the range of approximately million to million under the plan provisions in place at this time 
other long term liabilities included in the table consist primarily of undiscounted amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as of january   representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
the timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience 
other long term liabilities  such as deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits and product liability reserves  have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of january  the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 

table of contents critical accounting estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment we evaluate our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment based on a combination of factors 
for homogeneous loan pools  we examine current delinquencies  the characteristics of the existing accounts  historical loss experience  the value of the underlying collateral  general economic conditions and trends  and the potential impact of the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers as a result of our current decision to exit our non captive finance business 
we estimate losses will range from to of finance receivables held for investment depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool 
for larger balance commercial loans  we also consider borrower specific information  industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows 
provision for losses on finance receivables held for investment is charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment at a level considered adequate to cover losses inherent in the owned finance receivable held for investment portfolio based on management s evaluation and analysis of this portfolio 
while management believes that its consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above does result in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience  changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment 
the allowance for losses on finance receivables held for investment currently represents of total finance receivables held for investment 
during the last five years  net charge offs as a percentage of finance receivables held for investment have ranged from to finance receivables held for sale finance receivables are classified as held for sale based on the determination that we no longer intend to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future  until maturity or payoff  or there no longer is the ability to hold to maturity 
our decision to classify certain finance receivables as held for sale is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  contractual duration  type of collateral  credit strength of the borrowers  the existence of continued contractual commitments and the perceived marketability of the receivables 
on an ongoing basis  these factors  combined with our overall liquidation strategy  determine which finance receivables we have the positive intent to hold for the foreseeable future and which receivables we will hold for sale 
our current strategy is based on an evaluation of both our performance and liquidity position and changes in external factors affecting the value and or the marketability of our finance receivables 
a change in this strategy could result in a change in the classification of our finance receivables 
as a result of the significant influence of economic and liquidity conditions on our business plans and strategies  and the rapid changes in these and other factors we utilize to determine which assets are classified as held for sale  we currently believe the term foreseeable future represents a time period of six to nine months 
we also believe that unanticipated changes in both internal and external factors affecting our financial performance  liquidity position or the value and or marketability of our finance receivables could result in a modification of this assessment 
if we determine that finance receivables classified as held for sale will not be sold and we have the intent and ability to hold the finance receivables for the foreseeable future  until maturity or payoff  the finance receivables are reclassified to held for investment at the lower of cost or fair value at that time 
conversely  if we determine that there are other finance receivables that we determine we no longer intend or have the ability to hold to maturity  these receivables would be designated as held for sale  and a valuation allowance would be established at that time  if necessary 
at january   if we had classified additional finance receivables as held for sale  a valuation allowance would likely have been required at that time based on the fair value estimates we completed for our footnote disclosure requirements 
see page in note to the consolidated financial statements for a table where we have included the carrying value and fair value for the assets and liabilities that currently are not recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
finance receivables held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
at the time of transfer to the held for sale classification  we establish a valuation allowance for any shortfall between the carrying value  net of all deferred fees and costs  and fair value 
upon the initial classification to held for sale  any shortfall is recorded as a charge within special charges 
in addition  any allowance for loan losses previously allocated to 
table of contents these finance receivables is reclassified to the valuation allowance account  which is netted with finance receivables held for sale on the balance sheet 
after the valuation allowance is initially established  it is adjusted quarterly for any changes in the fair value of the receivables below the carrying value  with subsequent adjustments included in earnings within segment profit 
fair value changes can occur based on market interest rates  market liquidity and changes in the credit quality of the borrower and value of underlying loan collateral 
there are no active  quoted market prices for our finance receivables 
the estimate of fair value was determined based on the use of discounted cash flow models to estimate the exit price we expect to receive in the principal market for each type of loan in an orderly transaction  which includes the sale of both pools of similar assets and the sale of individual loans 
the models we used incorporate estimates of the rate of return  financing cost  capital structure and or discount rate expectations of prospective purchasers combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses  payment rates and credit line utilization rates 
where available  the assumptions related to the expectations of prospective purchasers were compared with observable market inputs  including bids from prospective purchasers  and certain bond market indices for loans of similar perceived credit quality 
although we utilize and prioritize these market observable inputs in our discounted cash flow models  these inputs are rarely derived from markets with directly comparable loan structures  industries and collateral types 
therefore  all valuations of finance receivables held for sale involve significant management judgment  which can result in differences between our fair value estimates and those of other market participants and the sale price that we may ultimately recover 
long term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts 
these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
we account for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenues and cost of a contract 
we then recognize that estimated profit over the contract term based on either the costs incurred under the cost to cost method  which typically is used for development effort or the units delivered under the units of delivery method  which is used for production effort  as appropriate under the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and  in some cases  includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements  complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit might be impaired 
goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment using a two step process 
in step  companies are required to estimate fair value of their reporting units  which may be done using various methodologies  including the income method using discounted cash flows 
if its estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value  the reporting unit is not impaired  and no further analysis is performed 
otherwise  the amount of the impairment must be determined in step of the goodwill impairment test 
in step  the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assigning a fair value to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at fair value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 

table of contents fair values are established primarily using discounted cash flows that incorporate assumptions for the unit s short and long term revenue growth rates  operating margins and discount rates  which represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions  current cost structure  anticipated net cost reductions  and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
the revenue growth rates and operating margins used in our discounted cash flow analysis are based on our businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the long term growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate  as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product  inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 
we utilize a weighted average cost of capital in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our annual test in the fourth quarter of resulted in an impairment charge of million in the golf turf reporting unit 
the fair value of all the other reporting units exceeded their carrying values  and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any of these units might fail the step impairment test in the foreseeable future 
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
we evaluate and update these assumptions annually 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in in and  the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans  which represent approximately of our total pension assets  was 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return in would have resulted in a million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in for our domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was in  compared with for a basis point decrease in this discount rate in would have resulted in a million increase in pension expense for our domestic plans 
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits 
the medical rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 

table of contents warranty liabilities we provide limited warranty and product maintenance programs  including parts and labor  for certain products for periods ranging from one to five years 
a significant portion of these liabilities arises from our commercial aircraft businesses 
we also may incur costs related to product recalls 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under warranty programs and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold  historical costs per claim  contractual recoveries from vendors  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  including production and warranty patterns for new models 
during our initial aircraft model launches  we typically incur higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs moderate 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty and product maintenance liabilities periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and actual experience warrant 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying tax rates expected to be enacted for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse or settle 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in a valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
interest and penalties are accrued  where applicable 
we recognize net tax related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense 
if we do not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in the us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate exposures 
we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate exposures and adjust the mix  as necessary  sometimes by entering into interest rate exchange agreements  based on our evaluation of internal and external factors 
the manufacturing group did not enter into any interest rate exchange agreements in  and the difference between the rates received and the rates paid on interest exchange agreements did not have a material impact on interest expense in or our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at january   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were billion  after considering interest rate exchange agreements and the treatment of billion of floating rate loans with index rate floors as fixed rate loans 
these loans have index rates that are  on average  basis points above the applicable index rate predominately the prime rate 
the finance group has benefited from interest rate floor agreements in the recent low rate environment  however  in a rising rate environment  this benefit will dissipate until the prime rate exceeds the floor rates embedded in these agreements 
the net effect of interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt decreased interest expense for our finance group by million in and by million in and increased interest expense by million in foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which our products are manufactured and or sold 
the impact of foreign exchange rate changes for and from the prior year for each period is provided below 
in millions impact of foreign exchange rates increased decreased revenues segment profit for our manufacturing operations  we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing our foreign currency transaction exposures  we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options was approximately billion at the end of quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis
