item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand zoltek  our operations and our business environment 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes elsewhere in this report 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business  the industry in which we operate and the strategic initiatives on which we focus 
results of operations an analysis of our overall results of operations and segment results for the three fiscal years presented in our financial statements 
we operate in two principal segments carbon fiber and technical fiber 
other miscellaneous and corporate are combined into a third business segment called headquarters other 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  the potential impact of currency exchange and an overview of our financial position 
critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business executive overview we are an applied technology and advanced materials company 
our mission is to lead in the commercialization of carbon fiber through our development of a price competitive  high performance reinforcement for composites used in a broad range of commercial products which we sell under the panex trade name 
in addition to manufacturing carbon fiber  we produce an intermediate product that we refer to as technical fiber  a stabilized and oxidized acrylic fiber used in flame and heat resistant applications which we sell under the pyron trade name 
we have spent over years developing our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we believe that we are the largest capacity manufacturer primarily focused on producing low cost carbon fiber for commercial applications 
key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators within each of these segments to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
in the short term  management closely reviews the volume of product shipments and indicated customer requirements in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts 
in the longer term  management believes that revenue growth through sales to new customers in existing applications and new product applications are the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of commercializing carbon fiber 
we expect that new applications  including those we are attempting to facilitate  will continue to positively affect demand for our products 
gross profit 
our total gross margin for fiscal   and was  and  respectively 
management focuses on maintaining and improving the gross profit over the long term while leading the commercialization of carbon fiber and controlling associated costs 
as such  the company has maintained available unused capacity to remain poised to capture opportunities in emerging markets 
gross margin was negatively impacted by by available unused capacity costs of million in fiscal the primary cost components of our carbon fiber and technical fiber segments are acn  which is a propylene based product and our primary raw material for the production of acrylic fiber precursor used in our carbon fiber and technical fiber production and energy 
unscheduled shutdowns of acn production in europe coupled with an increase in demand for acn drove prices up more than during fiscal which placed additional pressure on our gross margins during the year 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven by headcount and related administrative costs  marketing costs and research and development costs 
we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
we believe that research and development expenditures will be the primary means by which we can facilitate new product applications 
cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities for fiscal   and was million  million  and million 
management believes that operating cash flow is meaningful to investors because it provides a view of zoltek with respect to sustainability of our ongoing operations and the extent to which we may or may not require external capital 
it also provides meaningful insight into the management of our working capital 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in revenue  our cash position varies 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly as they relate to operating cash flow  days sales outstanding  days payables outstanding and inventory turnover 
management aggressively pursues any late receivables and actively manages its inventory levels in order to effectively use it  working capital 
management also monitors debt levels and the financing costs associated with debt 
as of september   we had no long term borrowings  although we do maintain lines of credit 

table of contents business trends at the end of fiscal  we completed our expansion plans and essentially doubled our production capacity over the immediately preceding two fiscal years 
our capacity increase was completed just as world trade dropped and the global economy began to experience deep recession 
during fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a sudden  but we believe only temporary  slowdown in the growth of the wind turbine business 
this slowdown occurred at the same time as a significant decrease in the aerospace market due to unexpected delays in the introduction of new jetliners utilizing aerospace carbon fibers 
inasmuch as producers of carbon fibers for commercial and aerospace applications had greatly increased their installed capacity over the past few years  we have seen intensified competition between aerospace and commercial carbon fiber manufacturers in cross over applications eg  sporting goods for which either aerospace or commercial carbon fibers may be utilized 
in this business environment  management continued to focus its efforts on building on the long term vision of zoltek as the leader in commercialization of carbon fibers as a low cost but high performance reinforcement for composites 
management primarily emphasized the following areas increased sales efforts in selected international markets 
we have identified international markets with high growth potential for our existing and emerging commercial applications 
accordingly  we have added sales personnel and increased our marketing efforts in india  china  and korea 
business development in emerging applications 
we have identified emerging applications for our products with high growth potential across a variety of industries and regions 
in addition to producing carbon fibers for the existing prepreg technology used by our large wind turbine customers  we have recently begun shipments of carbon fibers qualified for use in the infusion process utilized by other wind turbine blade manufacturers 
we also are seeking to qualify our products for use in aerospace secondary structures such as floor  luggage bins and seats  and anticipate increased sales in this market as the production of new jetliners increases 
operating cash flows and cash management 
despite a decrease in sales  we had positive operating cash flows of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal reduced inventory levels provided cash of million in fiscal the company paid down the remaining outstanding balance of million of its convertible debt and reported million of capital expenditures during fiscal high raw material cost for fiscal unscheduled production shutdowns in europe of our primary raw material  acn  coupled with an increase in demand for acn drove market prices up more than and negatively impacted gross margins 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  the company s sales decreased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales volume to our largest customer declined by million as demand for their wind turbines declined and they moved to just in time inventory 
this reduction was  however  offset partially by an increase in volume of sales to other wind energy customers and other markets 
certain price reductions related to market pressures caused a million decrease in sales compared to fiscal carbon fiber sales decreased  or million  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal technical fiber sales increased  or million  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal technical fiber sales increased in fiscal primarily due to increased shipments to aircraft brake customers 
sales of other products and services consisting primarily of energy utility services provided to the local community by our hungarian subsidiary decreased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the company s cost of sales increased by or million  to million during fiscal from million during fiscal our raw material costs increased substantially as unscheduled shutdowns of acn production in europe coupled with an increase in demand for acn drove market prices up more than by the end of fiscal carbon fiber cost of sales increased by  or million  to million during fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of the increase in raw material costs and unscheduled shutdowns described above

the cost of sales of the corporate other products segment decreased by  or million to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal included in the company s cost of sales were available unused capacity costs of million 
these costs are comprised of fixed production costs allocated to manufacturing lines which were producing below normal levels and amounted to million for the carbon fiber segment and million for the technical fiber segment during fiscal the company believes maintaining this available unused capacity has been necessary to encourage development of significant large scale applications and maintain a level of readiness as we anticipate a return to more robust market conditions 
the cost of sales of other products decreased for fiscal to million compared to fiscal of million 

table of contents the company s gross profit decreased by  or million  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber gross profit percentage decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal carbon fiber gross profit decreased from million to million during these respective periods 
the decreases in carbon fiber gross profit and gross profit percentage resulted primarily from available unused capacity costs expensed during the fiscal year and price reductions discussed above

supply contracts we are party to long term supply contracts with our wind energy customers vestas wind systems and gamesa group 
vestas was the only customer which represented greater than of net sales for fiscal and in fiscal year and  we reported net sales of million and million to vestas wind systems  which represented and  respectively  of our net sales 
in fiscal  we reported net sales of million to vestas wind systems  which represented of our net sales and million to gamesa group  which represented of our net sales 
these were the only customers that represented greater than of consolidated net sales during any of these three years 
our current supply agreement with vestas wind systems was executed in may and obligates us to supply carbon fibers under a five year delivery schedule  and a rolling three year schedule as long as the supply agreement is in place 
under the agreement  vestas provides us with annual forecasts of its supply requirements  and we receive binding orders for shipments on approximately a monthly basis 
we are not guaranteed specific levels of sales under the agreement  and we are subject to liquidated damages if we are unable to perform our obligations under the agreement 
in general  the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties  by either party with at least months written notice  by either party as a result of a material breach of the agreement that is not remedied within days of receipt of notice of such breach  and by either party in the event of the bankruptcy  insolvency  or change of control of the other party 
our current supply agreement with gamesa group was executed in july and is effective through december   subject to automatic renewal for successive one year terms upon at least two years advance notice by gamesa to zoltek 
the agreement obligates zoltek to supply carbon fibers during the term of the contract provides based upon annual anticipated base volumes amounts  which are converted into binding orders for shipments on approximately a quarterly basis 
we are not guaranteed specific levels of sales under the agreement  and we are subject to liquidated damages if we are unable to perform our obligations under the agreement

the vestas agreement states that the warranty shall continue for a period of five years from the date of delivery of the products 
the gamesa agreement states that all products shall  as of the moment of delivery  be warranted for three years with regards to manufacture 

table of contents legal contingencies legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty 
when losses from contingencies become estimatable and probable  reserves are established 
the reserves reflect management s estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matters and are revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when matters are brought to closure 
if any litigation matter is resolved unfavorably  the company could incur obligations in excess of management s estimate of the outcome  and such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we anticipate that we will incur additional legal costs in connection with pursuing and defending such actions 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant legal matters 
critical accounting estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates  assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements  and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
accounts receivable collectibility the company evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with collection 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivable was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
the company historically has not experienced material problems related to the pricing or functionality of carbon fibers inventory 
our panex carbon fibers represent the majority of our inventory balance and are available in continuous tow  fabric  prepreg  chopped  and milled forms 
generally  technical obsolescence and spoilage have not historically been a concern because nonqualifying produced items can be reclaimed for processing for sale in secondary markets 
available unused capacity costs for fiscal were comprised of fixed production costs allocated to manufacturing lines which were producing below normal levels during the year 
the company reviews monthly production levels of all manufacturing lines for all products 
any lines which produced at a rate below a historical range of normal capacity were identified and the fixed costs associated with those lines were calculated 
the unallocated costs were recognized as an expense in the period in which they were incurred 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
zoltek management is responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present 
the company expects that the components of each operating segment will exhibit similar financial performance over the long term and  therefore  groups assets accordingly for analyzing whether impairment exists 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 

table of contents contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations  and other claims related to employment  environmental  service providers  supply agreements  taxing authorities  and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes adjusted for various differences between tax law and gaap accounting 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year

at variable rates and a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated our interest expense for the twelve months ended september  would have changed by approximately million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we would seek to take actions to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
further  no consideration has been given to the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
the company does not believe such risk is material because of the company s relatively low debt and because a significant amount of the company s current debt is at fixed rates 
at september   the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding
