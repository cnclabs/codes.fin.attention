item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with gallagher s consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that are included elsewhere herein 
gallagher is engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third party property casualty p c claims settlement and administration services to entities in the us and abroad 
gallagher believes that one of its major strengths is its ability to deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to its clients 
gallagher s brokers  agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and gallagher does not assume underwriting risks 
gallagher is headquartered in itasca  illinois  has operations in fifteen countries and does business in more than countries globally through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants 
gallagher generates approximately of its revenues domestically  with the remaining derived in australia  bermuda  canada  new zealand and the uk gallagher operates three business segments brokerage  risk management and financial services and corporate  which contributed approximately  and less than  respectively  to revenues 
the two major sources of operating revenues for gallagher are commissions and fees from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations 
investment income and other revenue is generated from gallagher s investment portfolio  which includes invested cash and fiduciary funds  as well as alternative energy clean energy tax advantaged investments and venture capital funds 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of please see information concerning forward looking statements in part i of this annual report  for certain cautionary information regarding forward looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements 
insurance market overview fluctuations in premiums charged by p c insurance carriers carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry 
commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds and normally follow premium levels 
insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions 
various factors  including competition for market share among insurance carriers  increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations  can result in flat or reduced p c premium rates a soft market 
a soft market tends to put downward pressure on commission revenues 
various countervailing factors  such as heavier than anticipated loss experience and capital shortages  can result in increasing p c premium rates a hard market 
a hard market tends to favorably impact commission revenues 
hard and soft markets may be broad based or more narrowly focused across individual product lines or geographic areas 
as markets harden  there historically has been resistance among certain insureds  who are the buyers of insurance gallagher s brokerage clients  to pay increased premiums and the higher commissions generated by these premiums 
such resistance often causes some buyers to raise their deductibles and or reduce the overall amount of insurance coverage they purchase 
as the market softens  or costs decrease  these trends have historically reversed 
during a hard market  buyers may switch to negotiated fee in lieu of commission arrangements to compensate gallagher for placing their risks  or may consider the alternative insurance market  which includes self insurance  captives  rent a captives  risk retention groups and capital market solutions to transfer risk 
according to industry estimates  these mechanisms account for almost of the total us commercial p c market 
gallagher s brokerage units are very active in these markets as well 
while increased use by insureds of these alternative markets historically has reduced commission revenue to gallagher  such trends generally have been accompanied by new sales and renewal increases in the areas of risk management  claims management  captive insurance and self insurance services and related growth in fee revenue 

table of contents inflation tends to increase the levels of insured values and risk exposures  thereby resulting in higher overall premiums and higher commissions 
however  the impact of hard and soft market fluctuations historically has had a greater impact on changes in premium rates  and therefore on gallagher s revenues  than inflationary pressures 
beginning in and continuing throughout  the p c insurance market has been operating in a relatively soft market in most lines and in most geographic areas 
for example  surveys by the council of insurance agents brokers ciab indicated that commercial p c rates fell during first  second and third quarters of the average premium decline for all commercial accounts  regardless of size  was for first quarter  for second quarter and for third quarter 
a similar survey by the ciab indicated that commercial p c rates fell again during fourth quarter by an average of for all commercial accounts  regardless of size 
according to the most recent survey  the rates for small  medium and large business accounts declined slightly less than rates in the third quarter 
strong competition for new business by carriers looking to increase market share in a still weak economy continued the downward pressure on rates 
in addition  insureds also added to the downward pressure on rates in the quarter as they negotiated to get the best terms and rates from the carriers 
the ciab does not expect to see pricing turn upward until demand picks up and capacity in the market place diminishes 
the ciab represents the leading domestic and international insurance brokers  who write approximately of the commercial p c premiums in the us historically  gallagher has utilized acquisitions to grow its brokerage segment s commission and fee revenues 
acquisitions allow gallagher to expand into desirable geographic locations and further extend its presence in the retail and wholesale insurance brokerage services industries 
gallagher expects that its brokerage segment s commission and fee revenues will continue to grow from acquisitions 
gallagher is considering  and intends to continue to consider from time to time  additional acquisitions on terms that it deems advantageous 
at any particular time  gallagher generally will be engaged in discussions with multiple acquisition candidates 
however  no assurances can be given that any additional acquisitions will be consummated  or  if consummated  that they will be advantageous to gallagher 
the disruption in the global credit markets  the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets in and  particularly in the us and europe  have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions  including participants in the insurance industry 
continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets and a recessionary environment may reduce gallagher s customers demand for its brokerage and risk management services and could negatively affect gallagher s results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages that gallagher offers to its brokerage customers could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry  which in turn could have the effect of reduced placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduced revenues and profitability for gallagher 
in addition  the deterioration in the economy that occurred in fourth quarter and throughout  could adversely impact gallagher in and future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that its clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount  payroll  properties  market values of assets  etc 
such reductions could also adversely impact gallagher s and future years commission revenues when exposure audits by the carriers are performed and if subsequent downward premium adjustments are determined 
the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known and  as a result  any improvement in gallagher s results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy 
in addition  some of gallagher s clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy 
if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that gallagher offers its clients  overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected  which could reduce gallagher s placement of certain lines and types of insurance and  as a result  reduce its revenues and profitability 
the failure of an insurer with whom gallagher places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by gallagher s clients  which could adversely affect gallagher s results of operations and financial condition 
as discussed in more detail in the financial services and corporate section  gallagher has made capital expenditures and commitments totaling million as of december   to build eight commercial clean energy facilities 
in january  gallagher has sold a portion of three of the facilities  recouping million of its million capital investment  and is in the process of finding partners for the remaining five facilities 
throughout  gallagher and its current and future partners will seek to optimize the operations of the facilities and finalize necessary regulatory operating requirements 
once fully operational  gallagher could generate up to million of aggregate annual after tax income through a combination of pretax income and tax credits under irc section  through however  gallagher s ability to recoup these investments and generate earnings on them is subject to significant risk and uncertainties relating to  among other things  its utility partners ability to obtain long term permits  the facilities compliance with irc section  possible future changes in regulations  utilities use of coal to produce electricity  the operations of the facilities  gallagher s co investors and operational partners  and intellectual property 
please see the risk factor regarding gallagher s irc section facilities under item a  risk factors  for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties 
during fourth quarter  gallagher recorded pretax charges totaling approximately million as a result of the completion of a previously announced plan to reduce  and the reorganization of  its middle and back office workforce by approximately positions and from the termination of certain office leases 
gallagher currently estimates the future annual pretax cost savings associated with these actions to be approximately million 
anticipated to partially offset these future savings will be increased employee medical costs  salary increases and increased incentive compensation costs totaling million to million  related to the remaining workforce 

table of contents contingent commission matters the insurance industry has  in recent years  been subject to scrutiny by various regulatory bodies with respect to contingent compensation arrangements 
during the period from january through september  gallagher s retail brokerage operations were prohibited from accepting retail contingent commissions under the terms of a settlement agreement with the illinois attorney general and illinois department of insurance 
this agreement was amended in july and pursuant to the amendment  as of october   gallagher is no longer prohibited from accepting retail contingent commissions 
as a result of this amendment  gallagher anticipates that it could generate additional retail contingent commission revenues of up to million on an annualized basis by critical accounting policies gallagher s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
gallagher believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition commission revenues are recognized at the later of the billing or the effective date of the related insurance policies  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
commission revenues related to installment premiums are recognized as the installments are billed 
contingent commissions  supplemental commissions and commissions on premiums directly billed by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the data necessary to reasonably determine such amounts have been obtained by gallagher 
typically  these types of commission revenues cannot be reasonably determined until the cash or the related policy detail is received by gallagher from the insurance carrier 
a contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is based on the overall profit and or volume of the business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular calendar year 
a supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commissions paid  is determined by the insurance carrier and is established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria 
commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers to the insureds generally relate to a large number of p c transactions  each with small premiums  and comprise a substantial portion of the revenues generated by gallagher s employee benefit operations 
under these direct bill arrangements  the billing and policy issuance process is controlled entirely by the insurance carrier 
the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known 
fee revenues generated from the brokerage segment primarily relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions  which are recognized in the same manner as commission revenues 
fee revenues generated from the risk management segment relate to third party claims administration  loss control and other risk management consulting services  which are provided over a period of time  typically one year 
these fee revenues are recognized ratably as the services are rendered 
the income effects of subsequent fee adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known 
premiums and fees receivable in the consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations and doubtful accounts 
the allowance for estimated policy cancellations is established through a charge to revenues  while the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to other operating expenses 
both of these allowances are based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience 
gallagher periodically reviews the adequacy of these allowances and makes adjustments as necessary 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
income taxes gallagher s tax rate reflects its earnings  statutory tax rates and tax planning in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
gallagher reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return as required by gaap 
gallagher evaluates its tax positions using a two step process 
the first step involves recognition 
gallagher determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial authority legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment 
subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition  derecognition and measurement 
adjustments may result  for example  upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities  or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue 
gallagher recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

table of contents tax law requires items be included in gallagher s tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings is different than that reported in the tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the returns  and some differences are temporary and reverse over time  such as depreciation expense and amortization expense deductible for income tax purposes 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which a tax payment has been deferred  or expense which has been deducted in the tax return but has not yet been recognized in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are established or adjusted for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 
in assessing the need for the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  gallagher considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of the deferred tax assets  will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly 
gallagher evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence as part of its analysis 
negative evidence includes the existence of losses in recent years 
positive evidences includes the forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction  tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets and the presence of taxable income in prior carryback years 
the underlying assumptions gallagher uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account gallagher s recent performance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible or creditable 
intangible assets intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of acquired businesses 
gallagher classifies its intangible assets as either goodwill  expiration lists or non compete agreements 
expiration lists and non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives three to fifteen years for expiration lists and three to five years for non compete agreements  while goodwill is not subject to amortization 
allocation of intangible assets between goodwill  expiration lists and non compete agreements and the determination of estimated useful lives are based on valuations gallagher receives from qualified independent appraisers 
the calculations of these amounts are based on estimates and assumptions using historical and pro forma data and recognized valuation methods 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
intangible assets are carried at cost  less accumulated amortization in the consolidated balance sheet 
gallagher reviews all of its intangible assets for impairment periodically at least annually and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such impairment reviews are performed at the division level ie  reporting unit with respect to goodwill and at the business unit level for amortizable intangible assets 
in reviewing intangible assets  if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the respective or underlying asset  an indicator of impairment would exist and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings 
based on the results of impairment reviews in and  gallagher wrote off million and million  respectively  of amortizable intangible assets related to the brokerage segment acquisitions 
the intangible asset write off was reported in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings 
no such indicators were noted in the determinations of impairment indicators and fair value are based on estimates and assumptions related to the amount and timing of future cash flows and future interest rates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised accounting guidance for business combinations 
the primary requirements of the revised guidance are as follows upon initially obtaining control  the acquiring entity in a business combination must recognize of the fair value of the acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired of its target entity 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model has been eliminated 
contingent consideration arrangements ie  potential earnout obligations will be measured at fair value at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration 
the concept of recognizing contingent consideration at a later date  when the amount of that consideration is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt  is no longer applicable 
all transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
effective january   gallagher adopted the revised guidance on a prospective basis to account for its acquisitions  which includes the estimation and recognition of the fair value of liabilities related to potential earnout obligations as of the acquisition dates for all of its acquisitions whose purchase agreements contain such provisions 
subsequent changes in these estimated earnout obligations will be recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings when incurred 
potential earnout obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired entities 
for acquisitions made prior to january   such obligations were not included in the purchase price recorded for each applicable acquisition at its acquisition date because such obligations are not fixed and determinable 
future payments made under these and prior arrangements  if any  will be generally recorded as additional goodwill when the earnouts are settled and will have no impact on the amounts reported in gallagher s consolidated statement of earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on the business combinations 

table of contents historically  gallagher has not incurred a material amount of external transaction costs related to its acquisitions 
however  when it has incurred such costs  gallagher has capitalized these costs as part of its purchase accounting 
effective january   gallagher expenses all external transaction costs related to its acquisitions as incurred 
fair value of investments for investments that do not have quoted market prices  gallagher utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value and proactively looks for indicators of impairment 
factors that may indicate that an impairment could exist include  among others  defaults on interest and or principal payments  reductions or changes to dividend payments  sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  recent refinancings or recapitalizations  unfavorable press reports  untimely filing of financial information  significant customer or revenue loss  litigation  tax audits  losses by other companies in a similar industry  overall economic conditions  management and expert advisor changes and significant changes in strategy 
in addition  in cases where the ultimate value of an investment is directly dependent on gallagher for future financial support  gallagher assesses its willingness and intent to provide future funding 
if an indicator of impairment exists  gallagher compares the investment s carrying value to an estimate of its fair value 
to estimate the fair value of its equity investments  gallagher compares values established in recent recapitalizations or appraisals conducted by third parties 
in some cases  no such recapitalizations or appraisals exist and gallagher must perform its own valuations 
this also requires gallagher to exercise significant judgment 
even if impairment indicators exist  no write down may be required if the estimated fair value is not less than the current carrying value  or the decline in value is determined to be temporary and gallagher has no intent to sell the investment  and it is more likely than not that gallagher will not be required to sell the investment prior to a recovery in value 
when gallagher determines the decline in fair value is other than temporary  and therefore that a write down is required  it is recorded as a realized loss against current period earnings 
both the process to review for indicators of impairment and  if such indicators exist  the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporate quantitative data and qualitative criteria  including the receipt of new information  that can significantly change the decision about the valuation of an investment in a short period of time 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment 
the timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could vary if management s conclusions were different 
due to the inherent risk of investments  gallagher cannot give assurance that there will not be impairments in the future should economic and other conditions change 
business combinations and dispositions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of business combinations and and dispositions  respectively 
results of operations in the discussion that follows regarding gallagher s results of operations  gallagher provides organic growth percentages with respect to its commission and fee revenues 
this information may be considered a non gaap financial measure because it is derived from gallagher s consolidated financial information but is not required to be presented in financial statements that are prepared in conformity with gaap 
rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec require supplemental explanations and reconciliations of all non gaap financial measures 
when gallagher refers to organic growth percentages with respect to its commission and fee revenues in its discussion of results of operations  gallagher excludes the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from the acquisitions accounted for as purchases and the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented 
these commissions and fees are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine the revenue growth that is associated with the operations that were part of gallagher in both the current and prior year 
in addition  organic growth excludes contingent commission revenues and foreign currency translation 
these revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that will be continuing in and beyond 
management has historically utilized organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of its brokerage and risk management segments 
management also believes that the use of this measure allows financial statement users to measure  analyze and compare the growth from its brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner 
a reconciliation of organic revenue growth percentages to the reported revenue growth percentages for the brokerage and risk management segments is presented in the paragraphs immediately following each table in which such percentages are presented 
allocations of investment income and certain expenses are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates primarily using revenue  headcount and other information 
gallagher allocates the provision for income taxes to the brokerage and risk management segments as if those segments were preparing income tax provisions on a separate company basis 
as a result  the provision for income taxes for the financial services and corporate segment reflects the entire benefit to gallagher of the irc section related credits in because that is the segment which produced the credits 
the law that provided for irc section related credits expired on december  gallagher anticipates reporting an effective tax rate of approximately to in both its brokerage segment and its risk management segment for the foreseeable future 
reported operating results by segment would change if different allocation methods were applied 

table of contents in the discussion that follows regarding gallagher s results of operations  gallagher also provides the following ratios with respect to its operating results pretax profit margin  compensation expense ratio and operating expense ratio 
pretax profit margin represents pretax earnings from continuing operations divided by total revenues 
the compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing compensation expense by total revenues 
the operating expense ratio is derived by dividing operating expense by total revenues 
brokerage the brokerage segment accounted for of gallagher s revenue from continuing operations in gallagher s brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale brokerage operations 
gallagher s retail brokerage operations negotiate and place p c  employer provided health and welfare insurance and retirement solutions  principally for middle market commercial  industrial  public entity  religious and not for profit entities 
many of gallagher s retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance with insurance underwriters  while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as self insurance pools  risk retention groups or captive insurance companies 
in addition  gallagher s wholesale brokerage operations assist gallagher brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and agents in the placement of specialized  unique and hard to place insurance programs 
the primary source of gallagher s compensation for its retail brokerage services is commissions paid by insurance companies  which are usually based on a percentage of the premium paid by insureds and or brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by its clients 
for wholesale brokerage services  gallagher generally receives a share of the commission paid to the retail broker from the insurer 
commission rates are dependent on a number of factors  including the type of insurance  the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether gallagher acts as a retail or wholesale broker 
advisory fees are dependent on the extent and value of services provided 
under certain circumstances  gallagher may also receive contingent commissions  which are based on the estimated profit the underwriting insurance company earns and or the overall volume of business placed by gallagher in a given period of time 
financial information relating to gallagher s brokerage segment is as follows in millions  except percentages and workforce data percent change percent change commissions fees investment income and other total revenues compensation operating depreciation amortization change in estimated acquisition earnout payables nmf nmf total expenses earnings from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes earnings from continuing operations growth revenues organic growth decline in commissions and fees compensation expense ratio operating expense ratio pretax profit margin effective tax rate workforce at end of period includes acquisitions identifiable assets at december 
table of contents in fourth quarter  gallagher made a determination to exit its global reinsurance operations and its irish wholesale brokerage operations 
in first quarter  gallagher signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of its reinsurance brokerage business 
under the agreements  gallagher received initial proceeds of million in cash and a million note receivable to be paid by december  which was collected in full prior to december  and potential additional contingent proceeds of up to million that are based on revenues generated in the twelve months subsequent to march in third quarter  gallagher abandoned its efforts to sell its small irish wholesale brokerage operations and ceased those operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of gallagher s discontinued operations

the law that provided for irc section tax credits expired on december  gallagher is an investor in three clean energy ventures chem mod  a multi pollutant reduction venture  possesses rights  information and technologies for the reduction of unwanted emissions created during the combustion of coal 
chem mod has developed and is the exclusive licensee of proprietary emissions technologies it refers to as the chem mod solution  which uses a dual injection sorbent system to reduce mercury  sulfur dioxide and other toxic emissions at coal fired power plants 
although chem mod is in the early stages of commercializing the technologies  the principal potential market for the chem mod solution is coal fired power plants owned by utility companies 
effective august   gallagher has a direct and indirect ownership interest in chem mod and is required to consolidate its operations into gallagher s consolidated financial statements

chem mod continues to market its technologies in an effort to secure more commercial licenses 
while gallagher currently believes that its chem mod interests may prove to have substantial value  there can be no assurance given as to timing or amount  if any  with respect to any realization on this investment 
gallagher believes that the application of the chem mod solution will qualify for refined coal tax credits under irc section gallagher has made and committed to capital expenditures of million as of december   to build eight refined coal facilities that will be used in the operations of utilities

financial condition and liquidity liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations 
the insurance brokerage industry is not capital intensive 
historically  gallagher s capital requirements have primarily included dividend payments on its common stock  repurchases of its common stock  funding of its investments  acquisitions of brokerage and risk management operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities historically  gallagher has depended on its ability to generate positive cash flow from operations to meet its cash requirements 
however  to fund acquisitions made during  gallagher relied to a large extent on proceeds from borrowings under its credit agreement 
management believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement will provide gallagher with adequate resources to meet its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation payments and income tax payments 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to interest paid on the million of notes issued under the note purchase agreement  an increase in incentive compensation payments  an increase in errors and omissions claim payments and a decrease in operating earnings generated from the brokerage and risk management operations 
gallagher s cash flows from operating activities are primarily derived from its earnings from operations  as adjusted for realized gains and losses and its non cash expenses  which include depreciation  amortization  change in estimated acquisition earnout payables  deferred compensation  restricted stock and stock based and other noncash compensation expenses 
when assessing the overall liquidity of gallagher  the focus should be on earnings from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash items  in the consolidated statement of earnings and cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as indicators of trends in liquidity 
from a balance sheet perspective  the focus should not be on premium and fees receivable  premiums payable or restricted cash for trends in liquidity 
because of the variability in the timing of premiums and fees receivable and premiums payable  net cash flows provided by operations may vary substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year related to these items 
in order to consider these items in assessing trends in liquidity for gallagher  they should be looked at in a combined manner  because changes in these balances are interrelated and are based on the timing of premium payments  both to and from gallagher 
in addition  funds legally restricted as to gallagher s use relating to premiums and clients claim funds held as fiduciary funds  are presented in gallagher s consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash and have not been included in determining gallagher s overall liquidity 
gallagher s policy for funding its defined benefit pension plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements under the irc 
there currently is no erisa funding requirement for the plan in or contribution rates are determined by the plan s actuaries based on funding practices and requirements 
funding amounts may be influenced by future asset performance  the level of discount rates and other variables impacting the assets and or liabilities of the plan 
in addition  amounts funded in the future  to the extent not due under regulatory requirements  may be affected by alternative uses of gallagher s cash flows  including dividends  acquisitions and common stock repurchases 
during  gallagher made discretionary contributions of million to the plan 
gallagher is considering making additional discretionary contributions to the plan in and may be required to make contributions to the plan in future periods

the offsetting adjustment to the amount of liabilities required to be recognized is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  in gallagher s consolidated balance sheet 
subsequent changes in the funded status will be recognized through the income statement and other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur as appropriate 
the change in funded status of the plans is impacted by numerous items  including actual results compared with prior estimates and assumptions and changes in assumptions to reflect information available at the respective measurement dates 
in  the funded status of gallagher s plans was significantly impacted by an increase in the discount rates used in the measurement of the pension liabilities at december   reflecting an increase in credit costs on high quality corporate debt obligations  and negative asset returns 
the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a reduction in noncurrent assets of million and an increase in noncurrent liabilities of million  including a related adjustment to tax benefits of million and a reduction of gallagher s stockholders equity of million in in  the funded status of gallagher s plans significantly improved primarily due to favorable asset returns 
the change in funded status of the plans resulted in a decrease in noncurrent liabilities of million  including a related adjustment to tax benefits of million and an increase of gallagher s stockholders equity of million in while the change in funded status of the plans had no impact on gallagher s cash flows from operations in or  changes in the pension regulatory environment and investment losses in its pension plan have an effect on gallagher s capital position and could require gallagher to make significant contributions to its defined benefit pension plan and increase its pension expense in future periods

borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in were fully repaid in third quarter using proceeds from the note purchase agreement 
the remaining net proceeds from the note purchase agreement were principally used for acquisitions and stock repurchases 
the note purchase agreements and the credit agreement contain various covenants that require gallagher to maintain specified levels of net worth and financial leverage ratios 
gallagher was in compliance with these covenants at december  unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets  particularly in the us and europe  have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
these disruptions could make it more difficult for gallagher to obtain financing for its operations or investments or increase its cost of obtaining financing 
although gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility and is not aware of any issues currently impacting the ability or willingness of the lenders under its revolving credit facility to honor their commitment to extend credit  the us and global credit crisis could adversely affect its ability to borrow on its revolving credit facility in the future 
the credit agreement expires on october  gallagher believes that it will not encounter any significant issues with the ability or willingness of the lenders to renew the credit facility 
gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance 
if those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties  gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to gallagher  which could have a significant adverse impact on gallagher s consolidated financial condition and results of operations

table of contents dividends gallagher s dividend policy is determined by the board of directors

the plan authorizes the repurchase of gallagher s common stock at such times and prices as gallagher may deem advantageous  in transactions on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
gallagher is under no commitment or obligation to repurchase any particular amount of common stock  and the share repurchase plan can be suspended at any time at gallagher s discretion 
funding for share repurchases may come from a variety of sources  including cash from operations  short term or long term borrowings under gallagher s credit agreement or other sources 
the common stock repurchases reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows for  and include  shares at a cost of million   shares at a cost of million and  shares at a cost of million  respectively  that were repurchased by gallagher from its employees to cover their income tax withholding obligations in connection with restricted stock distributions in each of those years 
under these circumstances  gallagher withholds the proceeds from the repurchases and remits them to the taxing authorities on the employees behalf to cover their income tax withholding obligations 
another source of liquidity to gallagher is the issuance of its common stock pursuant to its stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from issuance of common stock under these plans were million in  million in  and million in prior to  gallagher issued stock options under four stock option based employee compensation plans

for all periods prior to january   gallagher recognized compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the espp 
effective january   gallagher no longer recognize any compensation expense related to the common stock issued under the espp 
proceeds from the issuance of its common stock related to these plans have contributed favorably to net cash provided by financing activities and gallagher believes this favorable trend will continue in the foreseeable future  but at reduced levels from what occurred historically

in  gallagher expects total expenditures for capital improvements to be approximately million  primarily related to office moves and expansions and updating computer systems and equipment

table of contents gallagher s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth in revenues and earnings in its brokerage segment 
while gallagher intends to continue to seek to complete acquisitions  its ability to do so using cash may be inhibited in light of current conditions in the economy and financial markets  and there can be no assurance that gallagher s level of acquisition activity and growth from acquisitions will be consistent with past levels 
for a further discussion of risks associated with gallagher s acquisition activity  see item a  risk factors 
dispositions during  gallagher signed definitive agreements to sell substantially all of its reinsurance brokerage business 
under the agreements  gallagher received initial proceeds of million and potential additional proceeds of up to million that are based on revenues relating to risks attaching on reinsurance agreements placed in the twelve month period after the closing dates of the respective agreements  with the express intention that gallagher be credited with eighteen months of revenues in respect of any risk attaching in such twelve month period 
these contingent proceeds can be adjusted for any changes ie  premium audits made to the underlying revenues during the thirty month periods subsequent to the anniversary dates of the respective agreements 
in january  gallagher signed and closed a definitive agreement to sell all of the remaining run off obligations of its us reinsurance brokerage business 
under the agreement  gallagher transferred restricted cash of million  receivables of million and liabilities of million to the buyer 
during  and  gallagher sold several small books of business and recognized one time gains of million  million and million  respectively  which approximated the cash proceeds received related to these transactions 
outlook gallagher believes it has sufficient capital to meet its short and long term cash flow needs 
except for and  gallagher s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have increased year over year since in  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges related to real estate lease terminations  severance  litigation  impairments of intangible assets and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation 
in  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were adversely impacted by charges incurred for litigation and retail contingent commission related matters and claims handling obligations 
gallagher expects the historically favorable trend in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes to continue in the foreseeable future because it intends to continue to expand its business through organic growth from existing operations and growth through acquisitions 
additionally  gallagher anticipates that it will continue to use cash flows from operations and  if needed  borrowings under the credit agreement and its common stock to fund acquisitions 
in addition  gallagher may from time to time consider other alternatives for longer term funding sources 
such alternatives could include raising additional capital through public or private debt markets  equity markets  or restructuring its operations in the event that cash flows from operations are reduced dramatically due to lost business 
contractual obligations and commitments in connection with its investing and operating activities  gallagher has entered into certain contractual obligations and commitments 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these obligations and commitments 
gallagher s future minimum cash payments  excluding interest  associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its note purchase agreements and credit agreement  operating leases and purchase commitments at december  were as follows in millions payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total note purchase agreements credit agreement total debt obligations operating lease obligations less sublease arrangements outstanding purchase obligations total contractual obligations the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect gallagher s actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with gallagher s unrecognized tax benefits at december   gallagher is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period in which cash settlements may be made with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

the effect of actual changes in these market risk factors may differ materially from gallagher s estimates 
in the ordinary course of business  gallagher also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or unquantifiable  including credit risk and legal risk 
these risks are not included in the following analyses 
gallagher s invested assets are primarily held as cash and cash equivalents  which are subject to various market risk exposures such as interest rate risk 
the fair value of gallagher s cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio at december  approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates for the instruments contained in the cash and cash equivalents investment portfolio 
the resulting fair values were not materially different from the carrying values at december  gallagher has other investments that have valuations that are indirectly influenced by equity market and general economic conditions  which can change rapidly 
in addition  some investments require direct and active financial and operational support from gallagher 
a future material adverse effect may result from changes in market conditions or if gallagher elects to withdraw financial or operational support 
at december   gallagher had million of borrowings outstanding under its note purchase agreements 
the aggregate fair value of these borrowings at december  was million due to their long term duration and fixed interest rates associated with these debt obligations 
there is no active or observable market for gallagher s private placement long term debt 
therefore  the estimated fair value of this debt is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates available for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
to estimate an all in interest rate for discounting  market quotes were obtained for notes with the same terms as gallagher s 
there is no rate adjustment for the risk profile changes  covenant issues or credit rating changes at gallagher  and therefore the market quotes are deemed to be the closest approximation of current market rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in gallagher s weighted average borrowing rate at december  and the resulting fair values would be million higher than their carrying value 
at december   gallagher had no borrowings outstanding under its credit agreement 
however  in the event that gallagher does have borrowings outstanding  the fair value of these borrowings approximate their carrying value due to their short term duration and variable interest rates 
market risk would be estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in gallagher s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december  and the resulting fair values would not be materially different from their carrying value 
gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from its uk based subsidiaries that incur expenses denominated primarily in british pounds while receiving a substantial portion of their revenues in us dollars 
in addition  gallagher is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk from its australian and canadian operations due to transacting business in their local denominated currencies 
foreign currency gains losses related to this market risk are recorded in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes as they are incurred 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a weakening of the us dollar  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would decrease by approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical favorable change of in the average foreign currency exchange rate for a strengthening of the us dollar  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes would increase by approximately million 
gallagher is also subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated

however  it is management s opinion that this foreign currency exchange risk is not material to gallagher s consolidated operating results or financial position 
gallagher manages the balance sheets of its foreign subsidiaries  where practical  such that foreign liabilities are matched with equal foreign assets  thereby maintaining a balanced book which minimizes the effects of currency fluctuations 
historically  gallagher has rarely entered into derivatives or other similar financial instruments for hedging  trading or speculative purposes 
however  with respect to managing foreign currency exchange rate risk in the uk  gallagher has periodically purchased financial instruments when market opportunities arose to minimize its exposure to this risk 
the impact of this hedging strategy was not material to gallagher s consolidated financial statements for  and
