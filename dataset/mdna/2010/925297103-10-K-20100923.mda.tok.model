item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial trends during fiscal year  versar s business segments  other than the compliance and environmental business segment  experienced increases in gross revenues and gross profit because of continued government emphasis on funding of a number of international programs within the company s core businesses 
during this period  versar continued to benefit from work for the air force in iraq  although it began to experience a decline in new work in iraq during the second half of fiscal year as anticipated  reconstruction efforts in iraq were significantly reduced during fiscal year  because of the reduced air force role there resulting in significant declines in gross revenue and gross profit in the company s program management business segment 
since fiscal year  reconstruction work in iraq has declined from of the company s business volume to of volume during fiscal year to offset in part the loss of revenues from iraq  the company has continued to follow funding shifts to afghanistan  attempting to maintain and expand its business there and has pursued acquisitions and other business opportunities to expand its core business base 
while these efforts have led to the company securing a contract to provide electricians in iraq for the us army under which it anticipates approximately million of revenue in fiscal year and additional work in afghanistan which it believes will result in increased revenue of approximately million in fiscal year  the company must continue to expand these efforts to fully replace the loss of revenues from iraq 
the company s compliance and environmental business segment has been most significantly impacted by the declining us economy over the last two years 
management expects to continue to face challenges in fiscal year in the compliance and environmental business segment as municipalities continue to face funding shortfalls due to current economic conditions 
therefore  the company continues to take steps to further diversify its business to replace reduced or eliminated opportunities in iraq  as discussed above  and reduced municipality work in its compliance and environmental business segment 
the company has also taken staff reduction efforts and closed two offices to align costs with the current business realities 
the company continues to focus on us based brac efforts  funding for which had been delayed as a result of the war in iraq as well as the expanded us efforts in afghanistan 
funding for brac work began to increase in fiscal year and we expect that funding of brac work worldwide will continue to increase during fiscal year versar is also focused on new initiatives in the rural broadband market in the us  and on green energy development projects and programs providing engineering  design and construction support  and on further expanding the professional services and national security business segments to address cost constraints while effectively providing business solutions to meet our clients changing needs 
the company s business is now operated through four segments as follows program management  compliance and environmental programs  professional services  and national security 
program management continues to be the largest business segment of the company 
these segments were segregated based on the nature of the work  business processes  customer base and the business environment in which each of the segments operates 
there are a number of risk factors or uncertainties that could significantly impact our future financial performance  including the following general economic or political conditions  threatened or pending litigation  the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives  employee hiring  utilization  and turnover rates  the seasonality of spending in the federal government and for commercial clients  delays in project contracted engagements  unanticipated contract changes impacting profitability  reductions in prices by our competitors  the ability to obtain follow on work  failure to properly manage projects resulting in additional costs  the cost of compliance for the company s laboratories  the results of a negative government audit potentially impacting our costs  reputation and ability to work with the federal government

the decrease in working capital and in tangible net worth is directly attributable to the acquisition of pps in january and advent environmental in march of this fiscal year and the operating losses experienced this year 
in march  the company modified its line of credit facility with united bank to increase its aggregate borrowing capacity from million to million in anticipation of higher working capital requirements with the new acquisitions 
the modification also reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement and revised certain letter of credit and fee provisions of the credit facility 
the line of credit is subject to certain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios 
as modified  these covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of million  a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and a minimum current ratio of at least to interest accrues on borrowings under the line of credit at the prime rate of interest less with a floor interest rate of 
borrowing rates at fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
failure to meet the covenant requirements gives the bank the right to demand outstanding amounts due under the line of credit  which may impact the company s ability to finance its working capital requirements 
as of june   the company had no outstanding borrowings and was in compliance with the financial covenants 
the company has a letter of credit of approximately  outstanding under the line of credit facility which serves as collateral for surety bond coverage provided by the company s insurance carrier against project construction work

information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or incurred costs reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
the company records income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
revisions to such estimates are made when they become known 
detailed quarterly project reviews are conducted with project managers to review all project progress accruals and revenue recognition 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of the company s business on projects where the company is contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability and collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
all receivables over days old are reviewed as part of this process 
net deferred tax asset the company has approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of june  as a result of the net loss incurred in fiscal year  the company has established deferred tax assets to utilize the net operating loss to carry back or carry forward in amended or future tax returns 
the company anticipates that future profitable operating years will enable the company to fully utilize those assets long lived assets the company is required to review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
we review the cash flows of the operating units to ensure the carrying values do not exceed the cash flows that they support 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions 
the company believes its long lived assets as of june  are fully realizable 
asset retirement obligation the company has recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the estimated clean up costs for its chemical laboratory in its national security business segment

the company is pursuing reimbursement for such costs and other costs from the us army as a significant portion of the chemical agent that was used in the chemical laboratory was government owned 
if the company determines that the estimated clean up cost is larger than expected or the likelihood of recovery from the us army is remote  such adjustments will be reflected when they become known 
at june   the company has accrued approximately a  long term liability to clean up the chemical laboratory 
goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill prior to the acquisitions is approximately  relates to the acquisition of versar global solutions  inc  purchased in fiscal year and is now part of the program management business segment 
in performing its goodwill impairment analysis  management has utilized a market based valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the program management business segment 
management engages outside professionals and valuation experts annually  as necessary  to assist in performing this analysis and would test more often if events and circumstances warranted it 
an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of the program management business segment exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of million on an enterprise value basis by a substantial margin 
should the program management business segment s financial performance not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact the company s cash flow or financial debt covenants
