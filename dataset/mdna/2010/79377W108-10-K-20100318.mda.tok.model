the maximum contingent payment had the agreement been terminated early at january  would have been approximately million 
management believes the risk of incurring a contingent payment is remote 
the company and hsbc have entered into several amendments to the program agreement since in october  the company and hsbc entered into a fifth amendment to the program agreement in response to macroeconomic conditions and portfolio performance  which provides for certain changes to the allocation of risk and revenue sharing between the parties 
the fifth amendment  which became effective february   provides for hsbc to share with the company certain credit losses of the card portfolio and also provides increased revenue sharing to the company 
a net reduction in proprietary credit card income of approximately million to million is estimated for primarily due to this amendment 
in september  the company entered into agreements with hsbc and mastercard international incorporated to issue a co branded mastercard card to new and existing proprietary credit card customers 
under this program  qualifying customers are issued a sfa and mastercard branded credit card that functions as a traditional proprietary credit card when used at any sfa or off th store and at saks direct or as a mastercard card when used at any unaffiliated location that accepts mastercard cards 
hsbc establishes and owns the co brand accounts  retains the benefits and sales associated with the ownership of the accounts  receives the finance charge and other income from the accounts  and incurs the bad debts associated with the accounts 

table of contents capital needs the company estimates capital expenditures for will be approximately million  net of any proceeds including tenant allowances  primarily for store renovations  enhancements to management information systems  maintenance capital and replacement capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that working capital requirements related to existing stores  store renovations and capital expenditures will be funded through cash on hand  cash provided by operations and the revolving credit facility 
maximum availability under the revolving credit facility is million  and there is no debt rating trigger 
during periods in which availability under the facility exceeds million  the company is not subject to financial covenants 
if availability under the facility were to decrease to less than million  the company would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to during  weighted average letters of credit issued under this credit facility were million and letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow 
the company expects that its cash flows from operating activities combined with borrowings under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to sustain its current level of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion sets forth the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition sales and the related gross margin are recorded at the time customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take ownership of the merchandise 
revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption of the card 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund based on historical trends and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns occur within a short time after the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail method 
on february   the company elected to change its method of costing its inventories to the retail first in  first out fifo method  whereas in all prior periods inventory was costed using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
the new method of accounting had no impact on the fiscal years ending january   january   and february  as the lifo value exceeded the fifo market value and inventory had been adjusted to reflect fifo market value in all periods 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the 
table of contents perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail prices for merchandise held for sale too high  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or overly conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
the company regularly records a provision for estimated shrinkage  thereby reducing the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
a complete physical inventory of all the company s stores and distribution facilities is performed annually  with the recorded amount of merchandise inventory being adjusted to coincide with this physical count 
the differences between the estimated amount of shrinkage and the actual amount realized have been insignificant 
the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when the vendor provides support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction to cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction in cost purchases 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from its estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 
depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over forty percent of the company s assets at january  are represented by investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
the company principally utilizes the straight line depreciation method and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets is considered 
when constructing stores  the company receives allowances from landlords 
if the landlord is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the property  then the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered to be a deferred rent liability  whereas the corresponding capital expenditures related to that store are considered to be prepaid rent 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of 
table of contents the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing and  absent certain triggering events  annually during the fourth quarter 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates  inflation and store expenses 
during the year ended january   january   and february   the company incurred impairment charges of million  million  and million  respectively  related to asset impairments and other costs in the normal course of business 
leases the company leases stores  distribution centers  and administrative facilities under operating leases 
store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
most of the company s lease agreements include renewal periods at the company s option 
the company recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the company takes possession of the leased space 
rent expense incurred prior to the opening of a store is charged to store pre opening costs 
the company records tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company records rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s net deferred tax assets of million at january  consist of federal and state nol carryforwards that will expire between and the majority of the nol carryforward is a result of the net operating losses incurred during the fiscal years ended january  and january  due principally to difficult market and macroeconomic conditions 
we have concluded  based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence that all but million of these tax benefits relating to certain state losses are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
therefore  a valuation allowance for the million has been established 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
in  this evaluation resulted in an additional reserve against state deferred tax assets of million  impacting our results of operations 
a similar analysis was performed in  which resulted in an additional reserve against state deferred tax assets of million 
while the company has incurred a cumulative loss over the three year period ended january   after evaluating all available evidence including our past operating results  the macroeconomic factors contributing to the recent fiscal loss  the length of the carryforward periods available and our forecast of future taxable income  including the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  we concluded that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset  net of the million 
table of contents valuation allowance related to state nols  will be realized 
we will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowance in the future 
if future results are less than projected or tax planning alternatives are no longer viable  then additional valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state and local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
taxing authorities may question the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
additional reserves of million  million and million were established for issues raised in current state tax examinations and previously filed federal tax returns related to prior periods during  and  respectively 
at january   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for future exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
the company adopted the provisions of new accounting guidance related to uncertain income tax positions effective as of the beginning of fiscal year as a result of the implementation of this accounting guidance  the company recorded a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to the beginning shareholder s equity 
the company had approximately million and million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at january  and january   respectively 
as of january   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective income tax rate in any future periods 
the company continually evaluates its tax filing positions and to the extent the company prevails on audits or statutes of limitation expire  the unrecognized tax benefits could be realized 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that up to million in unrecognized tax benefits relating to prior acquisitions could be recognized within months of the january  balance sheet date 
as a result of the analysis of uncertain tax positions upon the adoption of the relevant accounting guidance in the net deferred tax asset related to state nol carryforwards increased 
therefore  the company performed a valuation allowance analysis to determine the realizability of this asset 
this analysis resulted in an additional valuation allowance of million with the offset recorded to shareholders equity in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
the company was subject to the provisions of this accounting guidance for these net operating losses since these losses were acquired through the acquisition of a company that had previously filed bankruptcy 
the company files a consolidated us federal income tax return as well as state tax returns in multiple state jurisdictions 
the company has completed examinations by the internal revenue service or the statute of limitations has expired for taxable years through january  with no significant adjustments 
with respect to the state and local jurisdictions  the company has completed examinations in many jurisdictions through the same period and beyond and currently has examinations in progress for several jurisdictions 
pension plans the company sponsors a defined benefit cash balance pension plan and serp for certain employees of the company 
the company amended the pension plan during  freezing benefit accruals for all participants except those who have attained age and completed years of credited service as of january   who are 
table of contents considered to be non highly compensated employees 
in january  the company suspended future benefit accruals for all remaining participants in the plan effective on march  this curtailment resulted in a gain of approximately million for the year ended january  pension expense is based on actuarial models used to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to participants and is allocated to the respective service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
the company s funding policy provides that contributions to the pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of the company may provide additional contributions from time to time  generally not to exceed the maximum tax deductible limitation 
the pension plans are valued annually as of the company s fiscal year end balance sheet date 
the projected unit credit method is utilized in recognizing the pension liabilities 
in september  the fasb issued a new accounting pronouncement which requires employers to i recognize the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet  ii recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost and iii measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s statement of financial position 
the company adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of the new pronouncement prospectively on february  effective january   in accordance with the new pronouncement  the company changed its measurement date from november to the date of its fiscal year end 
the company elected to adopt the change in measurement date using the alternative transition method 
in accordance with the alternative transition method  the actuarial valuation provided a month projection of net periodic benefit cost to january  that resulted in a million decrease to ending retained earnings 
pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates as of the annual measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based upon pension discount curves and bond portfolio curves over a duration similar to the plan s liabilities as of the measurement date 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the company s pension obligation  which is represented by the accumulated benefit obligation abo and the projected benefit obligation pbo and in calculating net pension expense 
at january   the discount rate used to calculate the abo and pbo was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s pbo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is approximately million on the pbo and approximately million on annual pension expense 
to the extent the pbo increases  the after tax effect of such increase serves to reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the pbo 
it is the company s policy to invest approximately of the pension fund assets in equities  in fixed income securities and in real estate 
the company s estimate of the expected long term rate of return considers the historical returns on plan assets  as well as the future expectations of returns on classes of assets within the target asset allocation of the plan asset portfolio 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately years 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is likewise not affected 
rather  this loss increases pension expense over approximately years 
the company s expected long term rate of return on assets was in and 
table of contents the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
due to the curtailment of the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase will no longer be utilized in determining the pbo and pension expense
