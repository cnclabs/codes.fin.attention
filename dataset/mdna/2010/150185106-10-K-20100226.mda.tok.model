item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
in order to efficiently manage our properties  we created regional designations for our parks 
the northern region  which is the largest  includes cedar point and the adjacent soak city water park  kings island  canada s wonderland  dorney park  valleyfair  geauga lake and michigan s adventure 
the southern region includes kings dominion  carowinds  worlds of fun and oceans of fun 
finally  our western region includes knott s berry farm  great america and the soak city water parks located in palm springs  san diego and adjacent to knott s berry farm 
this region also includes the management contract with gilroy gardens family theme park in gilroy  california and star trek the experience star trek  an interactive adventure in las vegas  which closed to the public on september  after management concluded it would not renew a contract scheduled to expire on december  the results of operations of star trek are not material to the consolidated financial statements

for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most comparable financial measure  see note in item  selected financial data  on page critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level park level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
long lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived trade names are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill and trade names have been assigned at the reporting unit  or park level  for purposes of impairment testing 
goodwill related to parks acquired prior to is annually tested for impairment as of october st 
we completed this review during the fourth quarter in and determined the goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill and trade names related to the paramount parks ppi acquisition in is annually tested for impairment as of april st 
we completed this review during the second quarter in and determined that such goodwill and trade names were not impaired 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in equity price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  which is estimated using both an income discounted cash flow and market approach 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these approaches 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
at the end of the fourth quarter  we concluded that based on operating results and forecasted results  that a review of our trade names was warranted 
after performing this review  we determined that a portion of our trade names  originally recorded with the ppi acquisition  were impaired 
as a result  we recognized million of trade name impairment as of december  it is possible that our assumptions about future performance  as well as the economic outlook  and related conclusions regarding the valuation of our reporting units parks  could change adversely  which may result in 
table of contents additional impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations  in future periods 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable 
reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third party estimates of settlement costs 
reserves for ibnr claims  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements  are based upon our own claims data history  as well as industry averages 
all reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the use of derivative financial instruments is accounted for according to financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification s asc derivatives and hedging 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities under fasb asc are reported as net change in fair value of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net change in fair value of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted periodically during the season 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina dockage revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 

table of contents results of operations vs 
the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and increase decrease amounts in thousands except per capita spending attendance per capita spending out of park revenues net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization equity based compensation loss on impairment of goodwill and other intangibles loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets gain on sale of other assets   n m operating income n m not meaningful consolidated net revenues totaled million in  decreasing million  from million in the decrease in revenues reflects a  or million visit  decrease in attendance compared with the same period a year ago 
the decrease in attendance was primarily the result of a sharp decline in group sales business  which was negatively affected by the poor economy  a decrease in season pass visits due to a decline in season pass sales during the year and poor weather  including particularly cooler than normal temperatures throughout much of the season at our northern and southern regions 
the revenue decline also represents a decrease of  or  in average in park per capita spending for the year 
in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
excluding the effects of star trek  the decrease in per capita spending for the period would have been  or less than when compared with the same period in out of park revenues  which represent the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates  decreased  or million between years  due primarily to declines in occupancy rates at most of our hotel properties 
operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  decreased  or million  to million from million a year ago 
the decrease in operating costs is the result of the successful implementation of numerous cost savings initiatives  a reduction in variable costs due to a decrease in attendance  and the closing of star trek in late together  these items reduced core operating costs by approximately million  or  in this reduction in operating costs was offset somewhat by million of charges during the year related to the proposed merger and litigation settlements discussed below 
in late august  we completed the sale of acres of surplus land at canada s wonderland to the vaughan health campus of care in ontario  canada as part of our ongoing efforts to reduce debt 
net proceeds from this sale totaled million and resulted in the recognition of a million gain during the period 
after the gain on the sale of the canadian land  depreciation  amortization  loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets  and all other non cash costs  operating profit for the period increased million to million in compared with million in the increase in operating profit was affected by the recording of non cash charges in of million for the impairment of trade names that were originally recorded when we acquired the ppi parks in  compared with non cash charges of million and million recorded in for impairment of 
table of contents goodwill and trade names  respectively 
although the ppi acquisition continues to meet our collective operating and profitability goals  the performance of certain acquired parks has fallen below our original expectations  which when coupled with a higher cost of capital  resulted in these impairment charges 
it is important to note that each of the acquired parks remains profitable  and that the goodwill and trade name write downs do not affect cash  ebitda or liquidity 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these impairment charges 
in  depreciation and amortization increased million from this increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of million  offset by a decrease in depreciation of million 
the increase in amortization expense reflects the accelerated amortization of the intangible asset related to the nickelodeon licensing agreement 
during the year  management determined it would not be renewing the licensing agreement  which expired on december   thus triggering the accelerated amortization in interest expense for decreased million to million from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates on the company s variable rate outstanding borrowings along with lower average debt balances  offset slightly by a basis point increase in interest costs on million of term debt borrowings that were extended by two years in august 
during  we retired million of term debt through regularly scheduled debt amortization payments  as well as the use of available cash from the reduction in our annual distribution rate  the net proceeds from the sale of excess land at canada s wonderland  and the draw of million on our revolving credit facility 
net change in fair value of swaps and other income expense  net  increased million compared with this increase was primarily a result of recording a million non cash charge to income for the change in the mark to market valuations of the company s swaps that had gone ineffective or were de designated for hedge accounting during the year  as well as the related amortization of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive loss 
in the prior year  the swaps were highly effective and the change in the mark to market valuations were appropriately recorded in other comprehensive loss 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded in  consisting of a provision to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million 
this compares with a benefit for taxes of million in  consisting of a benefit to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
a meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and other non cash charges and credits for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation to net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on page 
in  adjusted ebitda decreased million  or  to million  with our adjusted ebitda margin decreasing basis points bps to from in the decrease in margin in was due to decrease in net revenues  caused primarily by a decrease in group business  only being partially offset by cost control initiatives implemented in included in the adjusted ebitda of million is approximately million of costs related to the proposed merger with apollo 
in addition  the results reflect a million settlement of a california class action lawsuit and a million settlement of a licensing dispute with paramount pictures 
excluding these charges  our adjusted ebitda for would have totaled million  down from  and our adjusted ebitda margin would have been  down bps from a year ago

the increase in net revenues reflects a  or  visit  increase in combined attendance  partially offset by a slight decrease in out of park revenues  including our resort hotels  and a decrease in average in park guest per capita spending 
in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
the decrease in average in park guest per capita spending was primarily due to a fundamental shift in the attendance mix in our southern region 
during the operating season  we experienced an increase in attendance in the southern region primarily due to a shift toward season pass admissions  which have historically had a lower per capita spending level associated with them 
offsetting some of the decrease in per capita spending in the southern region was an increase in per capita spending in our western region  while our northern region per capita spending was flat compared to attendance in our northern region increased primarily due to canada s wonderland  which introduced a record breaking ride in  as well as cedar point  kings island and michigan s adventure all experiencing attendance growth in these gains were partially offset by lost amusement park attendance resulting from the geauga lake restructuring 
our western region experienced a decrease in attendance of slightly more than during  due to softness throughout the second half of in that region 
out of park revenues  which represent the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complimentary activities located outside of the park gates  decreased less than  or  operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  decreased  or million  to million from million a year ago 
this decrease was in large part due to lower costs resulting from the restructuring of geauga lake and the closure of star trek on september   as well as a continued focus on controlling cash operating costs during the season 
during  we recognized losses of million on non cash impairment charges at geauga lake  million on the retirement of fixed assets across all properties  and million on the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
this compares to non cash impairment charges at geauga lake of million during the non cash impairment charges at geauga lake were due to a decision made in to operate geauga lake exclusively as a water park beginning in we are currently marketing excess real property at geauga lake 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded non cash charges of million and million for impairment of goodwill and trade names  respectively  that were originally recorded when we acquired the parks in

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these impairment charges 
in  depreciation and amortization decreased million from  due primarily to lower depreciation at geauga lake resulting from the restructuring of that park after the season 
after lower depreciation and amortization  the non cash impairment charges and the retirement of fixed assets  operating income for was million compared with million in  representing a decrease 
in  interest expense and other expense  net  decreased million to million from million in the decrease is due to a combination of lower interest rates on our variable rate debt  the new interest rate swaps that were entered into during the first quarter of  and a lower average balance on our revolving credit facilities during compared to a benefit for taxes of million was recorded in  consisting of a benefit to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million 
this compares with a total provision for taxes of million for  comprised of a million provision on our corporate subsidiaries and an million provision for ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with a net loss of million  or per unit  a year ago 
in  adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to million  while our adjusted ebitda margin improved basis points bps to from in the increase in margin in was due to increased attendance  strong operating results during the peak summer months of july and august  primarily in our northern region  and continued cost controls 
financial condition with respect to both liquidity and cash flow  we ended in sound condition 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in decreased million to million compared with million in the decrease in operating cash flows between years is primarily attributable to the decrease in operating results of our parks  being offset by lower interest and income tax payments  and a favorable change in working capital 
net cash from operating activities in increased million to million compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows between years is primarily attributable to the improved operating results of our parks  lower interest and income tax payments  and a favorable change in working capital 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our parks and resort properties 
during  cash used for investing activities totaled million  compared to million in and million in the change between years is primarily due to the influx of cash from the sale of excess land at canada s wonderland in august of for million 
reflected in the total is million received from cbs corporation as final settlement of a purchase price working capital adjustment related to the acquisition of ppi 

table of contents historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations 
for the operating season  we are investing approximately million in capital improvements at our properties  with the highlight of the program being the addition of two signature roller coasters  one at carowinds and the other at kings dominion 
these two roller coasters will be themed around dale earnhardt  the intimidator and late nascar driver  and will be similar to both behemoth at canada s wonderland and diamondback at kings island  both of which proved to be very successful in the past two seasons 
the program will also include the addition of a family orientated flume ride at cedar point 
in addition to great new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including the re theming of children s areas at five of our parks to the peanuts characters and the addition of a night time light show and display at three of our parks similar to a show introduced at cedar point in which proved very popular with guests 
financing activities net cash utilized for financing activities totaled million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in reflects the retirement of million of term debt with funds obtained from the sale of excess land near canada s wonderland 
during  we were able to retire in total approximately million of term debt 
liquidity and capital resources in june  and as amended in august  in connection with the acquisition of the paramount parks  we entered into a new  million credit agreement with several banks and certain lenders party thereto the credit agreement 
in february  we took advantage of favorable market conditions and amended the credit agreement amended agreement  reducing interest rate spreads on the term borrowings by basis points bps 
in august  the partnership further amended its credit agreement amended agreement  extending million of term debt by two years  while increasing interest rate spreads on those term borrowings by bps 
the extended term debt will mature in and bears interest at a rate of libor plus bps  as long as the partnership s corporate rating from moody s is better than b or its issuer credit rating from s p is better than b 
the amended agreement also allows  among other things  the incurrence of secured debt in the form of loans or bonds  with proceeds to repay existing term loans  up to million of sales leasebacks  with of net proceeds used to repay existing term loans ahead of extended term loans  asset sales in aggregate of greater than million in fair market value  with of net proceeds used to repay existing term loans ahead of extended term loans  and includes a revolving credit facility commitment reduction equal to of the net proceeds upon such sale  and additional offerings of credit extensions 
other terms of the amendment included a reduction in the partnership s existing million revolving credit facilities  including a million reduction in its us facility and a million reduction in its canadian facility 
the credit facilities provided under the amended agreement include million in us revolving loan commitments and million in canadian revolving loan commitments 
under the amended agreement  us denominated loans made under the us and canadian revolving loan commitments that mature on august  currently bear interest at a rate based on libor plus bps 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian revolving commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on bankers acceptance plus bps or canadian prime plus bps 
term debt maturing in currently bears interest at either a rate based on libor plus bps or a rate based on a prime rate plus bps 
the us term loan matures on august  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the canadian term loan matures on february  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
us denominated term loans that mature in currently bear interest at a rate based on libor plus bps 
the credit agreement also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 

table of contents at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt and million in borrowings under the revolving credit facilities 
after letters of credit  which totaled million at december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving credit agreements 
in  we entered into five fixed rate interest rate swap agreements totaling billion 
the weighted average fixed rate on the interest rate swaps is 
the interest rate swaps are set to mature in october based upon our scheduled quarterly regression analysis testing of the effectiveness for the accounting treatment of these swaps  as well as changes in the forward interest rate yield curves used in that testing  the swaps were deemed to be ineffective as of october this resulted in the swaps not qualifying for hedge accounting during the fourth quarter 
during we also entered into two cross currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency risk exposure on term debt borrowings related to our wholly owned canadian subsidiary 
in february  we terminated the two cross currency swaps and received million in cash upon termination 
we replaced these swaps with two new cross currency swap agreements  which effectively converted million of term debt  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 
as a result of paying down the underlying canadian term debt with net proceeds from the sale of surplus land near canada s wonderland in august  the notional amounts of the underlying debt and the cross currency swaps no longer match 
because of the mismatch of the notional amounts  we determined the swaps will no longer be highly effective going forward  resulting in the de designation of the swaps as of the end of august of our total term debt  million is scheduled to mature in based on interest rates in effect at year end for variable rate debt  we expect our aggregate average cost of debt to approximate in and cash interest payments would approximate million in versus actual cash interest paid of million in the amended agreement includes customary covenants to monitor operating performance  as well as liquidity ratios that govern our partnership distributions 
the most restrictive of these ratios is the maximum consolidated leverage ratio which applies only to the ability to declare and pay distributions 
at december   this ratio set forth in the amended agreement decreased to x debt to ebitda 
based on our results  we do not meet this covenant and distributions were suspended as of december  the amended agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios  which if breached for any reason  including a decline in operating results due to economic conditions  could result in an event of default under the agreement 
the most critical of these ratios is the consolidated leverage ratio 
in order to comply with and provide cushion relative to this ratio  which stepped down to x consolidated total debt excluding revolving debt to ebitda at december   we drew million on our revolving credit facility to prepay term debt during the fourth quarter 
this  along with other actions such as the prepayment of term debt with net proceeds from the canadian land sale in august  provided important flexibility and adequate cushion under the covenants of our credit agreement during the second half of the year 
at year end  our consolidated total debt excluding revolving debt to ebitda ratio was x  providing a million ebitda cushion  and was in compliance with the consolidate leverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all other terms of the credit agreement as of year end 
primarily due to the seasonal nature of our business  we again anticipate drawing on the revolver and prepaying term debt during the first quarter of this will allow us to comply with and maintain an adequate level of cushion relative to the consolidated leverage ratio up to the start of our parks operating seasons  at which time we will utilize operating cash flows to pay down our revolving credit facility as usual 
to the extent that our attendance levels are negatively impacted by deteriorating economic and market conditions  and our operating results fall below levels  our ability to satisfy the consolidated leverage ratio  which steps down to x consolidated total debt excluding revolving debt to ebitda at december   could be difficult 
on december   we filed a shelf registration on form s with the sec which  when declared effective by the sec  allows us to offer up to million in debt and or equity securities 
the proposed merger agreement with apollo includes limitations on financing activities until the transaction is completed or terminated 
this restricts our ability to utilize the shelf registration and issue debt or equity securities as a means of addressing capital structure and refinancing issues 

table of contents credit facilities and cash flows from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet working capital needs  debt service and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain obligations on an undiscounted basis at december  in millions payments due by period total thereafter long term debt capital expenditures lease other obligations total represents maturities on long term debt obligations  plus contractual interest payments on all debt

obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  represents contractual lease and purchase obligations in place at year end 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in canada and  from time to time  on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of interest rate swaps  which fix a portion of our variable rate long term debt  and variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit loans 
we mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure from the canadian dollar through the use of foreign currency denominated debt 
hedging of the us dollar denominated debt  used to fund a substantial portion of our net investment in our canadian operations  is accomplished through the use of cross currency swaps 
any gain or loss on the effective hedging instrument primarily offsets the gain or loss on the underlying debt 
translation exposures with regard to our canadian operations are not hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under fasb asc  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities under fasb asc are reported as net change in fair value of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net change in fair value of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements  at december    million of our outstanding long term debt represented fixed rate debt and million represented variable rate debt 
assuming 
table of contents an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings  the cash flow impact of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt  after the rate swap agreements  would be approximately million as of december  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a million decrease in annual operating income 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes  and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates which are consistent with federal and state minimum wage laws 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
