item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview general our primary business is to provide bankcard payment processing services to merchants in the united states and canada 
this involves facilitating the exchange of information and funds between merchants and cardholders financial institutions  providing end to end electronic payment processing services to merchants  including merchant set up and training  transaction authorization and electronic draft capture  clearing and settlement  merchant accounting  merchant assistance and support and risk management 
our merchant customers primarily fall into two categories  our core sme merchants and large national merchants  primarily in the petroleum industry 
we also provide additional services to our merchants  such as payroll processing  gift and loyalty programs  and paper check processing  and we sell and rent point of sale devices and supplies 
on january   we publicly announced the processing system intrusion  which apparently occurred during some portion of see processing system intrusion for more detail 
at december   we provided our bankcard payment processing services to approximately  active sme bankcard merchants located across the united states 
this represents a increase over the  active sme bankcard merchants at december  at december   we provided bankcard payment processing services to approximately large national merchants with approximately  locations 
our total bankcard processing volume for the year ended december  was billion  a increase from the billion processed during the year ended december  bankcard processing volume for includes billion for large national merchants acquired with network services 
for the years ended december  and  our bankcard processing volume was billion and billion  respectively 
in may  we acquired the net assets of the network services business unit network services of alliance data network services llc alliance  for a cash payment of million 
the acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and our credit facilities 
network services provides processing of credit and debit cards to large national merchants  primarily in the petroleum industry 
network services settled million transactions representing over billion of total annual visa and mastercard bankcard processing volume in and in added billion to our bankcard processing volume on million settled transactions since its acquisition in may in addition to settling visa and mastercard transactions  network services processes a wide range of payment transactions for its predominantly petroleum customer base  including providing approximately billion transaction authorizations through its front end card processing systems primarily for visa and mastercard in and in added billion transaction authorizations since its acquisition 

table of contents in march  we acquired a majority interest in collective point of sale solutions ltd 
cpos for a net cash payment of million 
cpos is a canadian provider of payment processing services and secure point of sale solutions 
this acquisition added approximately  canadian merchants and provides us an entrance into the canadian credit and debit card processing market 
we are now able to service merchants that have locations in both the united states and canada 
we do not expect the acquisition of cpos to have a material impact on our revenues or net income 
in november  we acquired the net assets of chockstone  inc chockstone for a net cash payment of million 
the chockstone acquisition expands our ability to equip merchants nationwide with enhanced gift card and loyalty programs 
chockstone s loyalty platform helps businesses of all sizes identify their most profitable customers and market to their unique needs thereby increasing the frequency of their visits and the size of their average purchases 
chockstone s loyalty marketing and gift card solutions are used by leading brands in more than  restaurants  convenience stores  and other retail locations in north america 
we do not expect the acquisition of chockstone to have a material impact on our revenues or net income 
we have developed a number of proprietary payment processing systems to increase our operating efficiencies and distribute our processing and merchant data to our three main constituencies our merchant base  our sales force and our customer service staff 
in  we began providing authorization and data capture services to our sme merchants through our own front end processing system  which we call hps exchange 
in  we began providing clearing  settlement and merchant accounting services through our own internally developed back end processing system  which we call passport 
passport enables us to customize these services to the needs of our relationship managers and sme merchants 
currently  we are further developing hps exchange and passport to process the large national merchants which we acquired with network services 
during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our sme transactions were processed through hps exchange  which has decreased our operating costs per transaction 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our active sme merchants were processing on passport  which also has contributed to decreasing our operating costs per transaction 
with our conversion to passport  our internally developed systems are providing substantially all aspects of most of our merchants processing needs  excluding network services 
previously  we relied on third party vendors for many of these services including bankcard authorization and data capture services  settlement and merchant accounting services 
we will continue to process a minority of our transactions through third party front end systems 
the bankcard revenue we earn in our sme business is recurring in nature  as we typically enter into three year service contracts with our card processing merchants that  in order to qualify for the agreed upon pricing  require the merchant to achieve bankcard processing volume minimums 
most of our sme revenue is payment processing fees  which are a combination of a fee equal to a percentage of the dollar amount of each visa or mastercard transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction 
we make mandatory payments of interchange fees to card issuing banks through visa and mastercard and dues  assessments and other network fees to visa and mastercard 
our sme gross bankcard processing revenue is largely driven by visa and mastercard volume processed by merchants with whom we have processing contracts  as such  we also generally benefit from consumers increasing use of bankcards in place of cash and checks  and sales growth experienced by our retained bankcard merchants 
in contrast  network services revenues are largely driven by the number of transactions it processes whether settled  or only authorized  not its processing volume  as the larger merchants which comprise network services customer base pay on a per transaction basis for processing services 
historically successful efforts of our sales force have led to growth in the number of sme merchants for whom we process 
our sales force included relationship managers at december   and of   and  respectively 
we measure the production of our sales force by the amount of gross margin they install  which reflects the expected annual gross profit from a merchant customer contract after deducting processing and servicing costs associated with that revenue 
our sales performance reflects the continuing impacts of challenging economic conditions and soft consumer spending 
in  our installed gross margin decreased from levels  following a increase in over levels 
the number of total sme bankcard  payroll and check processing merchants we installed during year ended december  was  new merchants installed  compared to  new merchants installed during the year ended december  and  new merchants installed during the year ended december  
table of contents as a result of our commission only compensation system for our sales force  we are able to increase the size of our sales force with minimal upfront costs 
however  since we pay signing bonuses and commissions approximating of the gross margin generated by an sme merchant in its first year  growth in installed margin consumes significant capital  as it typically takes approximately one year s processing to cover the outlays for signing bonuses  commissions and payroll taxes 
in our sme business  we measure same store sales growth or contraction as the change in bankcard processing volume for all bankcard merchants that were processing with us in the same month a year earlier 
in  same store sales contracted by on average  compared to on average in and a growth of on average in same store sales growth or contraction results from the combination of the increasing or decreasing use by consumers of bankcards for the purchase of goods and services at the point of sale  and sales growth or contraction experienced by our retained sme bankcard merchants 
the following table compares our same store sales growth or contraction for the  and by quarter and full year same store sales growth contraction first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we attribute the deterioration in same store sales percentages to declining economic conditions including impacts from severely contracted credit markets  a weak housing market  historically low consumer and investor confidence and a soft labor market leading to higher unemployment rates 
management believes that all of these factors have negatively impacted consumer confidence  disposable income  and spending behavior  which has impacted the businesses of our sme merchants 
management believes that the current challenging economic conditions may continue to negatively impact our business 
we also derive recurring revenue from our payroll processing services  american express and discover processing  and maintenance fees on micropayment and campus solutions 
other revenues include sales of card processing and micropayment equipment and fees for additional services we provide  such as fees for handling merchants chargebacks 
we provide payroll processing services throughout the united states 
at december   we processed payroll for  customers  an increase of from  payroll customers at december  processing system intrusion on january   we publicly announced the discovery of a criminal breach of our payment systems environment the processing system intrusion 
the processing system intrusion involved malicious software that appears to have been used to collect in transit  unencrypted payment card data while it was being processed by us during the transaction authorization process 
such data is not required to be encrypted while in transit under current payment card industry guidelines 
we had received confirmation of our compliance with the payment card industry data security standard pci dss from a third party assessor each year since the standard was announced  including in april  before the discovery of the processing system intrusion 
subsequent to the discovery of the processing system intrusion  we were advised by visa that based on visa s investigation of the processing system intrusion  visa had removed us from visa published list of pci dss compliant service providers 
we were similarly advised by mastercard that  based on mastercard s investigation of the processing system intrusion mastercard believed we were in violation of the mastercard standards and that  based on that belief  mastercard removed us from mastercard s published list of compliant service providers 
in april  we were re certified as pci dss compliant and the assessor s report attesting to such re certification was reviewed and approved by visa 
as such  we were returned to mastercard s published list of compliant service providers and visa s global list of pci dss validated service providers 
card data that could have been exposed by the processing system intrusion included card numbers  expiration dates  and 
table of contents certain other information from the magnetic stripe on the back of the payment card including  for a small percentage of cards  the cardholder s name 
however  the cardholder information that we process does not include addresses or social security numbers 
also  we believe that no unencrypted pin data was captured 
we believe the breach has been contained and did not extend beyond for the year ended december   we expensed a total of million  or about per share  associated with the processing system intrusion 
approximately million of these charges were for legal fees and costs we incurred for investigations  defending various claims and actions  remedial actions and crisis management services 
the majority of these charges  or approximately million  related to i assessments imposed in april by mastercard and visa against our sponsor banks  which assessments were in turn withheld from us by our sponsor banks  ii settlement agreements and settlements reached with american express settled in december and visa agreement entered into on january  
the settlement pursuant to the visa agreement was consummated on february  iii settlement offers we made to certain claimants in an attempt to resolve certain of the claims asserted against us or our sponsor banks who have asserted rights to indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them  and iv settlements deemed likely to be agreed upon in the near term with certain claimants  such as the cardholder class action 
notwithstanding our belief that we have strong defenses against the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers and discussions described in iii and iv above  we decided to make the settlement offers and engage in settlement discussions in attempts to avoid the costs and uncertainty of litigation 
we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves against all the claims relating to the processing system intrusion that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks to date 
the accrual of the settlements and settlement offers during the year ended december  resulted in our recognizing a million reserve for processing system intrusion at december  to date  we have not reached a definitive agreement with respect to settlement offers and discussions noted in iii and iv above 
therefore  it should not be assumed that we will resolve the claims that are the subject of those settlement offers or the subject of settlement discussions for the amounts of the settlement offers or the settlement amounts deemed likely to be agreed upon 
we understand that the reserve related to the settlement offers is required based solely on the fact we tendered offers of settlement in the amounts we have accrued 
it is possible we will end up resolving the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers  either through settlements or pursuant to litigation  for amounts that are significantly greater than the amount we have reserved to date 
moreover  even if the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers were resolved for the amount we have reserved  that would still leave unresolved a significant portion of the claims that have been asserted against us or our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion 
we feel we have strong defenses to all the claims that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion  including those claims that are not the subject of the settlement offers 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with american express to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us and american express and its issuers with respect to the processing system intrusion 
we paid american express approximately million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of american express and its issuers arising from or relating to the processing system intrusion 
such settlement agreement and release contains mutual releases by and between us and american express on behalf of itself and its issuers relating to the processing system intrusion 
on january   we  heartland bank  keybank national association keybank  and  together with heartland bank  the sponsor banks  and visa usa inc  visa international service association and visa inc collectively  visa entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us  the sponsor banks and visa with respect to the potential rights and claims of visa and certain issuers of visa branded credit and debit cards related to the processing system intrusion 
after credit for fines previously collected by visa during  the maximum settlement amount under the settlement agreement would not exceed million 
we had included costs of this settlement in our provision for processing system intrusion on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and in our reserve for processing system intrusion on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  a condition of the settlement agreement was that we obtain a loan of at least million from the sponsor banks  the proceeds of which to be used to partially fund the settlement amount 
on february   we entered into a bridge loan agreement the bridge loan agreement with keybank  as administrative agent  and keybank and heartland bank as bridge lenders 
on that date  keybank made a bridge loan to us in the amount of million and heartland bank made a bridge loan in the amount of million collectively  the bridge loan  which are the maximum amounts that we may borrow under the bridge loan agreement 
we must repay the bridge loan by february  
table of contents on february   we also entered into an amendment the amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may   with the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  swingline lender and issuing bank 
the amendment provided for  among other things  a release of the lender s lien on our jeffersonville  in service center and certain other assets relating to the ownership and occupancy of the service center 
on february   we also entered into a commitment increase agreement pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement the commitment increase agreement whereby keybank as one of the lenders under the amended and restated credit agreement agreed to increase its revolving credit commitment to us under the amended and restated credit agreement by million the increased credit commitment 
the terms of the increased credit commitment are similar to the terms of the revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds of the bridge loan and the increased credit commitment  along with some of our cash  to fund the settlement with visa 
the settlement agreement was consummated on february  while we have determined that the processing system intrusion has triggered other loss contingencies  to date  an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us  or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us  and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim 
therefore  no reserve liability has been recorded as of december  with respect to any such claim  except for the assessments actually imposed by mastercard and visa  the amounts of the settlement offers we made and the expected costs of settling with certain claimants as discussed above 
as more information becomes available  if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such probable loss that we will incur on that claim is reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve for the claim in question 
if and when  we record such a reserve  it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
additional costs we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion will be recognized as incurred 
such costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
financial highlights for  our financial results continued to reflect the impacts of challenging economic conditions  soft consumer spending  and the costs we incurred related to the processing system intrusion 
poor economic conditions have unfavorably impacted both new merchant installs and processing volume at existing merchants 
for  we recorded a net loss of million  or per share compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in during  we recorded pretax charges of million  or about per share for costs related to the processing system intrusion that we incurred for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  crisis management services and settlement offers 
the following is a summary of our financial results for our sme bankcard processing volume increased to billion  compared to billion in this increase in sme bankcard processing volume was primarily attributable to the american express and discover processing volume we added in as well as a net increase in sme bankcard merchant accounts 
the number of sme bankcard merchant accounts grew by approximately from  at december  to  at december  we generated revenues on the million large national merchant transactions that we settled and on the billion large national merchant transactions that we authorized 
these compare to the million transactions settled and billion transactions authorized from the time we acquired network services in may we earn transaction based revenues on our large national merchant card processing volume 
net revenue  which we define as total revenues less interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees  increased to million during from million during the increase in net revenue was driven by the addition of revenues from network services and by the year over year increases in sme merchant processing revenues 

table of contents our general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the growth in personnel costs including wages and bonuses  medical benefits and an increase in stock compensation expense  as well as an increase in legal expenses 
our income from operations  which we also refer to as operating income  contracted to million for from million for primarily due to the unfavorable impact which challenging economic conditions had on our revenues and the increase in general and administrative expenses 
our operating margin  which is measured as operating income divided by net revenue  was for  compared to for in addition to the impact of the economy  the year over year decline in our operating margin was also due to the addition of network services  whose operating margin is significantly lower than that of our historic business  for the full year 
our effective income tax rate for was  which compares to an effective tax rate of for minimum state tax income tax expenses recorded in resulted in the relatively lower effective tax rate benefit arising from our loss 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
our revenues fall into three categories gross processing revenue  payroll processing revenue and equipment related income 
our gross processing revenue primarily consists of discount  per transaction network services prices its card processing fees entirely on a per transaction basis and periodic primarily monthly fees from the processing of visa  mastercard  american express and discover transactions  for merchants and authorization of transactions by network services 
these fees are negotiated by our relationship managers with each merchant 
gross processing revenue also includes american express and discover servicing fees  customer service fees  fees for processing chargebacks  termination fees on terminated contracts  check processing fees  gift and loyalty card fees and other miscellaneous revenue 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
payroll processing revenue includes fees charged by our subsidiary  heartland payroll company  for payroll processing services  including check printing  direct deposit  related federal  state and local tax deposits and providing accounting documentation and interest income earned on funds held for customers 
revenues are recorded at the time service is provided 
equipment related income includes revenues from the sale  rental and deployment of bankcard and check processing terminals 
since january   our equipment related income also includes revenues from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for prepaid card and stored value card payment systems 
beginning october   we added revenues from the sale of hardware  software and associated services for campus payment solutions to our equipment related income 
equipment revenues are recorded at the time of shipment  or the provision of service 
most of these revenue items will tend to grow with our merchant growth 
expenses 
our most significant expense is interchange fees  which are set by the visa and mastercard card networks  and are paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme bankcard processing  we do not offset bankcard processing revenues and interchange fees because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their daily transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
as network services does not advance interchange fees to its merchants  we record its portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees 
interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar volume processed plus a per transaction fee 
we also pay visa and mastercard network dues  assessments and fees  which are a combination of a percentage of the dollar volume processed and per transaction fees 
interchange fees and dues  assessments and fees are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
it is our policy to pass along to our merchants any changes in interchange fees and card network dues  assessments and fees 
since the card networks regularly adjust those rates  our gross processing revenue will increase or decrease  but all the impact will be paid to the card issuing banks and our income from operations will not be affected 
costs of services also include processing and servicing costs  customer acquisition costs  and depreciation and amortization 
processing and servicing costs include processing costs  which are either paid to third parties  including our bank sponsors  or represent the cost of our own authorization capture and accounting settlement systems 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs and increased due to our addition of network services 
during  third party costs represented about of our processing costs  compared to during approximately of our third party processing costs in were paid to fujitsu and alliance for processing network services transactions 
approximately  and  respectively  of our third party processing costs in  and were paid to tsys acquiring solutions  
table of contents residual commission payments to our relationship managers  sales managers  trade associations  agent banks and value added resellers  which are a percentage of the gross margin we generated from our merchant contracts during the accounting period  the costs of operating our service center  including telecommunications costs  personnel costs  occupancy costs  losses due to merchant defaults  depreciation and amortization  and other direct merchant servicing costs  and the costs of bankcard terminals  prepaid card and stored value hardware deployed  and merchant supplies 
customer acquisition costs reflect the amortization over the initial three year contract term of the cash signing bonus paid and the deferred acquisition costs for vested relationship managers and sales managers  as well as changes in the accrued buyout liability  which reflect the impact of buying out residual commissions see critical accounting estimates accrued buyout liability and volume attrition 
depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we have made significant capital expenditures for computer hardware and software and such costs are generally depreciated over three to five years 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other administrative expenses related to our information technology infrastructure costs  our marketing expenses and other administrative functions 
other income expense consists of interest income on cash and investments  the interest cost on our borrowings  losses on investments  the gains or losses on the disposal or write down of property  plant and equipment and other non operating income or expense items 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the critical accounting estimates described here are those that are most important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations  including those whose application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet impacted by management s estimates are described below 
revenues our bank card processing revenue is derived from processing and settling visa and mastercard bank card transactions for our merchant customers 
our most significant expense related to the generation of those revenues is interchange fees  which are set by the visa and mastercard card networks  and paid to the card issuing banks 
for our sme merchants bank card processing  we do not offset bank card processing revenues and interchange fees because our business practice is to advance the interchange fees to most of our merchants when settling their daily transactions thus paying the full amount of the transaction to the merchant  and then to collect our full discount fees from our merchants on the first business day of the next month 
we believe this policy aids in new business generation  as our merchants benefit from bookkeeping simplicity 
however  this results in our carrying a large receivable from our merchants at each period end  and a corresponding but smaller payable to our sponsor banks  which are settled on the first business day after the period end 
as we are at risk for the receivables  we record the associated revenues on a gross processing revenue basis in our consolidated income statements 
certain of our competitors report their processing revenue net of interchange fees 
this is 
table of contents because the card issuing banks make their payments to these competitors net of those interchange fees  and these acquirers pay this reduced amount to their merchants 
since the acquisition of network services  we also record a portion of our processing revenues net of interchange fees because the daily cash settlement with network services merchants is net of interchange fees 
capitalized customer acquisition costs capitalized customer acquisition costs consist of up front signing bonuses paid to relationship managers and sales managers  referred to as the salesperson or salespersons  for the establishment of new merchant relationships  and deferred acquisition cost representing the estimated cost of buying out the commissions of vested salespersons at some point in the future 
capitalized customer acquisition costs represent incremental  direct customer acquisition costs that are recoverable through gross margins associated with sme merchant contracts 
the capitalized customer acquisition costs are amortized using a method which approximates a proportional revenue approach over the initial three year term of the merchant contract 
the amount of the up front signing bonus paid for new sme bankcard  payroll and check processing accounts is based on the estimated gross margin for the first year of the merchant contract 
the gross signing bonuses paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the signing bonus paid  amount capitalized  and related amortization are adjusted at the end of the first year to reflect the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during that year 
the net signing bonus adjustments made during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
positive signing bonus adjustments occur when the actual gross margin generated by the merchant contract during the first year exceeds the estimated gross margin for that year  resulting in the underpayment of the up front signing bonus and would be paid to the relevant sales person 
negative signing bonus adjustments could result from prior overpayments of up front signing bonuses  and would be recovered from the relevant salesperson 
the amount of signing bonuses paid which remained subject to adjustment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the deferred acquisition cost component is accrued for vested salespersons over the first year of bankcard merchant processing  consistent with the build up in the accrued buyout liability  which is described below 
management evaluates the capitalized customer acquisition costs for impairment at each balance sheet date by comparing  on a pooled basis by vintage month of origination  the expected future net cash flows from underlying merchant relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized customer acquisition costs 
if the estimated future net cash flows are lower than the recorded carrying amount  indicating an impairment of the value of the capitalized customer acquisition costs  the impairment loss will be charged to operations 
we have not recognized an impairment loss in  or accrued buyout liability we pay our salespersons residual commissions based on the gross margin generated from the monthly processing activity of sme merchants signed by them 
we refer to these residual commissions as the owned portion of such commissions  or portfolio equity 
the salesperson has no obligation to perform additional services for the merchant for so long as the merchant continues processing with us 
we accrue the buyout liability  which represents the estimated current settlement cost of buying out all vested and expected to vest salespersons for the owned portion of such commissions 
we also record a deferred acquisition cost asset related to those buyouts  and amortize that asset as an expense over the initial year contract term 
we consider a salesperson to be vested once they have established merchant relationships that generate the equivalent of  of monthly gross margin 
vested status entitles the salesperson to his or her residual commissions for as long as the merchant processes with us  even if the salesperson is no longer employed by us 
the accrued buyout liability is based on the sme merchants we have under contract at the balance sheet date  the gross margin we generated from those accounts in the prior twelve months  the owned commission rate  and the fixed buyout multiple of times the commissions 
the liability related to a new merchant is therefore zero when the merchant is installed  and increases over the twelve months following the installation date 
for unvested salespersons  the accrued buyout liability is accrued over the expected vesting period  however  no deferred acquisition cost is capitalized as future services are required in order to vest 
in calculating 
table of contents the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons  we have assumed that of unvested salespersons will vest in the future  which represents our historical vesting rate 
a increase to in the expected vesting rate would have increased the accrued buyout liability for unvested salespersons by million at december  and buyout payments made to salespersons reduce the outstanding accrued buyout liability 
given our view of the duration of the cash flows associated with a pool of merchant contracts  we believe that the benefits of such buyouts significantly exceed the cost  which typically represents to years of commissions 
if the cash flows associated with a pool of bought out contracts does not exceed this cost  we will incur an economic loss on our decision to buyout the contracts 
during  and  we made buyout payments of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to make significant buyout payments in the future  subject to available cash  as such buyouts reduce the monthly payments we will have to make to our salespersons for such merchants in the future 
reserve for processing system intrusion the processing system intrusion requires us to make assumptions and estimates concerning the outcomes and related costs and losses in connection with various lawsuits  claims  and investigations 
we make our estimates of costs based on our best judgments and anticipated outcomes of these lawsuits  claims  and investigations 
on january   we publicly announced the discovery of a criminal breach of our payment systems environment the processing system intrusion 
the processing system intrusion involved malicious software that appears to have been used to collect in transit  unencrypted payment card data while it was being processed by us during the transaction authorization process 
such data is not required to be encrypted while in transit under current payment card industry guidelines 
we had received confirmation of our compliance with the payment card industry data security standard pci dss from a third party assessor each year since the standard was announced  including in april  before the discovery of the processing system intrusion 
subsequent to the discovery of the processing system intrusion  we were advised by visa that based on visa s investigation of the processing system intrusion  visa had removed us from visa published list of pci dss compliant service providers 
we were similarly advised by mastercard that  based on mastercard s investigation of the processing system intrusion mastercard believed we were in violation of the mastercard standards and that  based on that belief  mastercard removed us from mastercard s published list of compliant service providers 
in april  we were re certified as pci dss compliant and the assessor s report attesting to such re certification has been reviewed and approved by visa 
as such  we were returned to mastercard s published list of compliant service providers and visa s global list of pci dss validated service providers 
card data that could have been exposed by the processing system intrusion included card numbers  expiration dates  and certain other information from the magnetic stripe on the back of the payment card including  for a small percentage of cards  the cardholder s name 
however  the cardholder information that we process does not include addresses or social security numbers 
also  we believe that no unencrypted pin data was captured 
we believe the breach has been contained and did not extend beyond for the year ended december   we expensed a total of million  or about per share  associated with the processing system intrusion 
approximately million of these charges were for legal fees and costs we incurred for investigations  defending various claims and actions  remedial actions and crisis management services 
the majority of these charges  or approximately million  related to i assessments imposed in april by mastercard and visa against our sponsor banks  which assessments were in turn withheld from us by our sponsor banks  ii settlement agreements and settlements reached with american express settled in december and visa agreement entered into on january  
the settlement pursuant to the visa agreement was consummated on february  iii settlement offers we made to certain claimants in an attempt to resolve certain of the claims asserted against us or our sponsor banks who have asserted rights to indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them  and iv settlements deemed likely to be agreed upon in the near term with certain claimants  such as the cardholder class action 
notwithstanding our belief that we have strong defenses against the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers and discussions described in iii and iv above  we decided to make the settlement offers and engage in settlement discussions in attempts to avoid the costs and uncertainty of litigation 
we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves against all the claims relating to the processing system intrusion that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks to date 

table of contents on december   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with american express to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us and american express and its issuers with respect to the processing system intrusion 
we paid american express approximately million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of american express and its issuers arising from or relating to the processing system intrusion 
such settlement agreement and release contains mutual releases by and between us and american express on behalf of itself and its issuers relating to the processing system intrusion 
on january   we  heartland bank  keybank national association keybank  and  together with heartland bank  the sponsor banks  and visa usa inc  visa international service association and visa inc collectively  visa entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us  the sponsor banks and visa with respect to the potential rights and claims of visa and certain issuers of visa branded credit and debit cards related to the processing system intrusion 
after credit for fines previously collected by visa during  the maximum settlement amount under the settlement agreement would not exceed million 
we had included costs of this settlement in our provision for processing system intrusion on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and in our reserve for processing system intrusion on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  a condition of the settlement agreement was that we obtain a loan of at least million from the sponsor banks  the proceeds of which to be used to partially fund the settlement amount 
on february   we entered into a bridge loan agreement the bridge loan agreement with keybank  as administrative agent  and keybank and heartland bank as bridge lenders 
on that date  keybank made a bridge loan to us in the amount of million and heartland bank made a bridge loan in the amount of million collectively  the bridge loan  which are the maximum amounts that we may borrow under the bridge loan agreement 
we must repay the bridge loan by february  on february   we also entered into an amendment the amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may   with the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  swingline lender and issuing bank 
the amendment provided for  among other things  a release of the lender s lien on our jeffersonville  in service center and certain other assets relating to the ownership and occupancy of the service center 
on february   we also entered into a commitment increase agreement pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement the commitment increase agreement whereby keybank as one of the lenders under the amended and restated credit agreement agreed to increase its revolving credit commitment to us under the amended and restated credit agreement by million the increased credit commitment 
the terms of the increased credit commitment are similar to the terms of the revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds of the bridge loan and the increased credit commitment  along with some of our cash  to fund the settlement with visa 
the settlement agreement was consummated on february  the accrual of the settlements and settlement offers during the year ended december  resulted in our recognizing a million reserve for processing system intrusion at december  to date  we have not reached a definitive agreement with respect to settlement offers and discussions noted in iii and iv above 
therefore  it should not be assumed that we will resolve the claims that are the subject of those settlement offers or the subject of settlement discussions for the amounts of the settlement offers or the settlement amounts deemed likely to be agreed upon 
we understand that the reserve related to the settlement offers is required based solely on the fact we tendered offers of settlement in the amounts we have accrued 
it is possible we will end up resolving the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers  either through settlements or pursuant to litigation  for amounts that are greater than the amount we have reserved to date 
moreover  even if the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers were resolved for the amount we have reserved  that would still leave unresolved a portion of the claims that have been asserted against us or our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion 
we feel we have strong defenses to all the claims that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion  including those claims that are not the subject of the settlement offers 
while we have determined that the processing system intrusion has triggered other loss contingencies  to date  an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us  or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us  and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim 
therefore  no reserve liability has been recorded as of december  with respect to any 
table of contents such claim  except for the assessments actually imposed by mastercard and visa  the amounts of the settlement offers we made and the expected costs of settling with certain claimants as discussed above 
as more information becomes available  if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such probable loss that we will incur on that claim is reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve for the claim in question 
if and when  we record such a reserve  it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
additional costs we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion will be recognized as incurred 
such costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
merchant deposits and loss reserves disputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of  among other things  the cardholder s dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services 
such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant s favor 
in these cases  the transaction is charged back to the merchant  which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer by the card issuing bank and charged to the merchant 
if the merchant is unable to fund the refund  we must do so 
we also bear the risk of reject losses arising from the fact that we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period 
if the merchant has gone out of business during such period  we may be unable to collect such fees 
we maintain cash deposits or require the pledge of a letter of credit from certain merchants  generally those with higher average transaction size where the card is not present when the charge is made or the product or service is delivered after the charge is made  in order to offset potential contingent liabilities such as chargebacks and reject losses that would arise if the merchant went out of business 
at december  and  we held sme merchant deposits totaling million and million  respectively 
most chargeback and reject losses are charged to processing and servicing as they are incurred 
however  we also maintain a loss reserve against losses including major fraud losses  which are both less predictable and involve larger amounts 
the loss reserve was established using historical loss rates  applied to recent bankcard processing volume 
at december  and  our loss reserve totaled  and  respectively 
aggregate bankcard merchant losses  including losses charged to operations and the loss reserve  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as percentages of sme visa and mastercard processing volume  in  and  we experienced losses of  and  respectively 
since we began processing american express and discover cards for our merchants in  we have not experienced chargeback losses 
chargebacks originating from large national merchant bankcard processing are processed and carried by fifth third processing solutions bank  which is our third party outsourced processor for settling large national merchant accounts 
stock options we expense employee share based payments under the fair value method 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
under the modified prospective transition method  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption using grant date fair value estimate and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards using the grant date fair value estimate 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved a performance based stock option program 
under this program  we granted million performance based stock options to our employees 
these stock options were granted to those employees who the board of directors determined could have significant impact on successfully integrating the recently acquired network services business and effectively executing our growth plan 
these stock options have a five year term and will vest in equal amounts in  and only if over the term of the stock options  both of the following performance conditions are achieved consolidated net revenue grows at a compound annual rate of at least  and fully diluted eps grows at a compound annual rate of at least 

table of contents management believes that achieving these performance conditions is not more likely than not to occur  therefore  no share based compensation expense has been recorded for these stock options in the evaluation of the likelihood of achieving these performance conditions will be repeated quarterly  and at such point that vesting of some or all of the options becomes more likely than not  share based compensation expense will be recorded 
in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved grants of  stock options subject to multiple vesting conditions 
under these stock options  the employee must provide continuous service over four years and a market price condition must be satisfied within those four years 
these stock options have a five year term and could vest in equal amounts in   and only if during the four year service period  the price of our common stock as reported by the new york stock exchange exceeds two or three times the exercise price for consecutive trading days 
the grant date fair values of these multiple vesting condition options are recognized as compensation expense over their four year service periods 
we estimate the grant date fair value of the stock options we issue using a black scholes valuation model for plain vanilla stock options and performance based stock options  and we use a lattice valuation model to measure grant date fair value for stock options containing market vesting conditions 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on our historical volatility for those option grants whose expected life fall within a period we have sufficient historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock 
for those option grants whose expected life is longer than we have sufficient historical volatility data related to market trading of our own common stock  we determine an expected volatility assumption by referencing the average volatility experienced by a group of our public company peers 
for plain vanilla stock options  we estimate the expected life of a stock option based on the simplified method as provided by the staff of the sec 
the simplified method is used because  at this point  we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns 
for the performance based options  the expected life is estimated based on the average of three possible performance condition outcomes 
our dividend yield assumption is based on dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option 
our risk free interest rate assumption for stock options granted is determined by using us treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option 
the weighted average fair value of options we granted during  and were  and  respectively 
the fair value of options granted during  and was estimated at the grant date using the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  expected volatility expected life to years to years to years expected dividends risk free interest rate also in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved grants of  restricted share units 
these restricted share units are nonvested share awards which will vest over a four year service period 
the closing price of our common stock on the grant date equals the grant date fair value of these nonvested share awards and will be recognized as compensation expense over their four year service periods 

table of contents amounts we recognized in our financial statements during the years ended december   and with respect to share based compensation plans were as follows in thousands year ended december  compensation expense recognized on share based plans before income tax benefit related income tax benefit recognized in the income statement cash received from stock option exercises excess tax benefit recorded for tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options tax benefit realized as reductions of estimated tax payments during the period additionally  the excess tax benefits are reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid  which is included within operating cash flows 
accordingly  cash provided by operating activities decreased and cash provided by financing activities increased by million and million  respectively  related to excess tax benefits from share based awards in the years ended december  and in  we realized million as reductions of estimated tax payments 
in  we realized million as reductions of estimated tax payments and realized million as reductions of estimated tax payments made during and million from tax refunds we received in from the recapture of income taxes paid in the excess tax benefits result from employees exercising non qualified stock options and making disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired through their exercise of incentive stock options 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair values of net assets acquired in business combinations 
we recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisitions of debitek  inc  e secure peripherals  inc  general meters corp  collective point of sales solutions ltd  network services and chockstone  inc goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred 
such changes may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and slower growth rates 
we perform annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
our evaluation indicated that no impairment exists as of december  or at december  and  goodwill of million and million  respectively  was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such indicators constitute a triggering event in other than the quarter in which the annual goodwill impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the effects of differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
judgments are required in determining the amount and probability of future taxable income  which in turn is critical to a determination of whether a valuation reserve against the deferred tax asset is appropriate 
we also account for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions 
this requires evaluations of individual tax positions to determine whether any part of that position can be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
an uncertain tax position exists if it is unclear how a transaction will be treated under tax law 
on january   we recognized a million reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet  increased deferred tax assets by million and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of million 
we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december   approximately million of which would impact the effective tax rate

the increase in our gross processing revenues from  million in to  million in was primarily due to the acquisition in may of network services  which recorded million of transaction based processing revenues in the current year  higher net revenue margin earned on sme bankcard processing and higher sme bankcard processing volume 
revenues from our sme bankcard processing are earned as a percentage of processing volume 
our sme bankcard processing volume increased to billion  compared to billion in this increase in sme bankcard processing volume was primarily attributable to the american express and discover processing volume we added in as well as a net increase in sme bankcard merchant accounts 
the number of sme bankcard merchant accounts grew by approximately from  at december  to  at december  network services recorded bankcard processing revenues on the million transactions it settled  representing billion in processing volume  and the billion transactions it authorized through its front end card processing systems during

payroll processing revenues  which include fees earned on payroll processing services and interest income earned on funds held for customers  increased by  from million in to million in  primarily due to the increase in the number of payroll processing customers from  at december  to  at december  payroll processing fees increased by from million in to million in  while interest income earned on funds held for customers decreased from  in to  in primarily due to lower interest rates in the current period and the application of available interest earning balances to offset bank fees and payables to sponsor banks 
equipment related income decreased by  from million in to million in  due to declines in the number of new bankcard merchants installed and in revenues from prepaid card and stored value card systems at our debitek  inc subsidiary during both of these declines were attributable to the weak economy in the current year 
the addition of revenues from our may acquisition of network services and our march acquisition of cpos partially offset these declines 
costs of services

costs of services represented of total revenues in  up slightly from in interchange fees increased from  million in to  million in  and represented of total revenues in  compared to of total revenues in the prior year period 
the increase in interchange fees was primarily due to the result of including network services debit interchange for the full year and only seven months in since its acquisition  and higher sme bankcard processing volume in however  interchange fees as a percentage of total revenues declined due to the nature of network services bankcard processing settlement practices 
we report network services bankcard processing revenues net of interchange fees because our daily cash settlement with network services merchants is on a net basis

total stockholders equity decreased million from december  primarily due to recording a net loss of million for the year ended december   repurchasing million of treasury shares and declaring million in dividends on our common stock 
offsetting increases in total stockholders equity resulted from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits related to those stock option exercises 
liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding we need to meet our short and long term cash and working capital needs 
we have used our funding sources to build our merchant portfolio  our servicing technology platforms  and our jeffersonville  indiana service center with the expectation that these investments will generate cash flows sufficient to cover our working capital needs and other anticipated needs for capital 
our cash requirements include funding payments to salespersons for signing bonuses  residual commissions and residual buyouts  paying interest expense and other operating expenses  including taxes  constructing our new service center and investing in building our technology infrastructure 
we expect that our future cash requirements will include material amounts required to defend against claims arising from the processing system intrusion and could include material amounts required to resolve such claims 
at times  we have used cash to repurchase our common stock 
we could in the future use cash for other unspecified acquisitions of businesses or assets 
other than borrowings we used to fund our may acquisition of network services  we fund our cash needs primarily with cash flow from our operating activities and through our agreements with our sponsor banks to fund sme merchant advances 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances  cash generated from operations and our agreements with our sponsor banks to fund sme merchant advances will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated needs for operating capital for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may face a liquidity challenge if we are unable to meet cash requirements arising from the processing system intrusion from our operating cash flow 
see overview processing system intrusion for more detail 
as potential sources of liquidity to address this challenge  we have insurance coverage to cover certain claims and expenses  and we could replace our current credit facility with a new arrangement 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with american express to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us and american express and its issuers with respect to the processing system intrusion 
we paid american express approximately million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of american express and its issuers arising from or relating to the processing system intrusion 
such settlement agreement and release contains mutual releases by and between us and american express on behalf of itself and its issuers relating to the processing system intrusion 
on january   we  heartland bank  keybank national association keybank  and  together with heartland bank  the sponsor banks  and visa usa inc  visa international service association and visa inc collectively  visa entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us  the sponsor banks and visa with respect to the potential rights and claims of visa and certain issuers of visa branded credit and debit cards related to the processing system intrusion 
after credit for fines previously collected by visa during  the maximum settlement amount under the settlement agreement would not exceed million 
we had included costs of this settlement in our provision for processing system intrusion on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and in our reserve for processing system intrusion on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  
table of contents a condition of the settlement agreement was that we obtain a loan of at least million from the sponsor banks  the proceeds of which to be used to partially fund the settlement amount 
see credit facilities for a discussion of our million bridge loan and our million increased credit commitment  both entered into on february  we used the proceeds of the bridge loan and the increased credit commitment  along with some of our cash  to fund the settlement with visa 
the settlement agreement was consummated on february  on december   we were fully borrowed on our credit facilities 
see credit facility for more details 
our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was negative by million at december  primarily due to the following i establishing million of reserves for processing system intrusion  which remain unpaid at december   and ii our revolving credit facility  which expires on september   with million in borrowings classified as a current liability 
management believes that this working capital deficiency will not cause illiquidity and that we will be able to satisfy our obligations in the normal course because i while we expect the million revolving credit facility may be refinanced  we have the flexibility to defer repayment until  and ii the terms related to the ultimate payment of the entire million reserve for processing system intrusion have not been established  but our willingness to agree to any settlement and payment thereof is contingent upon our ability to obtain appropriate financing 
at december   we had cash on our balance sheet totaling million compared to cash of million at december  and million at december  our december  cash balance included approximately million of processing related cash in transit and collateral  compared to approximately million of cash in transit and collateral at december  and approximately million of cash in transit and collateral at december  acquisition

cash flow provided by used in operating activities 
we reported net cash provided by operating activities of million in  compared to million in and million in the most significant contributor to the decline in the amount of cash provided by operating activities for was the cash payments we made related to the processing system intrusion

also contributing favorably to cash provided by operating activities was an increase in due to sponsor banks 
the increase in the amounts due to sponsor banks was mostly due to using available cash  which otherwise would have been available to fund merchant advances  to fund the acquisitions of network services  cpos and chockstone  as well as treasury stock purchases during other major determinants of operating cash flow each year are net signing bonus payments  which consume increasing amounts of operating cash as our new merchant installation activity rises  and payouts on the accrued buyout liability  which represent the costs of buying out residual commissions owned by our salespersons

contractual obligations 
the visa and mastercard networks generally allow chargebacks up to four months after the later of the date the transaction is processed or the delivery of the product or service to the cardholder 
if the merchant incurring the chargeback is unable to fund the refund to the card issuing bank  we must do so

we have been advised by the sec that it has commenced an informal inquiry and we have been advised by the united states attorney for the district of new jersey that it has commenced an investigation  in each case to determine whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws in connection with our disclosure of the processing systems intrusion and the alleged trading in our securities by certain of our employees  including certain executive officers 
we are cooperating with these inquiries 
we have been contacted by the federal financial institutions examination council and informed that it will be making inquiries into the processing system intrusion  and the federal trade commission  by letter dated february   has requested that we provide information about our information security practices 
additionally  we have received written or telephonic inquiries relating to the processing system intrusion from a number of state attorneys general s offices  including a civil investigative demand from the louisiana department of justice office of the attorney general  the canadian privacy commission  and other government officials 
we are cooperating with the government officials in response to each of these inquiries 
additional lawsuits may be filed against us relating to the processing system intrusion and that additional inquiries from governmental agencies may be received or investigations may be commenced 
although we intend to defend the lawsuits  investigations and inquiries described above vigorously  we cannot predict the outcome of such lawsuits  investigations and inquiries 
apart from damages claimed in such lawsuits and in other lawsuits relating to the processing system intrusion that may be filed  we may be subject to fines or other obligations as a result of the government inquiries and investigations described above and additional governmental inquiries or investigations relating to the processing system intrusion that may be commenced 
the card brands with whom we have not reached a settlement the non settling card brands have also asserted claims seeking to impose fines  penalties  and other assessments against us or our sponsor banks who would seek indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them based upon the processing system intrusion 
by these claims  
table of contents the non settling card brands seek to recover from us  or from our sponsor banks who would in turn seek to recover from us  assessments in respect of fraud losses and operating expenses including card reissuance costs and non ordinary course account monitoring expenses that such card brands believe either themselves or their issuers to have incurred by reason of the processing system intrusion  as well as fines and or penalties by reason of our alleged failure to comply with such card brands operating regulations 
the amounts we are required to pay to defend against and or resolve the claims by the non settling card brands described above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
costs we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion will be recognized as incurred 
such costs are expected to be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
for the year ended december   we expensed a total of million  or about per share  associated with the processing system intrusion 
approximately million of these charges were for legal fees and costs we incurred for investigations  defending various claims and actions  remedial actions and crisis management services 
the majority of these charges  or approximately million  related to i assessments imposed in april by mastercard and visa against our sponsor banks  which assessments were in turn withheld from us by our sponsor banks  ii settlement agreements and settlements reached with american express settled in december and visa agreement entered into on january  
the settlement pursuant to the visa agreement was consummated on february  iii settlement offers we made to certain claimants in an attempt to resolve certain of the claims asserted against us or our sponsor banks who have asserted rights to indemnification from us pursuant to our agreements with them  and iv settlements deemed likely to be agreed upon in the near term with certain claimants  such as the cardholder class action 
notwithstanding our belief that we have strong defenses against the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers and discussions described in iii and iv above  we decided to make the settlement offers and engage in settlement discussions in attempts to avoid the costs and uncertainty of litigation 
we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves against all the claims relating to the processing system intrusion that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks to date 
the accrual of the settlements and settlement offers during the year ended december  resulted in our recognizing a million reserve for processing system intrusion at december  to date  we have not reached a definitive agreement with respect to settlement offers and discussions noted in iii and iv above 
therefore  it should not be assumed that we will resolve the claims that are the subject of those settlement offers or the subject of settlement discussions for the amounts of the settlement offers or the settlement amounts deemed likely to be agreed upon 
we understand that the reserve related to the settlement offers is required based solely on the fact we tendered offers of settlement in the amounts we have accrued 
it is possible we will end up resolving the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers  either through settlements or pursuant to litigation  for amounts that are greater than the amount we have reserved to date 
moreover  even if the claims that are the subject of the settlement offers were resolved for the amount we have reserved  that would still leave unresolved a portion of the claims that have been asserted against us or our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion 
we feel we have strong defenses to all the claims that have been asserted against us and our sponsor banks relating to the processing system intrusion  including those claims that are not the subject of the settlement offers 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with american express to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us and american express and its issuers with respect to the processing system intrusion 
we paid american express approximately million in full and final satisfaction of any and all claims of american express and its issuers arising from or relating to the processing system intrusion 
such settlement agreement and release contains mutual releases by and between us and american express on behalf of itself and its issuers relating to the processing system intrusion 
on january   we  heartland bank  keybank national association keybank  and  together with heartland bank  the sponsor banks  and visa usa inc  visa international service association and visa inc collectively  visa entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement to resolve potential claims and other disputes among us  the sponsor banks and visa with respect to the potential rights and claims of visa and certain issuers of visa branded credit and debit cards related to the processing system intrusion 
after credit for fines previously collected by visa during  the maximum settlement amount under the settlement agreement would not exceed million 
we had included costs of this settlement in our provision for processing system intrusion on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and in our reserve for processing system intrusion on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  
table of contents a condition of the settlement agreement was that we obtain a loan of at least million from the sponsor banks  the proceeds of which to be used to partially fund the settlement amount 
on february   we entered into a bridge loan agreement the bridge loan agreement with keybank  as administrative agent  and keybank and heartland bank as bridge lenders 
on that date  keybank made a bridge loan to us in the amount of million and heartland bank made a bridge loan in the amount of million collectively  the bridge loan  which are the maximum amounts that we may borrow under the bridge loan agreement 
we must repay the bridge loan by february  on february   we also entered into an amendment the amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement dated as of may   with the lenders party thereto and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  swingline lender and issuing bank 
the amendment provided for  among other things  a release of the lender s lien on our jeffersonville  in service center and certain other assets relating to the ownership and occupancy of the service center 
on february   we also entered into a commitment increase agreement pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement the commitment increase agreement whereby keybank as one of the lenders under the amended and restated credit agreement agreed to increase its revolving credit commitment to us under the amended and restated credit agreement by million the increased credit commitment 
the terms of the increased credit commitment are similar to the terms of the revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds of the bridge loan and the increased credit commitment  along with some of our cash  to fund the settlement with visa 
the settlement agreement was consummated on february  while we have determined that the processing system intrusion has triggered other loss contingencies  to date  an unfavorable outcome is not believed by us to be probable on those claims that are pending or have been threatened against us  or that we consider to be probable of assertion against us  and we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the loss we would incur in the event of an unfavorable outcome on any such claim 
therefore  no reserve liability has been recorded as of december  with respect to any such claim  except for the assessments actually imposed by mastercard and visa  the amounts of the settlement offers we made and the expected costs of settling with certain claimants as discussed above 
as more information becomes available  if we should determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such probable loss that we will incur on that claim is reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve for the claim in question 
if and when  we record such a reserve  it could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
additional costs we expect to incur for investigations  remedial actions  legal fees  and crisis management services related to the processing system intrusion will be recognized as incurred 
such costs are expected to be material and could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
as previously disclosed  we were advised by visa that  based on visa s investigation of the processing system intrusion visa believes we are in violation of the visa operating regulations and that  based on that belief  visa removed us from visa s published global list of pci dss validated service providers 
we were similarly advised by mastercard that  based on mastercard s investigation of the processing system intrusion mastercard believed we were in violation of the mastercard standards and that  based on that belief  mastercard removed us from mastercard s published list of compliant service providers 
on april   following the completion of our annual pci dss assessment  we successfully validated our compliance with pci dss 
as such  we were returned to mastercard s published list of compliant service providers and visa s list of pci dss validated service providers 
although we have insurance that we believe may cover some of the costs and losses that we may incur in connection with the above described pending and potential lawsuits  inquiries  investigations and claims  we cannot now confirm that such coverage will  in fact  be provided or the extent of such coverage  if it is provided

we believe that the outcome of the proceedings to which we are currently a party will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have interest rate risk related to our payable to our sponsor banks 
during each month  keybank and heartland bank advance interchange fees to most of our merchants 
we fund these advances first by applying a portion of our available cash and then by incurring a significant payable to our sponsor banks  bearing interest at the prime rate 
at december   our payable to our sponsor banks was million 
this payable is repaid on the first business day of the following month out of fees collected from our merchants 
during the quarter ended december  the average daily interest bearing balance of that payable was approximately million 
the outstanding balance of our payable to our sponsor banks is directly related to our bankcard processing volume and also will fluctuate depending on the amount of our available cash 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates applied to our average payable to sponsor banks would result in a change of approximately  in annual pre tax income 
we also incur interest rate risk on borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million and a term credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the term credit facility requires amortizing payments in the amount of  on the last business day of each fiscal quarter 
table of contents commencing march  under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement  the company may borrow  at its option  at interest rates equal to one  two  three or nine month adjusted libor rates or equal to the greatest of prime  the secondary market rate for three month certificates of deposits plus and the federal funds rate plus  in each case plus a margin determined by the company s current leverage ratio 
during the quarter ended december   the average daily interest bearing balance outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement was million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates applied to our average outstanding balance under the amended and restated credit agreement would result in a decline of approximately  in annual pre tax income 
while the bulk of our cash and cash equivalents are held in checking accounts or money market funds  we do hold certain fixed income investments with maturities within three years 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an increase of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market fund holdings  but a decrease in the value of fixed rate investments of approximately  a hypothetical basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately  in annual pre tax income from money market funds  but an increase in the value of fixed rate instruments of approximately  foreign currency risk 
while substantially all of our business is conducted in us dollars  our canadian processing subsidiary  cpos  conducts its operations in canadian dollars 
consequently  a portion of cpos revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to our cpos subsidiary 
we have not hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure 
for year ended december   foreign currency exposures had an immaterial impact on our revenues and our net income loss 
at december   fluctuations in exchange rates on cpos assets and liabilities increased our other comprehensive income by million 
we do not hold or engage in the trading of derivative financial  commodity or foreign exchange instruments 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued new standards to apply the acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses and establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including assets and liabilities arising from contingencies  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired or gain realized from a bargain purchase 
is the new standards are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning after december  the new standards will impact our consolidated financial statements prospectively in the event of any business combinations entered into after the effective date in which we are the acquirer 
in december  the fasb amended the accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
as a result  our noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is to be reported as equity  separate from the parent s equity  in the consolidated statement of financial position and the amount of net income or loss and comprehensive income or loss attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest is to be presented separately on the face of the consolidated financial statements 
changes in a parent s ownership interest in its subsidiary in which a controlling financial interest is retained are accounted for as equity transactions 
if a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary is not retained  the subsidiary is deconsolidated and any retained noncontrolling equity interest is initially measured at fair value 
the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is to be applied prospectively  except that presentation and disclosure requirements are to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb amended the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset in order to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset the amended standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  and is to be 
table of contents applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
disclosure requirements are to be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of the amended standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the new standard introduced the concept of financial statements being available to be issued and required the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events as well as the rationale for why that date was selected  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
the fasb subsequently eliminated the requirement for publicly held companies to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
we did not note significant changes in the subsequent events that an entity reports either through recognition or disclosure in its financial statements 
the new standard was effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of gaap  which became the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by non governmental entities 
is the new standard was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  and was effective for us beginning in the third quarter of the new standard superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
as the new standard was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  our adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements and only impacted references for accounting guidance 
in october  the fasb issued an accounting standard update on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to establish the accounting for certain revenue arrangements in which the vendor or service provider will perform multiple revenue generating activities eg  contracts that require an up front fee along with fees that recur over the life of the arrangement 
specifically  the update addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
this update will be effective for revenue arrangements that are entered into or materially altered after january  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial statements
