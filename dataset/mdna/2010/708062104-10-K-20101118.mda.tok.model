the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview pennantpark investment corporation is a business development company whose objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments primarily in us middle market companies in the form of senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity investments 

table of contents we believe the middle market offers attractive risk reward to investors due to the limited amount of capital available for such companies 
pennantpark investment seeks to create a diversified portfolio that includes senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity investments by investing approximately to million of capital  on average  in the securities of middle market companies 
we use the term middle market to refer to companies with annual revenues between million and billion 
we expect this investment size to vary proportionately with the size of our capital base 
the companies in which we invest are typically highly leveraged  and  in most cases  are not rated by national rating agencies 
if such companies were rated  we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade between bb and ccc under the standard poor s system from the national rating agencies 
in addition  we expect our debt investments to generally range in maturity from three to ten years 
our investment activity depends on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
the turmoil in the credit markets has adversely affected each of these factors and has resulted in a broad based reduction in the demand for  and valuation of  middle market debt instruments 
these conditions may present us with attractive investment opportunities  as we believe that there are many middle market companies that need senior secured and mezzanine debt financing 
we have used  and expect to continue to use  our credit facility  the sba debentures  proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives 
organization and structure of pennantpark investment corporation pennantpark investment corporation was organized under the maryland general corporation law in january we are a closed end  externally managed  non diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the act

interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or pik 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and possibly consulting fees

critical accounting policies the discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
in addition to the discussion below  we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments our investments generally consist of illiquid securities including debt and equity investments of middle market companies 
all of our investments are recorded using broker dealers quotes or using fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors in consultation with our independent third party valuation firms 
our board of directors generally uses market quotations to assess the value of our investments for which market quotations are readily available 
we obtain these market values from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two broker dealers  if available  or by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
if the board of directors has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quote does not reflect the fair value of an investment  it may independently value such investment by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available 
debt and equity investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates 
investments of sufficient credit quality purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates fair value 
with respect to unquoted securities  our board of directors  in consultation with our independent third party valuation firms  values each investment considering  among other measures  discounted cash flow models  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors 

table of contents when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs in connection with one of our portfolio companies  our board of directors uses the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and or assist us in our valuation of our investment in such portfolio company 
because there are not always readily available markets for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value certain of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the management of our investment adviser  our board of directors also engages independent valuation firms to conduct independent appraisals of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment 
the independent valuation firm review management s preliminary valuations in light of its own independent assessment and also in light of any market quotations obtained from an independent pricing service  broker  dealer or market maker  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations of the independent valuation firms to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith  based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance related to fair value measurements  or asc  which clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
adoption of asc requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted this statement on october  this adoption did not affect the pennantpark investment s financial position or its results of operations 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchies level inputs that are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by pennantpark investment at the measurement date 
level inputs that are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or that are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term  if applicable  of the financial instrument 

table of contents level inputs that are unobservable for an asset or liability because they are based on pennantpark investment s own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability 
the inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation 
even if observable market data is available  such information may be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes which include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction 
the non binding nature of consensus pricing and or quotes accompanied by disclaimer would result in classification as level information  assuming no additional corroborating evidence 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
generally  all of our investments other than cash and cash equivalents and long term credit facility are classified as level our investments are generally structured as debt and equity investments in the form of senior secured loans  mezzanine debt and equity co investments 
the transaction price  excluding transaction costs  is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception 
when evidence supports a subsequent change to the carrying value from the original transaction price  adjustments are made to reflect the expected exit values 
ongoing reviews by our investment adviser and independent valuation firms are based on an assessment of each underlying investment  incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sale transactions with third parties  expected cash flows and market based information  including comparable transactions  and performance multiples  among other factors 
these nonpublic investments are included in level of the fair value hierarchy 
the fasb issued guidance on  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb  or asc this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement applies to all reporting entities  and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities reported at fair value as a consequence of the election 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted asc on october  and have made an irrevocable election to apply the fair value option to our credit facility liability 
the fair value option was elected for our credit facility to align the measurement attributes of both the assets and liabilities while mitigating volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes 
upon adoption  our net asset value increased by million  or per share  due to the fair value adjustment related to our credit facility 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  our long term credit facility had a net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation of million and million  respectively 
on september  and  net unrealized appreciation on our long term credit facility totaled million and million  respectively  which included the cumulative effect of adoption of asc on our credit facility of million 
we use a nationally recognized independent valuation services to measure the fair value of our credit facility in a manner consistent with the valuation process that our board of directors uses to value our investments 
after adoption  subsequent changes in the fair value of our credit facility will be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have not elected to apply asc to any other financial assets or liabilities 
fasb guidance on  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  or asc a 
asc a amends asc to provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
it emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same that the fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the guidance in asc a is effective for periods ending after june  we adopted asc a on june   and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and debt investments with contractual pik interest which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will generally not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such pik interest is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest on loans and debt investments if we determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect such interest 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  market discount or premium and deferred financing costs on our debt are capitalized  and we then amortize such amounts as interest income or expense as applicable 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and debt investments as income 
dividend income  if any  is recognized on an accrual basis on the ex dividend date to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  using the specific identification method  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
payment in kind interest we have investments in our portfolio which contain a pik interest provision 
pik interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income 
for us to maintain our status as a ric  substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not collected any cash with respect to pik securities 
federal income taxes we operate so as to qualify to maintain our election to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code and intend to continue to do so 
accordingly  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income as defined by the code 
if we do not distribute at least of our annual taxable income excluding net long term capital gains retained or deemed to be distributed in the year earned  we generally will be required to pay an excise tax on amounts carried over and distributed to shareholders in the next year equal to of the amount by which of our annual taxable income available for distribution exceeds the distributions from such income for the current year 
because federal income tax regulations differ from gaap  distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes 
differences may be permanent or temporary 
permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character 
temporary differences arise when certain items of income  expense  gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future 
differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes

on june   pennantpark investment entered into its credit facility  among us  various lenders and suntrust bank  as administrative agent for the lenders 
suntrust robinson humphrey capital markets acted as the joint lead arranger and jpmorgan chase chase lincoln first commercial as successor in interest of bear stearns corporate lending inc acted as joint lead arranger and syndication agent

the credit facility is a five year revolving facility with a stated maturity date of june  and is secured by substantially all of our investment portfolio assets  except for those assets of sbic lp 
pricing of borrowings under our credit facility is set at basis points over libor 
the credit facility contains affirmative and restrictive covenants  including but not limited to maintenance of a minimum shareholders equity of the greater of i of the total assets of pennantpark investment and its subsidiaries as of the last day of any fiscal quarter and ii the sum of a  plus b of the net proceeds from the sale of equity interests in pennantpark investment and its subsidiaries after the closing date of the credit facility and maintenance of a ratio of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness  in each case of pennantpark investment  of not less than  excluding any exemptive relief granted by the sec with respect to the indebtedness of any sbic subsidiary 
in addition to the asset coverage ratio described in the preceding sentence  borrowings under our credit facility and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt will be subject to compliance with a borrowing base that will apply different advance rates to different types of assets in pennantpark investment s portfolio 
as of september   we are in compliance with the terms of our credit facility 

table of contents we may raise additional equity or debt capital through both registered offerings off a shelf registration and by private offerings of securities  by securitizing a portion of our investments or borrow from the sba through our sbic subsidiary  among other considerations 
any future additional debt capital we incur  to the extent it is available under current credit market conditions  may be issued at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than our current credit facility 
we continuously monitor conditions in the credit markets and seek opportunities to enhance our debt structure considering our credit facility matures in june furthermore  our credit facility availability depends on various covenants and restrictions as discussed in the preceding paragraph 
the primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for repayment of indebtedness  investments in portfolio companies  cash distributions to our shareholders or for other general corporate purposes 
on february   our stockholders approved a proposal that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for a period of months 
for the fiscal year ended september   we sold million shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share  inclusive of the underwriters over allotment options  resulting in net proceeds of million 
this compares to selling million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of million in the prior year  excluding the underwriters over allotment option 
any decision to sell shares below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings is subject to the determination by our board of directors that such issuance and sale is in our and our stockholders best interests

as of september   we have committed million to sbic lp  funded it with equity capital of million and had sba debentures outstanding of million 
sba debentures are non recourse to us  have a year maturity  and may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the interest rate of sba debentures is fixed at the time of issuance  often referred to as pooling  at a market driven spread over year us treasury notes 
sba current regulations limit the amount that sbic lp may borrow to a maximum of million  which is up to twice its potential regulatory capital 
this means that sbic lp may access the maximum borrowing if it has million in regulatory capital 
on august   sbic lp received a sba debenture commitment of million

both fees are amortized over the life of the loan 
the remaining unused sba debentures totaled million as of september   subject to customary regulatory requirements 
see recent developments for information pertaining to the increased commitment and availability under the sba debenture program

as of september   sbic lp is in compliance with its regulatory requirements 
pennantpark investment applied for exemptive relief from the sec to permit us to exclude the debt of sbic lp from our consolidated asset coverage ratio 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to capitalize sbic lp with sufficient regulatory capital to access the maximum borrowing amount available or that we will receive an exemptive relief from the sec with respect to the sba guaranteed debentures 

table of contents if we are granted exemptive relief  our ratio of total assets on a consolidated basis to outstanding to indebtedness may be greater than  which while providing increased investment flexibility  would also increase our exposure to risks associated with leverage 
see risk factors if we incur additional debt  it could increase the risk of investing in our shares

pennantpark investment  through the administrator  provides similar services to sbic lp under its administration agreement which is intended to have no effect on the consolidated administration fee 
if requested to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies  we or pennantpark investment administration will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided  which amount will not in any case exceed the amount we receive from the portfolio companies for such services 
payment under our administration agreement is based upon our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under our administration agreement  including rent  technology systems  insurance and our allocable portion of the costs of our chief compliance officer  chief financial officer and their respective staffs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
if any of our contractual obligations discussed above is terminated  our costs under new agreements that we enter into may increase 
in addition  we will likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our investment management agreement and our administration agreement 
any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently engage in no off balance sheet arrangements  including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices 
distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to not be subject to corporate level tax on income  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute at least of the sum of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains  if any to our stockholders on an annual basis 
although not required for us to maintain our ric tax status  we also must distribute at least of our income both ordinary income and net capital gains in order to preclude the imposition of an entity level excise tax 
for the fiscal year ended september   we have elected to retain a portion of our calendar year income and record an excise tax of million 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  we declared to stockholders distributions of  and per share  respectively  for total distributions of million  million and million  respectively 
we monitor available net investment income to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the fiscal year 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed to be a tax return of capital to our common stockholders 
tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
we intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
our quarterly dividends  if any  are determined by our board of directors 
we can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit the payment of any cash distributions and  if we issue senior securities  we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 

table of contents in january  the internal revenue service issued a revenue procedure that temporarily allows a ric to distribute its own stock as a dividend for the purpose of fulfilling its distribution requirements 
pursuant to this revenue procedure  a ric may treat a distribution of its own stock as a dividend if the stock is publicly traded on an established securities market  the distribution is declared with respect to a taxable year ending on or before december  and each shareholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the ric subject to a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all shareholders  which must be at least of the aggregate declared distribution 
if too many shareholders elect to receive cash  each shareholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash with the balance of the distribution paid in stock 
in no event will any shareholder electing to receive cash receive less than of his or her entire distribution in cash 
we have not elected to distribute stock as a dividend but reserve the right to do so 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of ric status 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions at a particular level 
recent developments on november   sbic lp received a debt commitment from the sba for an additional million bringing its total debt commitment from the sba to million 
subsequent to september   sbic lp completed its sba examination in order to gain access to the full sba commitment subject to customary regulatory requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the period covered by this report  many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on a floating libor rate and typically have durations of three months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
assuming that the balance sheet as of september  was to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates may affect net income by more than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market  credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
in periods of declining interest rates  our cost of funds would decrease  which may reduce our net investment income 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates 
during the periods covered by this report  we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
