item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases 
we have three clinical stage drug candidates and several drug candidates in the preclinical and discovery stages 
each of our drug candidates was discovered and developed internally using our proprietary  unique chemical compound library and integrated discovery engine 
we retain all rights to our drug candidates and programs  with the exception of our preclinical stage calcium release activated calcium modulator  or cracm  program which is partnered with hoffmann la roche  or roche 
we believe that our competitive advantages include the clinical and commercial potential of our drug candidates  the strength of our drug discovery platform  our ability to effectively manage large scale clinical programs  our ability to enter into strategic partnerships with leading multinational pharmaceutical companies  and our network of research and clinical collaborations with leading investigators and institutions 
we believe these competitive advantages provide us with multiple  sustainable growth opportunities 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in july since that time  we have been principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates 
prior to our initial public offering  or ipo  in  we funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private placements of our common stock and series a convertible preferred stock 
in february  we raised million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our ipo at per share  resulting in approximately million in net offering proceeds 
all outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and accumulated dividends on the series a convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock upon the completion of the ipo 
in january  we raised million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share  resulting in approximately million in net offering proceeds 
in addition to raising capital from financing activities  we have also received substantial capital from partnering activities 
in october  we entered into a global collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol  one of our oncology drug candidates  which we refer to as the gsk agreement 
on june   following the suspension of our global phase clinical trial of elesclomol plus paclitaxel in metastatic melanoma  called the symmetry trial  we received written notice from gsk of their intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
the collaboration terminated on september  in december  as amended in february  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with roche for our cracm inhibitor program  or the roche agreement  which is currently in the lead optimization stage 
as of december   we have received million in nonrefundable partnership payments under these agreements with gsk and with roche  including million in upfront payments  million in operational milestones and million in research and development funding  which  together with the net cash proceeds from equity financings and the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income 
currently  we are actively engaged in partnership discussions for a number of our programs  which we expect will provide us with additional financial resources 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our drug candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials  and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales to achieve future profitability and may never do so 
oncology programs we have two clinical stage programs and one preclinical stage program in oncology sta hsp inhibitor sta is a potent  injectable small molecule hsp inhibitor drug candidate  with a novel chemical structure that is distinct from aag tanespimycin and other first generation  ansamycin derivative hsp inhibitors  such as ipi retaspimycin 
many of the known oncogenic proteins that play major roles in pathogenesis of solid tumor and hematologic malignancies are client proteins of hsp by inhibiting hsp  sta causes the degradation of multiple client proteins and the subsequent death of cancer cells dependent on these proteins 
sta has shown potent anti cancer activity in a broad range of solid and hematologic cancers both in vitro and in vivo  as well as substantially greater potency and improved safety relative to first generation hsp inhibitors 
in clinical trials  sta has shown promising signs of single agent clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile  without the serious liver and other toxicities observed with the first generation hsp inhibitors 
sta potently inhibits hsp  a chaperone protein required for the proper folding and activation of other cellular proteins  particularly kinases 
many of these client proteins of hsp such as akt  bcr abl  braf  kit  met  egfr  flt  her  pdgfra  vegfr have been shown to be critical to cancer cell growth  proliferation  and survival and are the targets of clinically validated and approved cancer drugs such as gleevec  avastin  herceptin  sutent  nexavar  tarceva  and erbitux 
in preclinical studies  inhibiting hsp causes the degradation of multiple client proteins and leads to cancer cell death 
because mutated kinases which no longer respond to treatment with kinase inhibitors remain dependent on hsp for their activity  inhibiting hsp offers the potential for treating cancers that have become resistant to targeted therapies such as kinase inhibitors 
we believe that inhibiting kinases indirectly  by disrupting the chaperone activities of hsp  provides two advantages first  a means to simultaneously attack multiple cancer promoting kinases  and second  an ability to kill tumor cells with mutated kinases that have lost responsiveness to a direct kinase inhibitor 
sta preclinical results experiments conducted by us and by our collaborators at the dana farber cancer institute  brigham and women s hospital in boston  university of massachusetts medical school in worcester  the ohio state university  university of texas health center at san antonio  and others have shown that sta potently inhibits many critical oncogenic proteins including hifalpha  kit  met  her  egfr  akt  cdk  bcr abl  braf  raf  and wt  shows an average of approximately times greater potency than first generation hsp inhibitors  such as aag  across a broad range of cancer cell lines tested  achieving  in certain cases  over times greater potency  is active against a broad range of in vivo models of cancer including breast  colon  gastric  lung  gist  melanoma  osteosarcoma  prostate  acute myeloid leukemia  chronic myeloid leukemia  burkitt s lymphoma  diffuse large b cell lymphoma  and multiple myeloma is active in models that are non responsive or resistant to first generation inhibitors  such as aag  accumulates selectively in tumors  with a tumor half life up to times longer duration than the half life in plasma or normal tissues such as lung or liver  demonstrates synergy with several widely used anti cancer therapies including taxol  tarceva  and avastin  has activity in models of cancer that have become resistant to approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gleevec  sutent  tarceva  and sprycel including the bcr abl ti mutation in leukemia  the egfr tm mutation in lung cancer  and the kit va or da mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors  and generated pronounced single agent tumor responses in a canine clinical trial  including over tumor shrinkage in dogs with certain rapidly progressing cancers 
many of these results were presented at recent scientific meetings including the april aacr meeting  the november aacr nci eortc meeting  the december ash meeting  and the january iaslc targeted therapies for the treatment of lung cancer meeting 
we are actively continuing our collaborations with leading academic researchers  which we and the physicians we work with use to help guide our clinical trial choices 
these choices include designing trials that enrich for those patients with disease characteristics most likely to respond to treatment with sta sta ongoing clinical trials in november and january  respectively  we initiated two phase  open label trials in patients with solid tumor cancers to identify the maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  of sta based on twice and once a week intravenous dosing schedules  respectively 
in addition to an evaluation of safety and tolerability  patients in each of these trials are assessed for tumor response based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  or recist  criteria 
in march  we initiated a phase open label clinical trial of sta in patients with hematologic cancers  with a twice a week dosing schedule 
in september  we initiated a phase trial in hematologic cancers with a once a week dosing schedule 
in december  we initiated phase trials of sta in nsclc and gist 
in our phase solid tumor trials  we have escalated multiple dose level cohorts in each trial 
to date  results have shown that sta is well tolerated  with the most common adverse events being mild to moderate fatigue and diarrhea  which have been manageable and reversible 
in our once weekly phase trial  the mtd has been identified  with the dose limiting toxicities  or dlts  being fatigue and diarrhea 
to date  we have not seen organ specific dlts such as liver or cardiac toxicities that have been seen with first generation hsp programs 
we have also demonstrated the increase of certain biomarker activity with increasing doses of sta in addition to the acceptable safety profile and encouraging signs of biological activity  we have seen patients with confirmed tumor responses as defined by recist criteria  patients with substantial tumor shrinkage not qualifying as confirmed recist responses  and a number of cases of patients with prolonged stable disease 
these patients had previously progressed or failed to respond to treatment with numerous anti cancer therapies including chemotherapy as well as targeted agents such as gleevec  avastin  sutent  and tarceva 
these signs of activity occurred in patients with lung cancer  renal cancer  gastrointestinal stromal tumors  melanoma  colorectal cancer  and certain leukemia types 
we expect that six to ten new trials for sta will be initiated in  the majority of which will be investigator sponsored 
the specific choice of cancer indications and trial designs is being determined based on discussions with our clinical collaborators  further analysis of the results from our ongoing trials  the analysis of preclinical data generated by us and our collaborators  and the underlying science of the interaction between sta specifically  or hsp inhibition more generally  with the proteins known to promote growth and proliferation in these cancer types 
additional hsp inhibitors we are currently developing a new series of hsp inhibitor compounds that may be orally administered and may be more suitable for long term treatment settings such as adjuvant and maintenance therapy 
we have also characterized follow on  small molecule  injectable hsp inhibitors that provide additional options for future development 
these compounds are in the lead optimization stage elesclomol oxidative stress inducer elesclomol is a first in class  investigational drug candidate that triggers apoptosis in cancer cells by disrupting cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism 
in preclinical models  elesclomol showed potent anti cancer activity against a broad range of cancer cell types  as well as an ability to enhance the efficacy of certain chemotherapy agents with minimal additional toxicity 
in september  we reported that in a center  double blind  randomized  controlled phase b clinical trial in patients with metastatic melanoma  elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel  or elpac  met the primary endpoint doubling the median time patients survived without their disease progressing compared to paclitaxel alone 
the final results of this trial were published in the on line version of the journal of clinical oncology  or jco  in october and will appear in the print version of the jco in early in november  we announced the initiation of a phase clinical trial  the symmetry trial  to evaluate treatment with elpac compared to paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic melanoma 
this trial was suspended in february based on an interim analysis that identified potential safety concerns 
preliminary results from this trial were presented at the american society of clinical oncology meeting in may and perspectives in melanoma xiii conference in october these results showed a differential response to treatment with elesclomol based on level of baseline ldh  an established prognostic biomarker in melanoma and a pre specified stratification variable in the trial 
the primary endpoint of improvement in progression free survival was achieved in the normal ldh population  of the enrolled patients  with an acceptable safety profile 
in the elevated ldh population  of patients  no difference was observed between the two arms of the trial for the primary endpoint  and a negative impact was observed for the survival endpoint 
elesclomol was well tolerated in the symmetry trial and most observed adverse events were national cancer institute common toxicity criteria  or nci ctc  grade or the most common grade or higher adverse events in the treatment arm elpac compared to the control arm paclitaxel alone were neutropenia vs 
 fatigue vs 
 anemia vs 
 dyspnea vs 
 alopecia vs 
 peripheral neuropathy vs 
 vomiting vs 
 and infusion related reaction vs 

results presented at the nci aacr eortc meeting in november demonstrated that elesclomol binds copper in plasma  facilitating its uptake into cells and enabling a transition between copper oxidation states inside the cell 
additional research by us and by our external collaborators has shown that this reaction disrupts the metabolic properties of cancer cell mitochondria and generates the oxidative stress that triggers programmed cell death 
this ability of elesclomol to disrupt cancer cell mitochondria requires normal oxygen conditions 
under low oxygen conditions  often associated with elevated ldh levels  cancer cell metabolism shifts away from the mitochondria and elesclomol loses anti cancer activity 
these results  together with the results observed in the symmetry trial  suggest that patients with elevated ldh should be excluded from future trials with elesclomol 
in late february  we obtained approval from the fda to resume clinical development of elesclomol in a specific protocol that excludes patients with elevated ldh levels 
we intend to initiate one or more clinical trials of elesclomol during the second half of we plan to use the next generation sodium salt formulation of elesclomol for all future clinical trials with elesclomol 
in december  we presented results at the american society for hematology showing that elesclomol was highly active against aml cell lines and primary blast cells from aml patients 
gsk elesclomol alliance in october  as amended in june  we entered into the gsk agreement for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol under which we received nonrefundable payments  including an million upfront license fee and million in operational milestone payments 
on june   following the suspension of the symmetry trial  we received written notice from gsk of their intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
the termination of the gsk agreement was effective on september  in accordance with the termination provisions of the gsk agreement  all rights to the elesclomol program have been returned to us as of the effective date of termination 
should we determine to continue the elesclomol program  we may do so either alone or with another partner 
under the termination provisions in the gsk agreement  we may be required to pay gsk a low single digit royalty on future sales of elesclomol 
sta vascular disrupting agent sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that appears to disrupt the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and essential nutrients 
in animal models  sta has been shown to target both new and established tumor blood vessels  in contrast to the mechanism of action of angiogenesis inhibitors such as avastin  which only prevent the formation of new tumor vasculature 
sta has shown strong anti tumor activity in a broad range of preclinical cancer models  including prostate  lung  breast  melanoma  and lymphoma 
these models have shown that sta may kill tumor cells directly  in addition to disrupting established tumor blood vessels 
this program is currently in preclinical development 
our inflammatory disease programs we have one clinical stage program and one preclinical stage program focusing on treatments for inflammatory diseases 
both of our inflammatory disease programs focus on oral  disease modifying drug candidates that act through novel mechanisms and could potentially target multiple indications 
apilimod il and il inhibitor apilimod sta is a novel  orally administered  small molecule drug candidate we are developing for the treatment of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory diseases 
apilimod appears to inhibit the production of the cytokines interleukin  or il  and interleukin  or il  and has the potential to down regulate the inflammation pathways that underlie certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we submitted the initial ind for apilimod in march we are currently reviewing preliminary results from a phase a clinical trial of apilimod in patients with ra 
based on our review of the preliminary results  we do not expect to continue development of apilimod in this indication  with this formulation and route of administration 
we believe the pharmaceutical properties of this first generation compound and formulation are not optimized for systemic  oral administration and are currently exploring the possibility of using apilimod in alternative formulations  which may deliver locally higher concentrations 
additional il inhibitors in addition to apilimod  we have also identified several other small molecule il inhibitors that we believe have comparable activity to apilimod with significantly improved pharmaceutical properties 
we believe that these new compounds represent a promising opportunity to develop next generation drug candidates that could be administered orally at higher doses than apilimod and potentially address a wider range of serious inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs 
cracm ion channel inhibitors we have developed novel  small molecule inhibitors of cracm ion channels expressed on immune cells 
our cracm ion channel inhibitors have shown strong anti inflammatory activity in preclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo  inhibiting t cell and mast cell activity  including cytokine release  degranulation  and immune cell proliferation 
potential applications include a wide range of inflammatory diseases and disorders for which modulating t cell and mast cell function has been shown to be critical  including ra  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
in december  we entered into a global partnership with roche to further develop our cracm inhibitors 
in february  we entered into an amendment of the underlying agreement with roche 
we currently have one compound in preclinical development and are targeting filing an ind application for this compound in late or early we also have additional cracm inhibitors in lead optimization 
because there are a number of cracm ion channel targets on immune cells  we believe that our next generation cracm inhibitor compounds could potentially apply to different immune system diseases and address distinct therapeutic areas  such as ra  allergy  asthma  and transplant rejection 
roche cracm inhibitor alliance in december  as amended in february  we entered into the roche agreement to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels 
the goal of this alliance is to develop a novel category of oral  disease modifying agents for the treatment of ra  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
under the terms of the roche agreement  roche funds research and development to be conducted by us  which includes discovery and certain early development activities for our novel cracm inhibitors 
roche will receive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain products identified prior to the end of the research period 
for these licensed products  roche is responsible for development and commercialization  while we retain certain co development and co promotion rights 
the financial terms of the roche agreement include a million non refundable upfront license fee that we received in january  which was recorded as a collaboration receivable as of december   and reimbursement by roche of all of our research  preclinical development  and clinical development costs  based upon the research and development plans agreed to by the parties 
these costs include committed research support over the initial two year research period  the duration of which may be extended upon mutual agreement by the parties 
as of december   we have received approximately million in research and development support under the roche agreement 
in addition to the committed research support  and preclinical and clinical cost reimbursement  we are eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties for products developed as a result of this collaboration 
development milestones across multiple indications of up to million could be earned for the first product  and up to half of this amount could be earned for each of the second and third products 
commercialization milestones of up to million could be earned for each of three products 
we will receive tiered royalties on sales of all approved  marketed products 
roche may terminate the agreement on a licensed compound by licensed compound basis upon providing advance written notice  but may not do so with respect to all licensed compounds until after a specified date 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
our revenues have been generated primarily through partnership agreements with gsk and roche 
the terms of these agreements include payment to us of upfront license fees  milestone payments  research and development cost sharing  royalties and profit sharing 
we will seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships 
upfront license payments and milestones are recognized ratably as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the estimated performance period and any changes in the estimated performance period could result in substantial changes to the period over which these revenues are recognized see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
in the future  we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under the roche agreement and from future collaborations or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our drug candidates  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research  preclinical and clinical activities  payments to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials  personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and travel  and overhead expenses  including rent and maintenance of our facilities  and laboratory and other supplies 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing our drug candidates 
we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trial  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending or enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
in  we anticipate that our overall research and development expenses for personnel and external costs will decrease principally due to non recurring costs incurred in in connection with our elesclomol program that was suspended in the first quarter of  as well as a realignment of our resources to focus on advancing the cracm research program to identify the second licensed compound thereby shifting preclinical and clinical development of the first licensed compound to roche 
however  we anticipate that these decreases will be offset in part due to the further clinical advancement of sta and the planned restart of clinical development in elesclomol in the second half of beyond our current lead drug candidates  we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success  as well as commercial potential 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance  business and commercial development  investor and medical community relations  human resources and administrative functions 
other costs include stock based compensation costs  directors and officers liability insurance premiums  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  fees for general legal  accounting  public company requirements and compliance  and other professional services  as well as overhead related costs not otherwise included in research and development 
in  we anticipate that our overall general and administrative expenses will remain at levels similar to the second half of restructuring on march   we committed to a restructuring plan that consisted primarily of an immediate workforce reduction of approximately positions  to a total of approximately positions  to align our workforce to our revised operating plans following the suspension of our symmetry clinical trial 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance and estimated benefits continuation costs and outplacement services 
in addition  we paid approximately million in unused paid time off that had been recognized as expense prior to the restructuring  including million in the year ended december  and million in the first quarter of the approximate million in restructuring related payments for severance  unused paid time off  benefits and outplacement services was fully paid in to conserve additional capital resources  we did not renew one of our office building leases that expired in august and consolidated our operations within our three other facilities 
we did not incur an impairment charge in connection with the facility consolidation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to contract research accruals  the recoverability of long lived and deferred tax assets  measurement of stock based compensation and the periods of performance under collaborative research and development agreements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
marketable securities marketable securities consist of investments in high grade corporate obligations that are guaranteed by the united states government  and government and government agency obligations that are classified as available for sale 
since these securities are available to fund current operations they are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust the cost of available for sale debt securities for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
we include such amortization and accretion in interest and investment income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value  if any  that we judge to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in interest and investment income 
to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists  we consider whether we intend to sell the debt security and  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
during the years ended december  and  we determined that no securities were other than temporarily impaired 
marketable securities are stated at fair value  including accrued interest  with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity deficit 
the fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded no realized gains or losses on marketable securities 
revenue recognition collaboration and license agreements our principal sources of revenue may include upfront license payments  development milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  profit sharing payments  sales milestones and royalties from our collaborations 
the application of accounting rules requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the fair value to be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we evaluate the multiple deliverables within our respective collaborations to determine whether the delivered elements that are our obligation have value to our collaborators on a stand alone basis and whether objective reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items exists 
deliverables that meet these criteria are considered a separate unit of accounting 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined and accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then applied to each separate unit of accounting 
our deliverables under our collaboration agreements  including the related rights and obligations  contractual cash flows and performance periods  are more fully described in notes and of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain of the deliverables have been combined as a single unit of accounting 
the cash flows associated with the single unit of accounting from the research and development portions of our collaborations are recognized as revenue using a time based model 
under this model  cash flow streams are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period 
upon achievement of milestones  as defined in the collaboration agreements  revenue is recognized to the extent the accumulated service time  if any  has occurred 
the remainder is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining estimated performance period 
a change in the period of time expected to complete the deliverable is accounted for as a change in estimate on a prospective basis 
revenue is limited to amounts that are nonrefundable and that our collaborators are contractually obligated to pay us 
collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with gsk in october  we and gsk entered into the gsk agreement  as amended in june  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol 
the gsk agreement consisted of the following key funding streams an upfront license payment  product development milestones  operational milestones  reimbursements of certain development costs  sales milestones  profit sharing payments and product royalty payments 
on june   following the suspension of the symmetry trial  we received written notice from gsk of their intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
the termination of the gsk agreement was effective on september  the million nonrefundable upfront license payment we received from gsk in november  together with the  fair value of an option to require gsk to purchase million of our common stock  was recognized ratably using the time based model over the estimated performance period which had been defined as the year period through the earliest expiration date of the related patents  which we had estimated to be the effective life of the gsk agreement 
we were also recognizing product development milestones and operational milestones as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period 
we recognized as revenue on the date the milestone was achieved the portion of the milestone payment equal to the applicable amount of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved  with the balance deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining development period 
we achieved a total of million in nonrefundable operational milestones  including million in the year ended december  that were paid by gsk in the fourth quarter of and million in the three months ended march  that was paid by gsk in march the million in operational milestones included million related to the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and million related to the development of elesclomol in another cancer indication 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of license and milestone revenue under the gsk agreement 
in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we recognized approximately million of remaining deferred revenue from upfront payments and milestones received under the gsk agreement  all of which were recorded as license and milestone revenue as we have no further obligation for deliverables under the gsk agreement 
reimbursements of development costs to us by gsk were recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related development costs were incurred 
reimbursements by us to gsk for costs gsk incurred under the development program were recorded as a reduction of cost sharing revenue in the period in which the costs were incurred by gsk 
reimbursement of gsk s costs in an amount in excess of collaboration revenues otherwise recognized by us in a reporting period may have resulted in negative revenue 
we determined that we were acting as a principal under the gsk agreement and  as such  recorded these amounts as collaboration revenue 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized  as a reduction to revenue   million and  respectively  of net cost sharing reimbursements to gsk under the gsk agreement as we were solely responsible for funding of the development costs of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma until a specified limit of expenses had been incurred  after which continuing development costs were to be shared by gsk with us responsible for a modest share of the costs 
the requirement to pay the cumulative gsk cost sharing reimbursements did not survive termination of the gsk agreement and in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we reversed approximately million of cost sharing reimbursement liabilities as collaboration revenue 
collaborative license agreement with roche in december  as amended in february  we and roche entered into the roche agreement to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels 
the roche agreement consists of the following key funding streams an upfront license payment  product development milestones  reimbursements of certain research and development costs  sales milestones and product royalty payments 
the million nonrefundable upfront license payment that we received from roche in january is being recognized ratably using the time based model over the estimated year performance period 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of license revenue under the roche agreement 
reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche are recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs are incurred 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of cost sharing revenue under the roche agreement 
development milestones will be recognized as collaboration revenue using the time based model over the same performance period through mid no development milestones have been achieved as of december  royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales 
royalties from the sales of products included in the roche agreement will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectibility is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
sales milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accrued expenses and accrued contract research liabilities as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
given our current business  the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our business is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with all of the foregoing service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers  including contract research organizations  invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated 
we currently reflect the over or under accrual of expenses directly in our operations in the period the amount was determined 
our arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed 
we recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance 
in the years ended december   and  respectively  we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods 
we currently recognize and plan to continue to recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations 
generally  these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial  monitoring the trial  closing the trial and preparing the resulting data 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial 
with respect to financial reporting periods presented in this annual report on form k  and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers  the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs 
in light of the foregoing  we do not believe our estimates of future expenses and our practice of making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future 
there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material effect on our net income loss for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants 
the black scholes model requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility and expected lives of the options 
since we have a limited history of stock activity  expected volatility for the period from april  through december  was based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock and the historical volatility data from several guideline public biotechnology companies similar in size and value to us that also have stock compensation plans with similar terms 
prior to april   expected volatility was based solely on historical data from several similar guideline public biotechnology companies with similar stock compensation plans and terms 
we will continue using our historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility alone is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
our options generally vest after one year of service and quarterly over three years thereafter 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we applied a forfeiture rate of to all options that vest upon completion of the first year of service following the date of grant 
the analysis will be re evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
since january   we have used the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortize the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to non employees by valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
our net income loss included compensation costs in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangements for employee and non employee awards 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized stock based compensation expense was million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years

in the year ended december   we began recognizing  as a reduction to revenue  net cost sharing reimbursements due to gsk for costs they incurred under the development program 
on june   following the suspension of the symmetry trial  we received written notice from gsk of their intent to terminate the gsk agreement 
the termination of the gsk agreement was effective on september  see notes and in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
in december  as amended in february  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels and received a million nonrefundable upfront payment from roche in january reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche are recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs are incurred 
see notes and in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
as compared to in the year ended december   license and milestone revenue increased by million over the year ended december  in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we recognized approximately million of remaining deferred revenue from upfront payments and milestones received under the gsk agreement  all of which were recorded as license and milestone revenue as we have no further obligation for deliverables under the gsk agreement 
also  in  we recognized a full year of license revenue in connection with the million nonrefundable upfront payment we received from roche in january in the year ended december   cost sharing reimbursements increased by million over the year ended december  the requirement to pay the cumulative gsk cost sharing reimbursements did not survive termination of the gsk agreement and in the third quarter of  upon the effectiveness of the termination of the gsk agreement  we reversed approximately million of cost sharing reimbursement liabilities as collaboration revenue 
also  in  we began performing research and development services under the roche agreement and accordingly  we recognized million of cost sharing revenue 
as compared to in the year ended december   license and milestone revenue increased by million over the year ended december  in  we recognized a full year of license revenue in connection with the million nonrefundable upfront payment we received from gsk in november also  in  we entered into the roche agreement and recognized million of license revenue in connection with the million non refundable upfront license payment we received from roche in january in the year ended december   cost sharing reimbursements were a negative million as we began recognizing  as a reduction to revenue  net cost sharing reimbursements due to gsk for costs they incurred under the development program

on february   we suspended the symmetry trial  our global  pivotal phase clinical trial which was initiated in the third quarter of  as well as the additional ongoing clinical studies using the sodium salt  water soluble formulation of elesclomol  including the phase trial of elesclomol in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in prostate cancer that was initiated in the fourth quarter of and the monotherapy phase trial in solid tumors that was initiated in january subsequently  on march   we committed to a restructuring that consisted primarily of an immediate workforce reduction 
the million decrease in stock compensation was due in part to the workforce reduction in the first quarter of and in part to the non recurring correction recognized in the first quarter of see note in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
in  we anticipate that the overall costs under our elesclomol program will decrease principally due to non recurring costs incurred in resulting from the suspension of our elesclomol program in the first quarter of  offset in part by the planned restart of clinical development in  including the initiation of one or more clinical trials in the second half of the year 
in the year ended december   costs incurred under our sta program increased by million over the year ended december   including increases of million for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
the increases in the overall program were principally due to the advancement of clinical development  the manufacture of supporting drug supply for all of the ongoing clinical trials  and the evaluation of additional cancer types in support of several new clinical trials that are planned to be initiated in in  we initiated two phase trials in hematologic cancers  including a trial with a twice a week dosing schedule in march and a trial with a once a week dosing schedule in september 
also  in december  we initiated two phase trials in nsclc and gist 
in  we anticipate that costs under our sta program will increase as we advance our six ongoing clinical trials and further expand our clinical program to include the planned initiation of six to ten new clinical trials in additional cancer types  with the majority being investigator sponsored trials 
in the year ended december   costs incurred under our apilimod program increased by million over the year ended december   due to a million increase for external costs 
in the year ended december   costs incurred under our cracm program increased by million over the year ended december   including increases of million for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
the increase in external costs was principally due to the advancement of the program towards preclinical development 
in  we anticipate that costs under the cracm program will decrease as we realign our resources to focus on advancing the research program to identify the second licensed compound thereby shifting preclinical and clinical development of the first licensed compound to roche 
in addition  in the year ended december   costs incurred under our other early stage programs decreased by million over the year ended december   due to decreases of million for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
as compared to in the year ended december   costs incurred under our elesclomol program increased by million over the year ended december   including a million increase for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and a million increase for external costs 
these increases were principally due to expenses incurred in connection with elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  including the advancement of the symmetry trial  which was initiated in the third quarter of  and the conduct of registration manufacturing and other supporting activities required for a possible nda filing in in addition  we advanced elesclomol sodium in support of the phase trial in combination with docetaxel in hormone refractory prostate cancer that was initiated in the fourth quarter of and in support of the single agent  dose escalation clinical study in solid tumors that was initiated in the first quarter of  as well as conducted further evaluation of elesclomol in other cancer types 
in the year ended december   costs incurred under our sta program decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  offset by a million increase for external costs 
the decrease in internal related costs was principally due to a decrease in resource allocation in connection with the advancement of the sta program from preclinical development into clinical development in the second half of the increase in external costs was principally due to a full year of clinical trial costs and related drug supply manufacturing in support of the two phase clinical trials that were initiated in the fourth quarter of and the phase trial in hematological cancers that was initiated in the first quarter of  offset by nonrecurring costs incurred in to complete preclinical development 
in the year ended december   costs incurred in connection with apilimod decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and a million decrease for external costs 
these decreases were principally due to the timing of treating patients in our phase a trial for ra as the treatment for the initial two cohorts of patients was completed in and we began enrolling additional patients to explore a higher dose of apilimod in the second half of in the year ended december   costs incurred under our cracm program decreased by million over the year ended december   including a million decrease for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  offset by a million increase for external costs 
the net decrease was principally due to resource allocation 
in addition  in the year ended december   costs incurred under our other early stage programs increased by million over the year ended december   due to increases of million for personnel costs  related research supplies  operational overhead and stock compensation  and million for external costs 
general and administrative expense years ended december  comparison comparison dollars in millions general and administrative as compared to the decrease in general and administrative expense principally resulted from decreases of million for personnel costs and related overhead in connection with decreased headcount and stock compensation due in part to the workforce reduction in the first quarter of and million in external professional fees  including intellectual property and general legal fees  public company reporting and compliance costs  director and officer insurance premiums  investor and medical community relations  commercial development and corporate taxes 
in  we anticipate that our overall general and administrative expenses will remain at levels similar to the second half of as compared to the decrease in general and administrative expense principally resulted from an increase of million for personnel costs and related overhead in connection with increased headcount and stock compensation  offset by a million decrease in external professional fees  including intellectual property and general legal fees  public company reporting and compliance costs  director and officer insurance premiums  investor and medical community relations and commercial development  as well as in corporate taxes 
other expense income  net years ended december  comparison comparison dollars in millions interest and investment income interest expense other expense income  net the decreases in net interest income in each of the years ended december  and  respectively  were principally due to declining interest rates and lower average cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private placements of our common stock and series a convertible preferred stock  million in net proceeds from our ipo  and million in nonrefundable partnership payments under the gsk agreement and the roche agreement  including million in upfront payments  million in operational milestones and million in research and development support  which  together with the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million through december  we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from million as of december  this decrease principally reflects million year to date in partnership payments by gsk and roche  offset by cash used in operations as discussed under cash flows below 
the million in partnership payments consists of million by gsk for a nonrefundable operational milestone achieved in january for the development of elesclomol for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  and million by roche for the million nonrefundable upfront payment and million for research and development support in in january  we raised million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share  resulting in approximately million in net offering proceeds 
in december  as amended in february  we entered into the roche agreement and received a nonrefundable upfront license payment of million in january  which was recorded as a collaboration receivable as of december  under the terms of the roche agreement  roche will reimburse all of our research  preclinical development and clinical development costs based upon the research and development plans agreed to by the parties 
these costs include committed research support over the initial two year research period  the duration of which may be extended upon mutual agreement by the parties 
in addition to the committed research support  and preclinical and clinical cost reimbursement  we are eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties for products developed as a result of this collaboration 
development milestones across multiple indications of up to million could be earned for the first product  and up to half of this amount could be earned for each of the second and third products 
commercialization milestones of up to million could be earned for each of three products 
in addition  all commercial costs will be paid by roche 
we will receive tiered royalties on sales of all approved  marketed products

our operating activities provided cash of million in the year ended december   including the million non refundable upfront payment received under the gsk agreement in november  offset by million in the use of cash in operations 
the use of cash in all of these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations  as adjusted for non cash charges for depreciation and stock based compensation  and changes in our working capital accounts

we repaid million  million and million in capital equipment leases in the years ended december   and  respectively 
contractual obligations and commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
contractual obligations as of december  total through through more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations research and development contracts purchase obligations total including scheduled interest payments 
research and development contracts principally include contracts for human clinical studies  animal studies and clinical manufacturing 
in the event a study or manufacturing contract is terminated prior to the planned completion by mutual agreement between the contractor and us  the amount paid under such contracts may be less than the amounts presented 
under various license agreements  substantially all of which are related to our early stage discovery programs  we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million if specified development and commercialization milestones are met  as follows in millions 
these amounts are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments above 
milestone amount phase clinical trials phase clinical trials phase clinical trials completion of phase clinical trials fda new drug approval european market approval total funding requirements we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the foreseeable future as we complete the ongoing and contemplated phase  phase and phase clinical trials of sta in solid tumors and hematologic cancers and initiate additional clinical trials of sta  if supported by the preclinical data or earlier clinical trial results  complete preclinical development of an additional hsp inhibitor and initiate clinical trials of this compound  if supported by the preclinical data  continue to collect and evaluate the overall survival  or os  data from the suspended phase symmetry trial of elesclomol and initiate additional clinical trials of elesclomol  complete preclinical development of sta and initiate clinical trials  if supported by positive preclinical data  advance our cracm inhibitor program into clinical trials  if supported by positive preclinical data  to the extent that these activities are not funded by roche under the roche agreement  discover  develop  and seek regulatory approval for backups of our current drug candidates and other new drug candidates  identify additional compounds or drug candidates and acquire rights from third parties to those compounds or drug candidates through licenses  acquisitions or other means  and commercialize any approved drug candidates 
our funding requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our ongoing phase  phase and phase clinical trials of sta  any additional phase or phase clinical trials of sta we may initiate and any later stage clinical trials we may initiate in the future based on the results of the earlier stage clinical trials  the progress and results of additional clinical trials of elesclomol that we expect to initiate  the results of our preclinical studies of sta  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by the preclinical and other test results  our ability to fulfill our obligations under and otherwise maintain the roche agreement and for roche to satisfy its obligations under the roche agreement  including payment of funding obligations and milestone payments  the costs  timing  and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates  the scope  progress  results  and cost of preclinical development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of any new drug candidates we may discover or acquire  the costs of preparing  filing  and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing  and defending intellectual property related claims  our ability to establish additional strategic collaborations and licensing or other arrangements on terms favorable to us  the costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future collaborations  and the timing  receipt  and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from elesclomol  apilimod  sta  sta  our cracm inhibitors and our other potential products 
liquidity on february   we announced that we were suspending all clinical development of our lead drug candidate  elesclomol 
on march   we committed to an immediate restructuring plan that consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of approximately positions  to a total of approximately positions to better align our workforce to our revised operating plans following the suspension of our symmetry clinical trial 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance and estimated benefits continuation costs and outplacement services 
in addition  we paid approximately million in unused paid time off that had been recognized as expense prior to the restructuring  including million in the year ended december  and million in the first quarter of the approximate million in restructuring related payments for severance  unused paid time off  benefits and outplacement services had been fully paid in to conserve additional capital resources  we did not renew one of our office building leases that expired in august and consolidated our operations within our three other facilities 
we did not incur an impairment charge in connection with the facility consolidation 
we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect our continuing operations to use cash over the next several years and such cash use may increase significantly from year to year 
while we are actively engaged in multiple preliminary partnership discussions for each of our currently unpartnered programs sta  elesclomol  vda  and apilimod which could result in one or more new partnership agreements in that may include upfront payments and cost sharing provisions  there is no guarantee we will be successful in entering into any such partnership agreements on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that we will receive any other revenue through these partnership efforts in the future 
based on our current operating plans  we expect our existing funds  and the million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock in january  together with expected research and development reimbursements and million of milestone payments anticipated in connection with certain preclinical and clinical achievements under the roche agreement  will be sufficient to fund operations into there are numerous factors that are likely to affect our spending levels  including the extent of clinical trials and other research and development activities for sta  elesclomol  sta  apilimod  and the cracm program  the timing and amount of milestone payments and research and development reimbursements to be received from roche  the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials  the progress of our discovery research and preclinical programs  the impact of potential business development activities and future direction of the elesclomol program  among other factors 
these variables could result in higher or lower spending levels which could impact the sufficiency of our current funds if we are to continue operations in accordance with our current plans and achieve our intended timelines for development 
we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  the credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval that have made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
tax loss carryforwards in and in  we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we determined that we experienced a change in ownership  as defined by section  in connection with the acquisition of principia associates  inc on september   but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our ipo 
as a result  the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
as of december  we have net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million  after taking into consideration net operating losses expected to expire unused as a result of this limitation  and the remainder will expire in varying amounts through unless utilized 
in addition  as of december   we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire through unless utilized 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited as we experience future ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
our cash is deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in a short term us treasury money market fund  as well as invested in high grade commercial paper and government agency securities that are guaranteed by the us government 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles  or siv s  within our money market fund investments 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
