item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our profitability is primarily attributable to the sale of water by artesian water 
gross water sales in artesian water comprise of total operating revenues  the amount of which is subject to seasonal fluctuations  particularly during summer when water demand may vary with rainfall and temperature 
in the event temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected  or rainfall is greater than expected  the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected 
in  demand for water declined due to the effects of an unusually wet weather pattern  thereby reducing the effect of the rate increases 
we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
while water sales revenues are our primary source of revenues  we continue to seek growth opportunities to provide wastewater service in delaware  maryland and the surrounding areas 
we also continue to explore and develop relationships with developers and municipalities in order to increase revenues from contract water and wastewater operations  wastewater management services and design and construction services 
our contract operations and other services provide a revenue stream that is not affected by changes in weather patterns 
we plan to continue developing and expanding our contract operations and other services in a manner that complements our growth in water service to new customers 
our anticipated growth in these areas is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction  which may be affected by interest rates  inflation and general housing and economic market conditions 
as a result of the general economic downturn  we may not be able to increase our contract operations and other services at the rate we had previously expected 
we will continue to focus attention on expanding our contract operations opportunities with municipalities and private water providers in delaware and surrounding areas 
water division overview artesian water  artesian water maryland and artesian water pennsylvania provide water service to residential  commercial  industrial  governmental  municipal and utility customers 
gross water sales in artesian water  our largest operating subsidiary  accounted for approximately of our total operating revenues in and serves approximately of delaware s total population 
increases in the number of customers served contributed to increases in our operating revenue 
as of december   we had approximately  metered water customers in delaware  an increase of approximately  compared to december   while the number of metered customers in maryland and pennsylvania remained consistent with operational highlights rate case settlement in august  artesian water  depsc  the division of the public advocate and christiana care health services  inc entered into an agreement to settle artesian water s april application for an increase in rates 
psc order no 
was signed by the depsc on september   approving the settlement agreement  which made the existing temporary increase in base rates permanent 
since the rate was equal to the temporary increase in rates charged to customers since december   artesian water was not required to refund any amounts to customers 
this settlement also included the agreement that artesian water will not apply for a further rate increase for an month period from the date of the depsc s order closing this application 
it was also agreed that the revenue recovered by the company pursuant to the settlement does not include any recovery of funds attributable to state income tax expense  as it is unlikely that any state income tax will be paid by artesian water during the rate effective period

construction is expected to be completed mid year wastewater division overview artesian wastewater owns wastewater infrastructure and began providing wastewater services in delaware in july as of december   we had approximately wastewater customers in delaware  an increase of approximately compared to december  artesian wastewater maryland was incorporated on june  to provide regulated wastewater services in the state of maryland pursuant to the purchase agreements described below 
our wastewater customers are billed a flat monthly fee  which contributes to providing a revenue stream unaffected by weather 
operational highlights in october  artesian wastewater maryland signed two asset purchase agreements with cecil county to purchase four wastewater facilities in maryland 
these asset purchase agreements with cecil county are also subject to the petition filed by the appleton alliance described above 
as a result  closing will be delayed until the final judicial determination on the appleton alliance petition 
closing on these transactions is also subject to the approval of the mdpsc

in march  artesian wastewater filed an application with the depsc for approval of a uniform tariff applicable to all of our wastewater territories in delaware 
previously  each time we added a new service territory  an application was required to be submitted to the depsc for rate approval 
as a result of the july  depsc approval of our application  artesian wastewater is now permitted to apply its tariffed rates to any new service territories without prior depsc approval 

table of contents non regulated division overview artesian utility provides contract water and wastewater operation services to private  municipal and governmental institutions 
artesian utility currently operates several wastewater treatment facilities for the town of middletown  in southern new castle county  or middletown  under a year contract that expires on february  the facilities include a mgd and a  gallon per day wastewater treatment station 
we also operate a wastewater disposal facility in middletown in order to support the mgd wastewater facility described above 
artesian development owns an approximately six acre parcel of land zoned for office buildings located immediately adjacent to our corporate headquarters and approximately eighteen acres of land  in sussex county  on which an office facility  a water treatment plant and a wastewater facility may be constructed 
artesian engineers  previously known as meridian  provides engineering services to developers for residential and commercial development 
the acquisition of meridian in june included the assignment of certain current contract agreements to provide engineering services to developers and includes services to be provided to artesian water 
operational highlights in march  artesian utility signed an agreement with the cecil county public works in cecil county  maryland to operate the meadowview wastewater and highlands wastewater treatment and disposal facilities until artesian wastewater maryland s purchase of the facilities is closed 
this agreement also employs artesian utility to operate two water supply and treatment stations and two booster stations in cecil county 
in march artesian utility signed an agreement with the town of port deposit in cecil county  maryland to operate and maintain a water system through august  with three additional one year renewal options  pending closing on the water asset purchase agreement between artesian water maryland and port deposit 
strategic direction our strategy is to significantly increase customer growth  revenues  earnings and dividends by expanding our water and wastewater services across the delmarva peninsula 
we remain focused on providing superior service to our customers and continuously seeking ways to improve our efficiency and performance 
by providing both water and wastewater services  we believe we are positioned as the primary resource for developers and communities throughout the delmarva peninsula seeking to fill both needs simultaneously 
we have a proven ability to acquire and integrate high growth  established entities  through which we have captured additional service territories that will serve as a base for future revenue 
with recent acquisitions  we have successfully integrated their operations  infrastructure  technology and employees 
we believe this experience presents a strong platform for further expansion and that our success to date also produces positive relationships and credibility with regulators  municipalities  developers and customers in both existing and prospective service areas 
in our regulated water division  our strategy is to focus on a wide spectrum of activities  which include identifying new and dependable sources of supply  developing the wells  treatment plants and delivery systems to get water to customers and educating customers on the wise use of water 
our strategy includes focusing our efforts to expand in new regions added to our delaware service territory over the last years 
in addition  we believe growth will occur in the maryland counties on the delmarva peninsula 
we plan to expand our regulated water service area in the cecil county designated growth corridor and to expand our business through the design  construction  operation and management  as well as acquisition of additional water systems 
the expansion of our exclusive franchise areas elsewhere in maryland and the award of additional contracts will similarly enhance our operations within the state 
we believe that delaware s generally lower cost of living in the region  availability of development sites in relatively close proximity to the atlantic ocean in sussex county  and attractive financing rates for construction and mortgages have resulted  and will continue to result  in increases to our customer base 
substantial portions of delaware are currently not served by a public water system  which could also assist in an increase to our customer base as systems are added 
according to the us census bureau  delaware s population increased an estimated from to  as compared to the nationwide growth rate of approximately 
general economic conditions  particularly in the housing market  resulted in a much lower rate of new customer additions than experienced in many years 

table of contents in our regulated wastewater division  we foresee significant growth opportunities and will continue to seek strategic partnerships and relationships with developers and municipalities to complement existing agreements for the provision of wastewater service in delaware  maryland  and the surrounding areas 
artesian wastewater completed an agreement with georgetown  delaware in july to provide wastewater treatment and disposal services for georgetown s growth and annexation areas 
artesian wastewater will provide up to mgd of wastewater capacity for the town over the next years 
artesian wastewater maryland signed two agreements in october with cecil county for the purchase of specific wastewater facilities 
the closing of these transactions is delayed until a final judicial determination is received on the petition filed by the appleton alliance 
closing on these transactions is also subject to the approval of the mdpsc 
once completed  these acquisitions will add four wastewater facilities to our service area 
the general need for increased capital investment in wastewater systems is due to a combination of population growth  more protective water quality standards  and aging infrastructure 
our capital investment plan for the next five years includes projects for wastewater treatment plant improvements and additions in both delaware and maryland 
capital improvements are planned and budgeted to meet anticipated changes in regulations and needs for increased capacity related to projected growth 
the depsc and mdpsc have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting wastewater rates for current customers and capacity charges for new customers 
in our non regulated division  we are actively pursuing opportunities to expand our contract operations 
in artesian utility  we will seek to expand our contract design and construction services of water and wastewater facilities for developers  municipalities and other utilities and will continue to actively pursue water and wastewater operation contracts with municipalities across the delmarva peninsula 
artesian development owns eighteen acres of land  located in sussex county  delaware  which will allow for construction of an office facility  water treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility 
artesian engineers continues to provide engineering services to design on site and off site water and wastewater systems for developers 
also  with the expansion efforts in our water and wastewater divisions  we believe artesian engineers will provide increased design and engineering services 
protection plans in addition to services discussed above  artesian resources initiated a water service line protection plan  or wslp plan  in march the wslp plan covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participants leaking water service lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our  eligible water customers had signed up for the wslp plan 
the wslp plan was expanded in the second quarter of to include maintenance or repair to customers sewer lines 
this plan  the sewer service line protection plan  or sslp plan  covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participants leaking or clogged sewer lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our  eligible customers had signed up for the sslp plan 
inflation we are affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand our service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility costs compared to investments made to years ago  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
critical accounting policies all additions to plant are recorded at cost 
cost includes direct labor  materials  and indirect charges for such items as transportation  supervision  pension  medical  and other fringe benefits related to employees engaged in construction activities 
when depreciable units of utility plant are retired  the cost of retired property  together with any cost associated with retirement and less any salvage value or proceeds received  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs  and replacement of minor items of plant are charged to expense as incurred 
we record water service revenue  including amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts  based upon estimated usage from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
as actual usage amounts are received  adjustments are made to the unbilled estimates in the next billing cycle based on the actual results 
estimates are made on an individual customer basis  based on one of three methods the previous year s consumption in the same period  the previous billing period s consumption  or trending and are adjusted to reflect current changes in water demand on a system wide basis 
while actual usage for individual customers may differ materially from the estimate  we believe the overall total estimate of consumption and revenue for the fiscal period will not differ materially from actual billed consumption  as the overall estimate has been adjusted to reflect any change in overall demand on the system for the period 

table of contents we record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts 
the reserve for bad debts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
the company reviews the reserve for bad debts on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the reserve when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review for impairment of our long lived assets  including utility plant in service  in accordance with the requirements of fasb asc topic we also review regulatory assets for the continued application of fasb asc topic our review determines whether there have been changes in circumstances or events that have occurred that require adjustments to the carrying value of these assets 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  adjustments to the carrying value of these assets would be made in instances where the inclusion in the rate making process is unlikely 
our regulated utilities record deferred regulatory assets under fasb asc topic  which are costs that may be recovered over various lengths of time as prescribed by the depsc  mdpsc and papuc 
as the utility incurs certain costs  such as expenses related to rate case applications  a deferred regulatory asset is created 
adjustments to these deferred regulatory assets are made when the depsc  mdpsc or papuc determines whether the expense is recoverable in rates  the length of time over which an expense is recoverable  or  because of changes in circumstances  whether a remaining balance of deferred expense is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
adjustments to reflect changes in recoverability of certain deferred regulatory assets may have a material effect on our financial results

this new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after december   and should be applied on a retrospective basis 
the company does not expect a material impact on the company s financial statements due to the adoption of this guidance 
in august  the fasb issued an asu which provides guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value 
the guidance provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted market price in an active market for an identical liability is not available  an entity is required to measure fair value using a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset or  if unavailable  quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar assets when traded as assets 
if none of this information is available  an entity should use a valuation technique in accordance with existing fair valuation principles 
the company adopted this guidance in the quarter ended september  and there was no material impact on the company s financial statements 
on july   the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification  or the codification  which establishes only two levels of us gaap  authoritative and non authoritative 
therefore  as of july   the codification is the single source of authoritative non governmental us gaap  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  eitf  and related accounting literature 
all other accounting literature will be considered non authoritative 
the codification reorganizes the thousands of gaap pronouncements into roughly accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after september  as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it will not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for variable interest entities  or vies 
the model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a vie has changed significantly under the new guidance 
previously  variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a vie based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains and or losses of the entity 
in contrast  the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a vie to qualitatively assess whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity  and if so  whether it is the primary beneficiary 
furthermore  this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate vies for consolidation  rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of triggering events 
this revised guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company s involvement with a vie affects its financial statements and exposure to risks 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier adoption prohibited 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the financial statements

note fair value of financial instruments 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance clarifying that fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions 
this guidance requires an evaluation of whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability 
if there has  transactions or quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value and a significant adjustment may need to be made to those prices to estimate fair value 
additionally  an entity must consider whether the observed transaction was orderly that is  not distressed or forced 
if the transaction was orderly  the obtained price can be considered a relevant observable input for determining fair value 
if the transaction is not orderly  other valuation techniques must be used when estimating fair value 
this guidance must be applied prospectively for interim periods ending after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to we are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices 
our risks associated with price increases in chemicals  electricity and other commodities are mitigated by our ability to recover our costs through rate increases to our customers 
we have also sought to mitigate future significant electric price increases by signing a two year supply contract  at a fixed price
