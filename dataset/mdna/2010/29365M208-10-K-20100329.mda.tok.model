overview we are a development stage medical device company focused on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity  its associated co morbidities  and other gastrointestinal disorders 
our proprietary neuroblocking technology  which we refer to as vbloc therapy  is designed to intermittently block the vagus nerve using high frequency  low energy  electrical impulses 
we have a limited operating history and we currently have no products approved for sale 
our initial product under development is the maestro system  which uses vbloc therapy to limit the expansion of the stomach  help control hunger sensations between meals  reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness 
we were formerly known as beta medical  inc and were incorporated in minnesota on december  we later reincorporated in delaware on july  since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our maestro system 
based on our understanding of vagal nerve function and nerve blocking from our preclinical studies and the results of our initial clinical trials  we believe the maestro system may offer obese patients a minimally invasive treatment alternative that has the potential to result in significant and sustained weight loss 
we believe that our maestro system will allow bariatric surgeons to help obese patients who are concerned about the risks and complications associated with gastric banding and gastric bypass surgery 
in addition  data from sub group analyses demonstrate that vbloc therapy may hold promise in improving the obesity related co morbidities of diabetes and hypertension  independent of  and prior to  substantial weight loss 
we are conducting  or plan to conduct  feasibility studies in each of these co morbidities to assess vbloc therapy s potential in addressing multiple indications 
we are currently evaluating the maestro system in human clinical trials conducted in the united states  australia  mexico  norway and switzerland 
to date  we have not observed any mortality or any unanticipated adverse device effects in these clinical trials 
we have also not observed any long term problematic clinical side effects in any patients  including in those patients who have been using the maestro system for more than one year 
on october   we announced preliminary results from our pivotal clinical study  the empower trial  indicating that based on an initial analysis  the study did not meet its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
we also announced that there were no therapy related serious adverse events reported during the study 
the empower trial is a multi center  randomized  double blind  prospective  placebo controlled pivotal study being conducted in the united states and selected international centers 
we further announced on november   the ongoing detailed review suggests that vagal blocking therapy may promote safe and effective weight loss as an adjunct to behavioral support  diet and exercise in morbidly obese patients 
the review further suggests that these effects were evident in both the treatment and control arms 
we are continuing a comprehensive analysis of all clinical  statistical  and engineering data to understand this finding 
based on the analysis to date  the control arm of the trial  which was intended to be inactive  apparently provided a low intensity blocking signal that introduced vbloc therapy in human subjects 
in january  we met with the us food and drug administration fda to discuss the empower trial results and the regulatory process going forward 
based on this discussion  we recently submitted an investigational device exemption ide application for a clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system in the treatment of morbid obesity 
assuming that we obtain an approved ide  successfully enroll and implant the trial and achieve favorable results  we plan to use data from that trial to support a premarket approval pma application for the maestro system  which we expect to submit no earlier than the second half of if the fda grants us approval  we anticipate we will be able to commercialize the maestro system in the united states no earlier than the second half of if and when we obtain fda approval of our maestro system we intend to market our products in the united states through a direct sales force supported by field technical and marketing managers who provide training  technical and other support services to our customers 
outside the united states we intend to use direct  dealer and distributor sales models as the targeted geography best dictates 
to date  we have relied on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of our maestro system 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of the maestro system 
we obtained european ce mark approval for our maestro rf system on march  the method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the class of the device  but for our maestro system which falls into class iii  the method involved a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device  and a third party assessment by a notified body  usually of the design of the device and of the manufacturer s quality system 
we used kema in the netherlands as the notified body for our ce marking approval process 
to date  we have generated no revenue from the sale of products  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
we expect our losses to continue and to increase as we continue our development activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placement of our equity securities and issuance of debt 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method and recognizing the expense over the option vesting period 
the intrinsic value method is calculated as the difference  if any  between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price on the date of the grant 
we also followed the minimum value disclosure provisions 
using the intrinsic value method  we were not required to recognize stock based compensation expense for employee stock options granted from inception through as the exercise prices  for financial reporting purposes  were determined to be at or above the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of our common stock was assessed and approved by our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are nonemployee directors 
in determining the appropriateness of the fair value of our common stock  the board of directors considered several factors  such as our life cycle  results of research and development  recent financings and financial projections 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for share based payments  which superseded the previous accounting method  and requires compensation expense to be recognized using a fair value based method for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
companies are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we adopted the new provisions using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december  all option grants valued after january  are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
estimates of stock based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements  but these expenses are based on the black scholes pricing model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the application of share based payment principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
the fair value method is applied to all share based payment awards issued to employees and where appropriate  nonemployees  unless another source of literature applies 
when determining the measurement date of a nonemployee s share based payment award  the company measures the stock options at fair value and remeasures such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant and each subsequent reporting period until the services are completed or a significant disincentive for nonperformance occurs  we make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
common stock warrant liability effective january   we adopted new authoritative accounting guidance regarding the financial reporting for outstanding equity linked financial instruments 
this adoption required certain warrants issued by us to be recorded as a liability and recorded at fair value 
calculating the fair value of the warrant liability requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which requires our best estimates  and involves inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
the common stock warrant liability and related changes in fair value are significant to our consolidated financial statements and is based on a weighted average black scholes valuation model  however the warrant liability will never result in the payment of cash by us 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
under the provisions of sections and of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
a valuation allowance has been established to reserve the potential benefits of these carryforwards and tax credits in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
if a change in our ownership is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits in any fiscal year may be significantly limited 
financial overview revenue to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not generated any revenue 
on october  we announced that our empower trial did not meet its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
as such  we do not expect to generate revenue earlier than the second half of and then  only if we receive an approved ide for a clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system  successfully enroll and implant the clinical trial  achieve favorable results and receive fda approval of our maestro system 
any revenue from initial sales of a new product is difficult to predict and in any event will only modestly reduce our continued and increasing losses resulting from our research and development and other activities 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering  product development and clinical and regulatory expenses  incurred in the development of our maestro system 
research and development expenses also include employee compensation  including stock based compensation  consulting services  outside services  materials  supplies  depreciation and travel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
from inception through december   we have incurred a total of million in research and development expenses 
our research and development expenditures in and beyond will largely depend on our regulatory path forward 
if the fda grants us approval on an ide application for a clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system in the treatment of morbid obesity we would expect research and development expenditures to increase in support of a new clinical trial in addition to the continued follow up on existing trials  such as vbloc dm enable and empower 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  finance  market development and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include costs associated with attending medical conferences  professional fees for legal  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain broad protection for the intellectual property related to our products  and accounting services  cash management fees  consulting fees and travel expenses 
from inception through december   we have incurred million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to decreases of million  million and million in professional services  device costs and compensation and benefits expense  respectively 
professional services and device cost decreases are driven by the completion of enrollment and implants in our empower trial during we are currently incurring costs related to follow up visits  which are less expensive than the cost of the implantation procedure  and do not require us to incur new device costs 
the reduction in compensation and benefits expense is the result of a reduction in force completed december  and a reduction in force completed october  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the years ended december  and although total annual selling  general and administrative expenses were consistent  various components fluctuated year over year 
there were increases of  and  in compensation and benefits expense and professional services  respectively 
the increases were driven by limited activities in support of commercializing the maestro system in the event our empower trial met its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and the fda granted us approval to market our maestro system 
these limited activities were put on hold when we determined that our empower trial failed to meet the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
the increases were offset by decreases of  and  in employee stock based compensation expense and reduced travel expense  respectively 
the decrease in employee stock based compensation expense is primarily the result of the cancellation and related forfeiture of several stock options granted in with milestone features that were not achieved in interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to a decrease in short term interest rates and a reduction in total cash available to invest 
the average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreased average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance is the result of million in net cash used in operating and investing activities from january  through december  together with million in debt principal payments during the same time period  offset by million of debt funding received in november  million of net private placement proceeds received february   million of additional debt funding received in april and million of net registered direct proceeds received october  interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily the result of entering into a million debt facility  of which million was funded in november that resulted in net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off and the funding of the remaining million in april the effective rates on the million and million debt fundings are approximately and  respectively  compared to the old debt facility containing several outstanding loans with effective interest rates primarily ranging from approximately to 
on december  we voluntarily prepaid two of the outstanding term loans in full  or approximately of the outstanding principal balance 
the prepayment of the term loans resulted in a final payment fee of  and the acceleration of  of unamortized discount on notes payable  both recorded as interest expense in change in value of warrant liability 
the change in value of warrant liability was million for the year ended december   compared to zero for the year ended december  this is the result of a change in accounting principle effective january   which resulted in warrants issued november with a recorded value of million on december  being reclassified from equity to a liability 
on september   silicon valley bank completed a cashless exercise of  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share 
the related warrant liability was marked to market on the date of exercise and reclassified to equity 
the change in fair value of these warrants from january  to the date of exercise was million 
on october   western technology investment completed a cashless exercise of  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share 
the related warrant liability was marked to market on the date of exercise and reclassified to equity 
the change in fair value of these warrants from january  to the date of exercise was  the fair market value of the remaining  warrants  with a weighted average exercise price of  was  as of december  the fair market value for these remaining awards was calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which resulted in a  decrease for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of our stock price decreasing from a closing price of on january  to on december  comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to a million increase in compensation expenses associated with increased headcount to support the empower trial and a million increase in professional services primarily due to empower patient recruiting and payments to the empower clinical study sites  partially offset by product development and research reductions for contractor separations upon completion of the maestro rc system  contractor conversions and pre clinical animal study reductions 
included in research and development expenses during were  of stock based compensation charges compared to million in the million decrease in stock based compensation is primarily the result of a million one time expense for the issuance of  shares of common stock to the mayo foundation for medical education and research upon the completion of our initial public offering ipo in november  partially offset by increases from additional employee options granted during with a higher weighted average option price and fair value 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increases of  in compensation expense from increased headcount and  in professional services  including legal expenses  travel and insurance  all driven by the new requirements of being a publicly traded company 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses during were million of stock based compensation charges compared to million in stock based compensation expense increased  due to a million increase resulting from additional employee options granted during with a higher weighted average option price and fair value offset by a million reduction due to an increased number of nonemployee options becoming fully vested during interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily due to a decrease in the short term interest rate environment despite an increase in the average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balance from million during to million during the increased average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance is the result of the net million raised in our ipo in november  million of debt funding received in and million of debt funding received in november  of which we received net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of entering into a million debt facility  of which million was funded in november that resulted in net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
the existing debt pay off resulted in a one time interest payment of  and the acceleration of  in unamortized discounts on notes payable 
change in value of warrant liability 
change in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability was zero for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the preferred stock warrant liability was recorded on december  when we sold an additional  shares of series c preferred stock 
upon the closing of the sale  we had insufficient authorized and unissued shares of series c preferred stock available to share settle outstanding warrants to purchase series c preferred stock  resulting in the warrants being reclassified as a liability at the estimated fair value of  on december  on may  we filed an amended certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of series c preferred stock to  as a result of the amendment  we had sufficient authorized and unissued shares of series c preferred stock available to share settle the warrants 
the fair market value of the warrants on may  was determined to be million 
the  change in fair value from december  to the amendment date was recorded as expense and the convertible preferred stock liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in december and  as of december  we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
prior to our ipo in november  we had received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock and million in debt financing   to finance equipment purchases and million to finance working capital 
through our initial public offering we received net proceeds of million after expenses and underwriters discounts and commissions and including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
in november  we entered into a million working capital debt facility  replacing the existing debt financing 
we received net proceeds of million from the first draw of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
the debt facility provided that the additional million draw was to be available and automatically fund under the terms of the loan agreement if and when the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market met or exceeded a target amount on or before june  the company s trading price achieved this target and therefore  on april   the automatic funding of the additional million was made to the company under the debt facility 
on february   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  in a private placement transaction with several accredited investors 
we received gross proceeds of million less a placement agent fee of  and certain other expenses 
on october   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering  at a purchase price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting estimated offering expenses 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
of this amount million was invested in short term money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance company or other government agency 
these money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at per share  however  it is possible to lose money investing in these funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy  primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
at times  such deposits may be in excess of insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
on january   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering  at a purchase price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting estimated offering expenses 
we believe that the funds received january   together with our pre existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and interest income we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into the second half of assuming we do not receive any additional funds 
the potential lack of liquidity through has raised a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and is discussed further in operating capital and capital expenditure requirements below and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in order to fund on going operating cash requirements beyond that point or to further accelerate and execute our business plan  including a potentially new clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system if approved by the fda  we will need to raise significant additional funds 
in view of these matters  our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to secure additional financing sufficient to support our research and development activities  approval of developed products for sale by regulatory authorities  including the fda  and ultimately to generate revenues sufficient to cover all costs 
see further discussion in the below section titled operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 
as of december   we had repaid the outstanding principal amount due to venture lending leasing v  inc a private equity fund under the management of western technology investment and compass horizon funding company pursuant to the loan and security agreement  effective as of november  the loan agreement or prior loan agreement 
the remaining unpaid balance of million in debt financing as of december  owed to silicon valley bank svb pursuant to the loan agreement is collateralized by a first security priority lien on all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
we have entered into account control agreements in order to perfect the lender s first security interest in our cash and investment accounts 
in the event we have less than five remaining months of liquidity  we are required to grant a temporary lien on our intellectual property 
the number of remaining months of liquidity is calculated by dividing cash and cash equivalents as of the end of any particular month by the sum of our total operating expenses for each of the immediately preceding five months 
the debt financing agreement also requires us to maintain a cash and cash equivalents balance that exceeds our aggregate operating expenses for the most recent five calendar month period ending prior to the determination date and secure aggregate net proceeds of at least million by january  from new capital transactions  of which million was required by june  the second covenant requiring million from new capital transactions was achieved with the completion of our private placement transaction on february  together with the completion of our registered direct transaction on october  there are no additional liquidity covenants that we are required to maintain under the terms of our debt financing agreements 
on february  we entered into a first amendment the amendment with svb to the loan agreement 
the amendment provides that svb s term loan shall be repaid with a payment of  on february  followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of  each  commencing on march  and ending on december  it also amends the interest rate due on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of  payable monthly 
pursuant to the amendment  the conditions pursuant to which the excluded collateral as defined in the prior loan agreement will be deemed to be included as collateral as defined in the prior loan agreement are changed from the failure to have five months of remaining liquidity to the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the prior loan agreement after the date of the amendment or the lender s awareness after such date of an event of default that occurred on or before such date with written notice of such event delivered to the company 
in addition  the amendment revises the financial covenants in the prior loan agreement to delete the covenant relating to five months of remaining liquidity and to change the liquidity ratio covenant to equal a ratio of i the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with svb and svb s affiliates  divided by ii the outstanding principal amount of the term loan  which is not permitted to be less than 
finally  the amendment adds a new covenant  the breach of which would constitute an event of default 
the new covenant requires that we receive aggregate net proceeds of at least million from new capital transactions after january  and before march  and to keep the proceeds of such transactions at svb until used 
we satisfied this new covenant with the closing  on january   of our sale of  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of approximately million  before deducting estimated offering expenses and placement agent fees 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  which was partially offset by depreciation and amortization  change in the carrying value of warrant liability  stock based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was primarily related to the proceeds from the maturity of short term investments partially offset by the purchase of short term investments and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from debt financing in each of the three years ended december   and  offset by repayments on long term debt 
we also received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common shares in our ipo in the year ended december  during net cash was provided by the completion of a private placement transaction that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants  offset by  in financing costs  and the completion of a registered direct transaction that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock  offset by  in financing costs 
on january   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering  at a purchase price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting estimated offering expenses 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not earned any operating revenues 
on october   we announced preliminary results from our pivotal clinical study  the empower trial  indicating that based on an initial analysis  the study did not meet its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints  while meeting its safety endpoint 
following this announcement  management has taken steps to preserve capital by halting all commercialization and development activities and focusing on a comprehensive analysis of all clinical  statistical  and engineering data to understand the trial outcome 
this resulted in a reduction in force on october  on november  we announced that the ongoing detailed review suggests that vagal blocking therapy may promote safe and effective weight loss as an adjunct to behavioral support  diet and exercise in morbidly obese patients 
the review further suggests that these effects were evident in both the treatment and control arms and that based on the analysis to date  the control arm of the trial  which was intended to be inactive  apparently provided a low intensity blocking signal that introduced vbloc therapy in human subjects 
in january  we met with the fda to discuss the empower trial results and the regulatory process going forward 
based on this discussion  we recently submitted an ide application for a clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system in the treatment of morbid obesity 
assuming we are able to obtain an approved ide  successfully enroll and implant the new clinical trial and achieve favorable results  and obtain fda approval for our maestro system  we do not expect to generate any product revenue earlier than the second half of as a result  we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years 
we believe the net proceeds from our registered direct offering closed on january  of million before deducting estimated offering expenses  together with our pre existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million as of december  and interest income we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into the second half of assuming we do not receive any additional funds  which has raised a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to fund on going operating cash requirements beyond that point or to further accelerate and execute our business plan  including a potentially new clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system if approved by the fda  we will need to raise significant additional funds 
in view of these matters  the ability for us to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to secure additional financing sufficient to support our research and development activities  approval of developed products for sale by regulatory authorities  including the fda  and ultimately to generate revenues sufficient to cover all costs 
we may seek to raise funds through the sale of additional equity or debt securities  or by entering into an additional credit facility or through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may be required to raise additional capital on more than one occasion and beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing or the fda does not approve our ide application for a clinical trial using the next generation maestro rc system  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our maestro system  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of the products and successfully deliver a commercial product to the market 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our maestro system and any products that we may develop  the rate of market acceptance of our maestro system and vbloc therapy and any other product candidates  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending  in litigation or otherwise  any claims that we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing products and market developments  the cost of explanting clinical devices  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  any revenue generated by sales of our future products  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our financial condition and liquidity position in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease long term debt  including interest total contractual cash obligations the table above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
our operating lease commitments relate to our corporate headquarters in st 
paul  minnesota 
on february  we entered into an amended loan agreement reducing our annual interest rate from to  which in turn reduces our monthly principal and interest payments from  to  commencing on march  and ending on december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of the amendment 
the table above excludes a recent two year extension of our five year license agreement with the mayo foundation for medical education and research mayo foundation entered into in under the terms of the extension  entered into on march  and effective february   the mayo foundation will receive an annual retainer of  in and we may also be obligated to pay the mayo foundation  contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events  earned royalty payments  including a minimum annual royalty as defined by the agreement  for the commercial sale of products developed and patented by the mayo foundation  jointly patented by the company and the mayo foundation  or a product where the mayo foundation provided know how as defined by the agreement

fasb approved an exposure draft that replaced statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  and modified gaap by establishing only two levels of gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative 
this was accomplished by authorizing the codification to become the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other nongrandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification has become nonauthoritative

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we may maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio  if any  are not leveraged  are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents and investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
