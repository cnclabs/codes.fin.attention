item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all dollar amounts expressed as numbers in this md a except per share amounts are in millions 
certain tables may not add due to rounding 
overview our primary source of revenues is the licensing of virtualization infrastructure software solutions and related support and services for use by businesses and organizations of all sizes and across numerous industries in their information technology it infrastructure 
our solutions run on industry standard desktop computers and servers and support a wide range of operating system and application environments  as well as networking and storage infrastructures 
our virtualization software solutions help eliminate the complexity of maintaining and managing it infrastructures  reduce both capital and operating costs  and provide a more flexible and dynamic it environment to better support the needs of business 
with our latest platform  vmware vsphere vsphere  we are helping companies along the path of cloud computing by providing compatible it infrastructures for both businesses and cloud service providers 
we have developed a multi channel distribution model to expand our presence and to reach various segments of the industry 
in we derived over of our revenues from our channel partners  which include distributors  resellers  x system vendors and system integrators 
the remainder is primarily derived from direct sales 
we have also developed a network of indirect channel partners who fulfill orders through our direct channel partners 
the majority of our revenues result from contracts that include both perpetual software licenses and ongoing software maintenance contracts 
license revenues are recognized when the elements of revenue recognition for the licensed software are complete 
software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the software maintenance period  and include renewals of software maintenance sold after the initial software maintenance period expires 
we also recognize revenues from professional services provided to our customers primarily as services are performed 
our software products are typically sold with software maintenance services 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts or the stated renewal rate for software maintenance included in the license agreement 
our software products may also be sold with professional services 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
our current financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate free cash flows to fund our expansion of industry segment share and to evolve our virtualization based products for data centers  desktop computers and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions 
we expect to grow our business by broadening our virtualization infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio  increasing product awareness  promoting the adoption of virtualization  and building long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements elas 
in the second quarter of  vmware vsphere  the next generation of vmware infrastructure  became generally available 
vmware view  which is integrated with vmware vsphere  became generally available in the fourth quarter of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  less capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs 
each adjusting item is separately presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see liquidity non gaap financial measures for further information 

table of contents vmware view represents a complete desktop virtualization solution that enables rapid adoption of virtualized desktops and establishes a desktop as a managed service model 
we have introduced  and expect to continue to introduce  more products that build on the vsphere foundation through and beyond 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we purchased springsource global  inc springsource  which strengthens our product offering by extending our strategy to deliver solutions that can be hosted at customer data centers or at service providers 
this acquisition also supports our mission to simplify enterprise information technology and make customer environments more efficient  scalable  and easier to manage 
since mid and through most of we observed that customers responded to the economic downturn with reductions in budgets for it spending 
as a result  customers were subjecting larger orders  such as elas  to a longer review process and in certain cases were purchasing products to meet their immediate needs  foregoing larger discounts offered under elas 
while the overall macroeconomic environment appears to be improving and customers appear to be moving forward cautiously with their it spending  we remain conservative in our planning and we assume a slow economic recovery in which it spending will continue to be tempered into and perhaps longer 
although we are currently the leading provider of virtualization infrastructure software solutions  we face competitive threats to our leadership position from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater resources than we do  which could result in increased pressure to reduce prices on our offerings 
as a result  we believe it is important to continue to invest in strategic initiatives related to product research and development  market expansion and associated support functions to expand our industry leadership 
we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our product development objectives through continued investment in our company  supplemented with strategic hires and acquisitions  funded through the operating cash flows generated from the sale of our existing products and services 
we believe this is the appropriate priority for the long term health of our business 
in evaluating our results  we also focus on operating margin excluding stock based compensation  employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets  the write off of in process research and development  acquisition related items  and the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs  as we believe this measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
we are not currently focused on short term operating margin expansion  but rather on investing at appropriate rates to support our growth and future product offerings in what may be a substantially more competitive environment 
our maintenance related services revenues are typically recognized ratably over periods from one to five years subsequent to the initial contract  whereas most of our license revenues are generally recognized upon electronic shipment of the software 
as a consequence  variability in operating margin can result from differences in when we quote and contract for our services and when the cost is incurred 
our deferred revenue  both current and long term  represents a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the requirements of revenue recognition have not yet been met and it consists of amounts received from customers and amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
as of december   over of our deferred revenue balance will be recognized as revenue with the passage of time or with the delivery of professional services 
the remainder is tied solely to product release events 
we believe our overall deferred revenue balance improves predictability of future revenues and that it is a key indicator of the health and growth of our business 
historically  most of our revenue contracts with international channel partners were in us dollars  but a portion of our operating expenses were  and continue to be  in currencies other than the us dollar 
this currency difference between our revenues and operating expenses historically caused variability in our operating margins due to fluctuations in the us dollar as compared to other currencies 
in conjunction with the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of  we started to invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
as a result of invoicing in 
table of contents these local currencies in which we also have expenses  variability in operating margin due to foreign currency fluctuations has been reduced 
however  increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations introduces additional risk for variability in revenue related components of our consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations  we have entered into forward contracts to economically hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary asset and liability positions 
the gains and losses on our foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the majority of the gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that we hedge  and are reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
our relationship with emc as of december   emc owned  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock  representing approximately of our total outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to a reseller arrangement with emc  which commenced in  emc bundles our products and services with emc s hardware and sells them to end users 
in  we recognized revenues of from products sold pursuant to our reseller arrangement with emc 
as of december   of revenues from products sold under the reseller arrangement were included in deferred revenue 
in  and  we recognized professional services revenues of  and  respectively  for services provided to emc s customers pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from professional services to emc customers were included in deferred revenue 
in and  we recognized revenues of and  respectively  from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
in  there were no revenues recognized related to these agreements 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use were included in deferred revenue 
we purchased storage systems and software  as well as consulting services  from emc for  and in the years ended  and  respectively 
in certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity  we contract with emc subsidiaries for support services and emc employees who are managed by our personnel 
the costs incurred by emc on our behalf related to these employees are passed on to us and we are charged a mark up intended to approximate costs that would have been charged had such arrangements been with an unrelated third party 
these costs are included as expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
these costs primarily include salaries and benefits  travel  and rent 
additionally  emc incurs certain costs on our behalf in the us  which historically primarily related to a shared system for travel 
in the fourth quarter of we implemented our own travel system 
as a result of implementing our own travel system  reducing travel costs as a result of austerity measures introduced in late  and establishing our own operating subsidiaries in locations where we previously needed to contract with emc to utilize their personnel  the costs incurred by emc on our behalf decreased in as compared to previous periods 
the total of these costs with emc were  and in the years ended  and  respectively 
as calculated under our tax sharing agreement with emc  we paid in for our portion of emc s consolidated federal and state income taxes for various periods  as well as the conclusion of the and federal income tax audit 
we paid and in and  respectively  for our portion of their consolidated federal income taxes 
under the same tax sharing agreement emc paid us in for our stand alone federal taxable loss for the fiscal year ending december  and for a refund of an overpayment 
table of contents related to our portion of emc s federal consolidated income taxes 
no payments were made by emc in and the amounts that we pay to emc for our portion of federal income taxes on emc s consolidated tax return differ from the amounts we would owe on a stand alone basis and the difference is presented as a component of stockholders equity 
in and  the difference between the amount of tax calculated on a stand alone basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded as a decrease in stockholders equity of and  respectively 
in  the difference was recorded as an increase in stockholders equity of interest expense with emc  net  primarily consists of interest expense on the note payable to emc  offset by interest income that has been earned on our intercompany balance with emc 
in  and   and  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable to emc and included in interest expense with emc  net  recorded on the consolidated statements of income 
our interest income and expenses as a separate  stand alone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
in  we resolved with emc certain acquisition related intercompany liabilities due to emc 
as a result  intercompany liabilities due to emc of were recorded as a capital contribution from emc in additional paid in capital without the issuance of additional equity by us or remittance of any cash 
prior to march  our employees participated in the emc corporation k savings plan emc plan 
emc cross charged us for the costs associated with our employees who participated in the emc plan 
in march  our employees began participating in our k savings plan and ceased participation in the emc plan 
as of december   we had due from emc  which was partially offset by due to emc 
as of december   we had due to emc  which was partially offset by due from emc 
the net amount due from emc as of december  was and resulted from the related party transactions described above 
the net amount due to emc as of december  was and resulted from the related party transactions described above 
as of december   we had of income taxes receivable due from emc and of income taxes payable due to emc 
as of december   we had of income taxes receivable due from emc and of income taxes payable due to emc 
balances due to or from emc which are unrelated to tax obligations are generally settled in cash within days of each quarter end 
the timing of the tax payments due to and from emc is governed by the tax sharing agreement with emc 
given that the amounts we recorded for our intercompany transactions with emc did not arise from transactions negotiated at arm s length with an unrelated third party  the financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows had we engaged in such transactions with an unrelated third party during all periods presented 
accordingly  our historical results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance as a stand alone company 
income statement presentation as we operate our business in one operating segment  our revenues and operating expenses are presented and discussed at the consolidated level 
sources of revenues license revenues our license revenues consist of revenues earned from the licensing of our software products 
these products are generally licensed on a perpetual basis and are generally priced based upon the number of physical desktop computers or server processors on which our software runs 

table of contents software maintenance revenues software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period 
typically  our contract periods range from one to five years 
customers receive various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
customers who are party to software maintenance agreements with us are entitled to receive product updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services revenues professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products  as these services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by our customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion  are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours incurred 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based on hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
operating expenses cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues principally consists of amortization of capitalized software development costs and of intangibles  royalty costs in connection with products licensed from third party providers  and the cost of fulfillment of our software 
the cost of fulfillment of our software includes product packaging  personnel costs and related overhead associated with the physical and electronic delivery of our software products 
cost of services revenues our cost of services revenues includes the costs of personnel and related overhead to deliver technical support on our products and to provide our professional services 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses include the personnel and related overhead  which includes depreciation expense associated with the research and development of new product offerings and the enhancement of our existing software offerings  net of amounts capitalized 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  sales commissions  and related overhead associated with the sale and marketing of our license and services offerings  as well as the cost of product launches and certain marketing initiatives  including our semi annual vmworld conference 
sales commissions are generally earned and expensed when a firm order is received from the customer 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs to support the overall business 
these expenses include the costs associated with our finance  facilities  human resources  it infrastructure  and legal departments 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues for the years ended  and are as follows for the year ended december  revenues license services software maintenance professional services total services percentage of revenues license services software maintenance professional services total services revenues united states international percentage of revenues united states international total revenues were  in   in  and  in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in the revenue mix in reflected a decrease of in license revenues and an increase of in services revenues as compared with the revenue mix in reflected an increase of in license revenues and an increase of in services revenues as compared with the shift in our revenue mix year over year is primarily due to a decline in license revenues as a result of the macroeconomic environment  while services revenues benefited from strong maintenance renewals  multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods  and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with software licenses 
in addition  the growth in services revenues year over year in increased as a result of customers becoming current on their maintenance agreements in order to receive vsphere as part of those arrangements 
as we focused on recovering back maintenance during  we anticipate revenue from back maintenance to decline in as customers have become current 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues continued to increase primarily due to our expansion of operations outside of the united states  as well as growing international demand for virtualization technologies 
we sell our products primarily through a network of channel partners  which includes distributors  resellers  x system vendors and systems integrators 
as we expand geographically  we may add additional direct channel partners 
our indirect channel partners obtain software licenses and services from our distributors and x system vendors and market and sell them to end user customers 
in addition  we have a direct sales force that 
table of contents complements these efforts 
our sales force works with our channel partners to introduce them to customers and new sales opportunities 
our channel partners also introduce our sales force to their customers 
historically  most of our revenue contracts with international customers were denominated in us dollars 
in conjunction with the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of  we began to invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
while variability in operating margin due to foreign exchange fluctuations is reduced as a result of invoicing in these local currencies in which we also have expenses  additional risk of variability in revenues due to foreign currency fluctuations is introduced when these locally denominated revenues are remeasured into us dollars 
the macroeconomic environment continues to generate some uncertainty around how much will be spent on it over the foreseeable future 
we believe that our customers continue to adopt our product platform as a strategic investment that delivers substantial cost savings  improved efficiency and flexibility for their business  however  we also believe that our customers continue to move forward cautiously with their spending 
although we experienced an increase in customer spending in the fourth quarter of which we believe is in response to previously suppressed demand and fiscal year end spending trends  we continue to plan conservatively for license revenues software license revenues were  in   in  and in  representing a year over year decrease of or in and a year over year increase of or in we believe a significant majority of the license revenues decrease in compared with was the result of the overall difficult macroeconomic environment and the related challenges that our customers faced  including reduced budgets for it spending 
despite the generally quick return on investment of virtualization  the economic environment has slowed capital expenditures 
organizations typically update their it infrastructure when adopting virtualization  but the hardware investment is a capital outlay that is several times larger than that of our software 
for the revenue growth in compared with  we believe a significant majority is the result of greater demand for our virtualization product offerings attributable to wider industry acceptance of virtualization as part of organizations it infrastructure  a broadened product portfolio and expansion of our network of indirect channel partners 
we have promoted the adoption of virtualization and built long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of elas 
elas continue to be an important component of our revenue growth and are offered both directly and through certain channel partners 
elas are core to our strategy to build long term relationships with customers as they commit to our virtualization infrastructure software solutions in their data centers 
elas provide a base from which to sell additional products  such as our application and infrastructure management suite and our disaster recovery products 
under a typical ela  a portion of the revenues is attributed to the license and recognized immediately  but the remainder is deferred and recognized as services maintenance revenues in future periods 
in addition  elas typically include an initial maintenance period that is longer than other types of license sales 
although we recognized license revenues on two of the largest elas in our history during the first quarter of  we continued to observe an overall decrease in the average dollar value of our elas in as compared with the decrease in size of our elas was primarily due to a customer shift from large elas to small and medium sized elas  and we believe this trend was correlated to the global economic environment 
in addition  during  customers purchased our solutions in smaller quantities to meet their immediate needs  foregoing larger discounts offered under elas 
we divide our license revenues into two classes virtualization platforms and other products 
virtualization platforms include our data center products and desktop virtualization products 
our data center products include a hypervisor for system partitioning the software environment from its underlying infrastructure 
table of contents and products that enable the aggregation of multiple servers  storage infrastructure  and networks into shared pools of resources that can be delivered dynamically  securely  and reliably to applications as needed 
desktop virtualization products decouple the entire desktop environment from its underlying device  enabling customers to create user centric instead of device centric desktop environments 
the other product category includes solutions  such as tc server and hyperic hq  that help organizations build  run  and manage enterprise applications  particularly those written in the java programming language 
revenues from virtualization platforms were   and  in   and  respectively 
as a percentage of license revenues  revenues from virtualization platforms were   and in   and  respectively 
revenues from other products were insignificant in there were no revenues from other products in  and  respectively 
while we have recently seen continued incremental improvement in the general economic environment  we believe that our customers may continue to exercise caution with regard to it spending during as a result  we continue to plan conservatively for services revenues services revenues were in  in  and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in the increases in services revenues during and were primarily attributable to growth in our software maintenance revenues 
we expect that services revenues will continue to compose an incrementally larger proportion of our revenue mix for the foreseeable future 
software maintenance revenues were in  in  and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in in  services revenues benefited from strong renewals  multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods  and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with software licenses 
in addition  the growth in services revenues year over year increased as a result of customers becoming current on their maintenance agreements in order to receive vsphere as part of those arrangements 
in  the growth reflected the increase in our license revenues  as software maintenance services are generally purchased with licenses  the benefit from multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods  and renewals of existing customer software maintenance contracts 
professional services revenues were in  in  and in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in in  revenues increased due to growing demand for design and implementation services  as well as redemption of consulting and training credits purchased by customers in connection with elas and as part of vsphere license and consulting bundles for new users of our products 
in  revenues increased due to growing demand for design and implementation services and training programs  as end user organizations deployed virtualization across their organizations 
although we continue to serve our customers directly  since the end of our strategy has been to encourage our partners to build their professional services businesses around us  which we believe will leverage our license sales through this channel 
as a result of this strategy  our professional services revenue can vary based on the delivery channels used in any given period as well as the timing of engagements 

table of contents operating expenses information about our operating expenses is as follows for the year ended december  operating expenses cost of license revenues cost of services revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income percentage of revenues cost of license revenues cost of services revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating margin in evaluating our results  we focus on operating margin excluding stock based compensation  employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets  the write off of in process research and development  acquisition related items  and the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs as we believe this measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
operating margins decreased from in to in and from in to in  primarily related to stock based compensation and capitalized software development costs  as opposed to any structural changes in how we manage or invest in our business 
these items are shown in the table below 
for the year ended december  cost of license revenues stock based compensation intangible amortization capitalized software development costs amortization cost of services revenues stock based compensation employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions intangible amortization research and development stock based compensation not capitalized employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions intangible amortization in process research and development total capitalized software development costs stock based compensation included in total capitalized software development costs above sales and marketing stock based compensation employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions intangible amortization general and administrative stock based compensation employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions intangible amortization acquisition related costs and other 
table of contents stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  stock based compensation  excluding amounts capitalized stock based compensation capitalized stock based compensation  including amounts capitalized stock based compensation expense increased between and primarily due to restricted stock unit grants made in september to certain international employees who were not eligible to participate in the exchange offer and to various other employees for retention purposes 
these awards were subject to a full year of vesting and expense recognition in additionally  stock based compensation expense increased due to refresh awards made to our existing employees in the second quarter of and equity awards issued in connection with the acquisition of springsource in the third quarter of stock based compensation expenses increased between and primarily due to broad based stock option and restricted stock unit grants made under the vmware equity and incentive plan beginning in the second quarter of beginning in june  we granted equity incentive awards under our equity and incentive plan in anticipation of our ipo 
stock based compensation is recorded to each operating expense category based upon the function of the employee to whom the stock based compensation relates 
historically  stock based compensation by operating expense category has fluctuated based upon the value and number of awards granted to employees in each respective function 
the r d function has historically had the greatest amount of stock based compensation given the size of our r d organization and the strategic role that its employees serve within the company 
in addition  our acquisitions have primarily been technology focused  and many of the equity awards related to employees acquired were in our r d organization 
conversely  the compensation for the sales organization is more heavily weighted toward cash compensation  primarily in the form of commissions  and therefore has disproportionally lower stock based compensation expense 
as of december   the total unamortized fair value of our outstanding equity based awards and emc equity based awards held by our employees was approximately this amount will be recognized over the awards requisite service periods  and is expected to result in stock based compensation expense of approximately    and for    and  respectively 
in future quarters  our total stock based compensation expense is expected to increase as a result of the grants described above and any additional equity grants we make 
stock based compensation expense is subject to the amount of stock based compensation that may be capitalized for the development of new software products and the amount of awards that are forfeited 
capitalized software development costs  net capitalization of material development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when the products technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established  and our amounts capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when technological feasibility has been reached or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
in   and  we capitalized including of stock based compensation  including of stock based compensation  and including of stock based compensation  respectively  of costs incurred for the development of software products 
these amounts have been excluded 
table of contents from r d expense on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in capitalized software development costs in as compared with was primarily the result of the reduced costs capitalized on vmware vsphere 
most of the vsphere costs were capitalized during the second half of in   and  amortization expense from capitalized amounts was   and  respectively 
these amounts are included in cost of license revenues on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we amortized more costs during compared with primarily due to the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of we amortized more costs during compared with primarily due to the overall timing of when products became generally available 
intangible amortization other intangible amortization and the other remaining expenses shown in the table above were in  in  and in  representing a decrease of or in and an increase of or in the decrease in these expenses between and was primarily due to the lack of expensed in process research and development in and intangible amortization ceasing on historical acquisitions offset in part by additional amortization for new acquisitions 
the increase in these expenses between and was primarily due to in process research and development recognized in  an increase in employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions  and intangible amortization ceasing on historical acquisitions offset in part by additional amortization for new acquisitions 
operating expenses aside from the effects of  and changes relating to  stock based compensation  employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets  the write off of in process research and development  acquisition related items  and the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs  the following discussion highlights the remaining factors that impacted our operating expenses 
after taking into consideration the items in the table and discussed above  the increase between and was or in and or in the increase between and was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expenses from incremental headcount added to support the business and our international expansion  as well as a result of higher commission expense from increased sales volumes 
these increases were partially offset by the benefit from the austerity measures we introduced at the end of these austerity measures included  but were not limited to  reduced travel and entertainment costs  decreased contractor costs  and hiring limited to roles that fit our strategic initiatives 
these measures also included suspensions of merit increases for our employees and our company match of pre tax employee contributions to k retirement plans 
in the fourth quarter of  we reinstated contributions to the k retirement plans  subject to maximum limits  and we have budgeted for a merit increase effective in the second quarter of the purpose of our austerity measures has been to enable us to maintain reasonable margins and preserve cash while at the same time execute on our core initiatives and deliver value to our customers 
the increase between and was primarily as a result of higher salaries and benefits expenses from incremental headcount added to support the business  and to support feature functionality development  sustainment of existing products and new product development 
additionally  the increase was due to commission expense on higher sales volumes  as well as increased marketing expenses relating to our ongoing international market expansion and our branding initiative in a portion of our operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  marketing  and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  and are thus exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses benefited by in and were negatively impacted by in due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies as compared with the respective prior year 

table of contents cost of license revenues after taking into consideration the items in the table and discussed above  the increase was or in and or in the increase between and was primarily due to additional royalty costs in connection with products licensed from third party providers 
the change between and was relatively minor 
cost of services revenues after considering the effect of the items in the table and discussed above  the increase was or in and or in the increase between and was primarily due to an increase in incremental costs associated with the increased services revenues  as well as incremental headcount to support the services function 
in addition  certain employee related costs increased as we recognized expenses related to relocating certain positions to lower cost locations 
these increases were partially offset by certain costs that were previously categorized as cost of services revenues that are now recorded in other operating expense categories on our consolidated statement of income 
the increase between and was primarily due to increased direct support  professional services personnel and third party professional services costs to support the increased services revenues 
research and development expenses after considering the effect of the items in the table and discussed above  the increase was or in and or in the change between and was relatively minor primarily due to increased salaries and benefits expenses resulting from incremental headcount from strategic hiring  offset by decreased costs resulting from the austerity measures we implemented in the fourth quarter of the increase between and was primarily due to increased facilities  salaries and benefits expenses resulting from incremental headcount added in support of feature functionality development  sustainment of existing products  and new product development  which are intended to grow our future business 
sales and marketing expenses after considering the effect of the items in the table and discussed above  the increase was or in and or in the increase between and consisted primarily of higher commission expense  increased salaries and benefits expenses resulting from increased sales volumes and incremental headcount added in conjunction with our international expansion  as well as increased spending to enhance the sales and marketing systems infrastructure of our business 
these cost increases were partially offset by the benefit we received from the movement of the us dollar  decreased travel and entertainment costs resulting from the austerity measures we implemented in the fourth quarter of  and decreased marketing program expenses as compared with our branding initiative in the increase between and consisted primarily of higher salaries and benefits expenses due to increases in sales and marketing personnel and higher commission expense resulting from increased sales volumes 
the increase was also due to marketing expenses related to our ongoing international market expansion and marketing expenses related to our branding initiative in a portion of our sales and marketing expenses is denominated in foreign currencies and thus exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as exchange rates vary  the amount of sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate in response to changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the expenses are payable 
general and administrative expenses after considering the effect of the items in the table and discussed above  the increase was or in and or in the increase between and was primarily as a result of increased salaries and benefits expenses resulting from additional personnel employed to enhance the infrastructure of our 
table of contents business and to expand our own administrative functions 
in addition  certain employee related costs increased as we recognized expenses related to relocating certain positions to lower cost locations 
these cost increases were partially offset by decreased other general and administrative costs  including legal expenses 
the increase between and was primarily as a result of additional salaries and benefits expenses resulting from the additional resources to support the growth of our business and to expand our own administrative functions 
investment income investment income was   and in   and  respectively 
investment income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
investment income decreased in compared with primarily due to a decrease in the average rate of interest earned 
the decrease in the average rate of interest earned primarily relates to a decrease in federal reserve rates in response to the macroeconomic environment 
investment income increased in compared with due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances  primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities  as well as a full year of interest earned on proceeds we received in the middle of the third quarter of from our ipo and the sale of shares of our class a common stock to intel capital 
the increase in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances was partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest rates in interest expense with emc  net interest expense with emc  net  was in  in  and in in  and  interest expense with emc  net  consisted primarily of   and  respectively  of interest expense incurred on the note issued to emc in april  net of interest income earned or incurred on intercompany balances 
the decreases in interest expense in and were due to lower interest rates on the note 
for  and  the weighted average rate was   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in was additionally due to a repayment of of the principal balance in august of as a result of a lower day libor rate as compared with the fourth quarter of  we expect our interest expense on the note payable to decrease in the first quarter of the interest rate on the note payable resets quarterly and is determined using the day libor rate plus basis points  two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was income of in and expense of in in  other expense  net was not material 
other income  net increased in compared with primarily due to a gain of from the mark to market of a previously held equity interest in springsource to fair value in connection with the acquisition of springsource in the third quarter of  partially offset by losses on foreign currency transactions 
other expense  net was higher in compared with primarily due to foreign currency revaluations 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for was as compared with for and for the higher effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to an increase in unrecognized tax positions relative to income before tax  offset by the increase in the favorable impact of tax credits relative to income before tax 
the slight decrease in the effective rate to in from in was mainly attributable to a net benefit resulting from an increase in tax credits 
the tax rate is expected to be higher than the fiscal year tax rate primarily due to a forecasted shift of earnings from low tax non us jurisdictions to the united states and the expiration of the federal r d credit at december   offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax positions relative to income before income tax 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year is based upon the income for the year  the composition of the income in different countries  and adjustments  if any  for the potential tax consequences  benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies 
our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the united states 

table of contents we have been included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and expect to continue to be included in such consolidated group for periods in which emc owns at least of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock 
each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon 
should emc s ownership fall below of the total voting power or value of our outstanding stock in any period  then we would no longer be included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and thus no longer be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred  but not discharged  by any other member of the emc consolidated group 
additionally  our us federal income tax would be reported separately from that of the emc consolidated group 
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations  changes in our international organization  shifts in the amount of income before tax earned in the us as compared with other regions in the world  and changes in overall levels of income before tax

table of contents our operating activities for each year in the three years ended december  have generated sufficient cash to meet our operating needs 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  compared with  as of december  during the year ended december   key drivers in the overall increase of cash was the generation of of cash from operating activities and in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options  partially offset by the acquisition of springsource for and additions to capital expenditures of historically  we have invested excess cash predominantly in money market securities that are liquid and of high quality investment grade 
the fair value for money market securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date 
we limit the amount of our domestic and international investments with any one issuer and also monitor the diversity of the portfolio  thereby diversifying the credit risk 
as of december   we held a diversified portfolio of money market funds  which invest in municipal bonds and notes  government agency debt  corporate bonds  and commercial paper 
the temporary guarantee program for money market funds expired on september   and as such  our investments in certain money market funds no longer have a guarantee backed by the us treasury 
as of december    or of our cash and cash equivalents balance was invested in money market securities 
of our money market portfolio  of our money market securities were held domestically and were held internationally 
in addition to investments in money market securities  we also use excess cash to support our growing infrastructure needs  to expand our operations  and as consideration for acquisitions and strategic investments 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in  and to use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  and other adjustments 
the year ended december  was positively impacted by the collection of of the income tax receivable from emc 
the receivable was due to our stand alone taxable loss for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to tax deductions arising from both non qualified stock option exercises and from restricted stock where the restrictions lapsed 
under the tax sharing agreement with emc  emc is obligated to pay us an amount equal to the tax benefit that emc will recognize on its tax return 
in  the receipt was offset by the payment of for our portion of emc s consolidated federal and state income taxes for various periods  as well as the and federal income tax audit 
in and  cash flows from operating activities were negatively impacted by the payment of and  respectively  for our portion of emc s consolidated federal income taxes 
cash provided by operations in the years ended december    and benefited from increasing sales in each period 
as a result  our deferred revenue balance increased which had a positive impact on operating cash flows 
the increase in our deferred revenue balance was largely driven by increases in deferred maintenance revenue for which we are typically paid in advance 
in each annual period  the increases to deferred revenues were partially offset by an increase in our accounts receivable 
as a result of the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of  capitalized software development costs decreased compared with  thereby shifting the related cash flows from investing cash flows to operating cash flows as compared with 
table of contents cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to business acquisitions  capital expenditures  capitalized software development costs  and the purchase of investments 
we invested for an acquisition in  compared with for acquisitions in and for acquisitions in the increase in business acquisitions in as compared with relates to our acquisition of springsource in the third quarter of acquisitions are an important element in our industry and we expect to continue to consider investing in strategic acquisitions in the future 
our capital expenditures totaled   and in   and  respectively 
in  our capital expenditures primarily related to the completion of construction on our headquarters facility and completion of portions of our washington data center facility and related equipment  as well as software development and computer and network equipment to support increased personnel and related infrastructure requirements 
in  our capital expenditures primarily related to the construction of our headquarters facility and our data center  as well as investments in computer and network equipment to support increased personnel and related infrastructure requirements both domestically and internationally 
no further capital expenditures are expected related to the construction of our headquarters facility as this project was completed in early capital expenditures in were primarily due to our investment in our new headquarters facility 
we purchased from emc buildings already under construction for  which was the cost expended by emc during construction 
we also purchased furniture and fixtures for the new facilities and invested cash in the remaining buildings under development 
in addition to the investment in our headquarters facilities in  we purchased computer and network equipment to support increased personnel and related infrastructure requirements 
our capitalized software development costs  excluding stock based compensation expense  totaled   and in   and  respectively 
the decrease in capitalized software development costs in as compared with was primarily the result of the reduced costs capitalized on vmware vsphere 
most of the vsphere costs were capitalized during the second half of as a result  after the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of  the related cash flows shifted from investing cash flows to operating cash flows as compared with the increase in capitalized software development costs in as compared with was the result of the deployment of additional resources to support the development of software products  including vmware vsphere  as well as the timing of when products reached technological feasibility 
our purchase of investments totaled in and in we did not purchase investments in cash flows from financing activities in and  we received proceeds of and  respectively  from the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the vmware employee stock purchase plan espp 
between the time of our acquisition by emc in january and june  we did not issue equity awards in our stock to our employees 
during this period  employees received stock based compensation in the form of emc stock options and restricted stock awards and units as a result of grants made by emc s board of directors 
beginning in june  we granted equity incentive awards under our equity and incentive plan in anticipation of our ipo 
as such  we had of financing activities in related to the exercise of options 
additionally  the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation was in and in these amounts are shown as a reduction to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from financing activities 
these changes year over year in the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation were primarily due to the decline in the market value of our stock and the number of awards exercised  sold  or 
table of contents vested 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of in and in to repurchase our shares to cover tax withholding obligations in conjunction with the net share settlement upon the vesting of restricted stock 
we had no excess tax benefit from stock based compensation  as well as no cash outflows to repurchase our shares to cover tax withholding obligations in in  as a result of the completion of our ipo  we received net proceeds of  from issuance of our class a common stock 
we also received net proceeds of from the sale of our class a common stock to intel capital in we used a portion of these proceeds to pay of principal on the intercompany note payable owed to emc 
future cash proceeds from issuances of common stock and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and future cash outflows to repurchase our shares to cover tax withholding obligations will depend upon  and could fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the market value of our stock  the number of awards exercised  sold or vested  the tax benefit realized  and the tax affected compensation recognized 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  defines and prescribes the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non gaap financial measure 
we define non gaap operating cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less capitalized software development costs plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
we define free cash flows as non gaap operating cash flows less capital expenditures 
vmware s management uses non gaap operating cash flows as a measure of cash flows from operations because this measure offers a perspective of vmware s operating cash flows that aligns with how management internally views our overall and individual functional group operating results 
when viewing operating results for evaluating our past performance and for planning purposes  management excludes certain items  including the effect of capitalizing and amortizing software development costs and items related to stock based compensation  which are also excluded in the non gaap operating cash flows measure 
vmware s management uses free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business  as it balances operating results  cash management  and capital efficiency 
we believe that our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows provide useful information to investors and others  as they allow for meaningful period to period comparisons of our operating cash flows for analysis of trends in our business 
additionally  we believe that information regarding non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on cash that we may choose to make available for strategic acquisitions and investments  the repurchase of shares  ongoing operations  and other capital expenditures 
we deduct capitalization of software development costs from both measures because these costs are considered to be a necessary component of our ongoing operations and the amount capitalized under generally accepted accounting principles gaap can vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
consequently  software development costs paid out during a period that are capitalized under gaap and do not impact gaap operating cash flows for that period do result in a decrease to our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and non gaap free cash flows  thereby providing management with useful measures of cash flows generated from operations during the period 
we add back the excess income tax benefits from stock based compensation to our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows as management internally views cash flows arising from income taxes as similar to operating cash flows rather than as financing cash flows as required under gaap 
furthermore  we exclude capital expenditures on property and equipment from free cash flows because these expenditures are also considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations 

table of contents a limitation of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows is that they do not have a uniform definition 
our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies  including peer companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
thus  our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or in isolation from  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
the following is a reconciliation of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows to the most comparable gaap measure  net cash provided by operating activities  for   and for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities capitalized software development costs excess tax benefits from stock based compensation non gaap operating cash flows capital expenditures free cash flows off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  customers  distributors  resellers  x system vendors  and systems integrators 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret  and or other intellectual property right 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury  or the acts or omissions by us and our employees  agents  or representatives 
we have agreements with certain vendors  financial institutions  lessors  and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters  such as acts and omissions by us and our employees  agents  or representatives 
we have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that we have obtained the right to use in our products and agreements 
under some of these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors and executive officers  to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer 
our by laws and charter also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer 
we also indemnify certain employees who provide service with respect to employee benefits plans  including the members of the vmware k savings plan committee 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the former directors and officers of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company s by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons 
we typically purchase a tail directors and officers insurance policy  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification obligations related to the former officers and directors of an acquired company 

table of contents it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years note payable to emc operating leases uncertain tax positions other agreements total includes payments from january  through december  includes payments from january  through december  the note is due and payable in full on april   however  we can pay down the note at an earlier date in full or in part at our election 
our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world 
as of december   we had of non current net unrecognized tax benefits under generally accepted accounting guidance 
we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
consisting of various contractual agreements  which include commitments on the lease for our washington data center facility 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the critical accounting policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other significant accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock options generally accepted accounting principles require recognizing compensation costs for all share based payment awards made to employees based upon the awards estimated grant date fair value 
we elected to estimate the fair value of employee stock option awards and options under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of our share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our 
table of contents stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate associated with the expected term of the awards  expected dividends and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period the estimates are revised 
should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  this could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the licensing of software and related services 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we recognize license revenues from the sale of software when risk of loss transfers  which is generally upon electronic shipment 
we primarily license our software under perpetual licenses through our channel of distributors  resellers  x system vendors  systems integrators and our direct sales force 
we defer revenues relating to products that have shipped into our channel until our products are sold through the channel 
we estimate and record reserves for products that are not sold through the channel based on historical trends and relevant current information 
we obtain sell through information from distributors and certain resellers on a monthly basis and reconcile any estimates  if necessary  made in the previous month 
historically  actual information has not differed materially from the related estimate 
for our channel partners who do not report sell through data  we determine sell through based on payment of such distributors and certain resellers accounts receivable balances and other relevant factors 
for software sold by x system vendors that is bundled with their hardware  unless we have a separate license agreement with the end user  revenue is recognized in arrears upon the receipt of binding royalty reports 
the accuracy of our reserves depends on our ability to estimate the product sold through the channels and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we offer rebates to certain channel partners  which are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related product sale is recognized 
when rebates are based on the set percentage of actual sales  we recognize the costs of the rebates as a reduction of revenue when the underlying revenue is recognized 
in cases where rebates are earned if a cumulative level of sales is achieved  we recognize the cost of the rebates as a reduction of revenue proportionally for each sale that is required to achieve the target 
the estimated reserves for channel rebates and sales incentives are based on channel partners actual performance against the terms and conditions of the programs  historical trends and the value of the rebates 
the accuracy of these reserves for these rebates and sales incentives depends on our ability to estimate these items and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
with the exception of one of our desktop products  our return policy does not allow end users to return products for a refund 
certain distributors and resellers may rotate stock when new versions of a product are released 
we estimate future product returns at the time of sale 
our estimate is based on historical return rates  levels of inventory held by distributors and resellers and other relevant factors 
the accuracy of these reserves depends on our ability to estimate sales returns and stock rotation among other criteria 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
returns have not been material to date and have been in line with our expectations 

table of contents our services revenues consist of software maintenance and professional services 
we recognize software maintenance revenues ratably over the contract period 
typically  our contract periods range from one to five years 
professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products because services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours and direct expenses incurred 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based upon hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments regarding our services revenues  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
our software products are typically sold with software maintenance services 
vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts or the stated renewal rate for software maintenance included in the license agreement 
our software products may also be sold with professional services 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
customers under software maintenance agreements are entitled to receive updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis  and various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
in the event specific features or functionalities  entitlements or the release number of an upgrade or new product have been announced but not delivered  and customers will receive that upgrade or new product as part of a current software maintenance contract  a specified upgrade is deemed created and product revenues are deferred on purchases made after the announcement date until delivery of the upgrade or new product 
the amount and elements to be deferred are dependent on whether the company has established vsoe of fair value for the upgrade or new product 
vsoe of fair value of these upgrades or new products is established based upon the price set by management 
we have a history of selling such upgrades or new products on a stand alone basis 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent with the sale of these elements on a stand alone basis 
this determination could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
capitalized software development costs costs related to r d are generally charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization of material development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
changes in judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  would likely materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability declines in the future  the amount of costs capitalized would likely decrease 
in addition  our r d expenses and amounts capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when technological feasibility has been reached or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
generally accepted accounting principles require annual amortization expense of capitalized software development costs to be the greater of the amounts computed using the ratio of current gross revenue to a product s total current and anticipated revenues  or the straight line method over the product s remaining estimated economic life 
to date  we amortized these costs using the straight line method as it is the greater of the two amounts 
the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to 
table of contents certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
material differences in amortization amounts could occur as a result of changes in the periods over which we actually generate revenues or the amounts of revenues generated 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  other intangible assets  and goodwill 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt expense could exceed our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period during which the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
our goodwill is assessed for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the assessment is performed by comparing the market value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  management judgment is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we do not provide for a us income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the earnings of non us subsidiaries  which reflect full provision for non us income taxes  are indefinitely reinvested in non us operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax 
income taxes are calculated on a separate tax return basis  although we are included in the consolidated tax return of emc 
the difference between the income taxes payable that is calculated on a separate return basis and the amount actually paid to emc pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with emc is presented as a component of additional paid in capital 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 which amends revenue recognition guidance related to revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
we have determined that this accounting guidance is not applicable to our business and will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amends the accounting guidance related to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the new guidance amends the scope of software revenue recognition guidance to exclude tangible products that include software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
this guidance shall be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have determined that this accounting guidance is not applicable to our business and will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards codification no

this revision is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we operate in foreign countries which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in historically  our revenue contracts were primarily denominated in us dollars 
with the general release of vmware vsphere in may of  we began to invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen  and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
the majority of our purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars 
however  a portion of our operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  sales and sales support  and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound  the indian rupee  and the australian dollar 
revenues resulting from selling in local currencies  and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income 
as exchange rates vary  operating margins may differ materially from expectations 
operating expenses benefited by million in  and were negatively impacted by million in  respectively  due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies as compared to the prior year period 
based upon planned spending in  if the dollar weakened by in in relation to the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the indian rupee  and the japanese yen  this would result in additional expense of approximately million 
there are no meaningful comparisons to prior periods of the effects on our revenues from fluctuations in exchange rates as we were not selling in local currencies in comparable periods 
in july  we initiated a program to manage our exposure to certain foreign currency fluctuations by entering into economic foreign currency hedges related to a portion of our net outstanding monetary asset and liability positions 
the gains and losses on our foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the majority of 
table of contents the gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that we hedge  and are reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into speculative foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
our foreign currency forward contracts are generally traded on a monthly basis with a contractual term of one month 
as of december   we had outstanding forward contracts with a total notional value of million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was immaterial as of december  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts of million as of december  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk as of december   million was outstanding on the consolidated balance sheet in relation to the note payable with emc 
the interest rate on the note payable as of december    and was   and  respectively 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the variable interest obligation on the million outstanding on the consolidated balance sheet in relation to the note payable to emc 
the note may be repaid  without penalty  at any time 
the note matures in april and bears an interest rate of the day libor plus basis points  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest rate on the note resets quarterly and is determined on the two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
as a result of a lower day libor rate  we expect our interest expense on the note payable to decrease in the first quarter of if the interest rate on the note payable were to change basis points from the december  rate and assuming no additional repayments on the principal were made  our annual interest expense would change by million
