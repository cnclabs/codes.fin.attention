item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace defense electronics and truck components assemblies 
we are organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
at december   the electronics group is comprised of sypris electronics  llc and sypris data systems  inc revenue for this group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace defense electronics 
our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace defense electronics  and truck components assemblies 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback  which is deemed uncollectible 
investments in marketable securities 
our investment in marketable securities was comprised exclusively of shares in dhc common stock 
we accounted for our investments in equity securities under asc formerly sfas no 

marketable securities were classified as available for sale securities and measured at fair value as determined by a quoted market price 
unrealized holding gains and losses were excluded from earnings and reported net of the related tax effect in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
management evaluated its marketable securities for other than temporary impairment when the fair value of 
table of contents an investment declined below its original cost 
factors that were considered in the evaluation for other than temporary impairment include  among other things  the duration and extent of the decline  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  credit risk and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market 
if a decline in fair value was judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security was written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down was included in earnings 
the new cost basis was not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
the company assesses recoverability using several methodologies  including a discounted cash flow analysis and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of capital specific to the reporting unit 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit and is added to the present value of the forecasted cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting unit s cash flow is projected to grow beyond the period covered by the long range plan 
the cash flow analysis requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculation 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the sum of the calculated fair values of each reporting unit is then reconciled and compared to our total market capitalization  allowing for a reasonable control premium 
if the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit s carrying value  we proceed to step two of the impairment process 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
after performing our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our industrial group  as the carrying value of this reporting unit significantly exceeded its fair value 
the impairment charge reflected the full impairment of the goodwill of the industrial group and was driven by the reporting unit s performance and current economic conditions 
the industrial group reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  and was projecting an operating loss in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
there were no indicators of impairment for the electronics group  which is the only remaining reporting unit with goodwill 
while revenue for this reporting unit fell year over year  profit margins improved to significantly offset the impact of the net revenue decline 
the fair value for the electronics group exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our electronics group during the fourth quarter were the expected after tax cash flows for the period from to  a terminal growth rate of and a weighted average cost of capital of 
the terminal rate is consistent with the prior year growth rate of 
our analysis included a comparison of our market capitalization to the fair value of the entire enterprise 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair values of each of our reporting units were reasonable 
however  different assumptions could materially affect the results 
net revenue and cost of sales net revenue of products and services under commercial terms and conditions are recorded upon delivery and passage of title  or when services are rendered 
related shipping and handling costs  if any  are included in costs of sales 
net revenue under service type contracts is recorded as costs are incurred 
net revenue under long term  fixed price contracts with aerospace defense companies and agencies of the us government is recognized upon shipment 
estimated contract profits are taken into earnings based on actual cost of sales for units shipped 
prior to a system conversion in  estimated contract profits were recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
the change to recognizing costs on an actual basis from an estimated basis did not have a material impact to our financial statements and result of operations 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue when such costs are invoiced to the customer 

table of contents long lived asset impairment 
we perform periodic impairment analysis on our long lived amortizable assets whenever events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when indicators are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to their carrying amount 
if the operations are determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of their assets  the long lived assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment test  principally in determining whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review 
within the industrial group  we recorded impairment charges of million in and million in while we believe our judgments and assumptions were reasonable  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
pension plan funded status 
the calculation of pension assets and liabilities involve complex estimation processes dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries 
the assumptions used  including discount rates and return on plan assets  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
changes in these rates could significantly impact the actuarially determined amounts recorded in the statements of financial position 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve is based on a subset of these fixed income investments 
the projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value is developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plan s investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation  and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over future periods 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory 
we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market  and we reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions using the black scholes option pricing method  which requires the input of several subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based compensation and consequently  the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes as required by the provisions of asc  income taxes formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
in addition  under asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of uncertain income tax positions 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded income tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  asc requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is largely dependent upon projected near term profitability including the effects of tax planning 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct our operations or otherwise incur taxable income or losses 
we have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and mexico where realization has been determined to be uncertain 
however  our mexican operation  which has historically generated taxable income and expects to continue to be profitable for the foreseeable future  also has certain deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded against such assets as of december  since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowance may be necessary 
results of operations the table presented below  which compares our consolidated results of operations from one year to another  presents the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue 
the first two data columns in the table show the absolute results for each year presented 
the columns entitled year over year change and year over year percentage change show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net revenue increases from one year to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one year to the next  that change is shown as a negative number in both columns 
the last two columns in the table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenue 
in these two columns  the cost of sales and gross profit for each are given as a percentage of that segment s net revenue 
these amounts are shown in italics

the industrial group derives its revenue from manufacturing services and product sales 
net revenue in the industrial group decreased million to million in depressed market conditions for heavy and light trucks have contributed to volume related reductions in net revenue of approximately million 
volume declines for trailer axles resulted in a net revenue reduction from the prior year 
revenue also declined million due to the discontinued sale of axle shafts to a light truck customer and million in lower sales of our specialty closure products 
further  contractual settlements and price reductions resulted in a million decrease in net revenue from partially offsetting the volume change was an increase in steel prices  which is contractually passed through to customers under certain contracts  resulting in an increase in net revenue of million 
the electronics group derives its revenue from product sales and technical outsourced services 
net revenue in the electronics group increased million to million 
net revenue increased primarily as a result of shipments of new electronic circuit card assemblies for the bradley combat system 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in sales of certain data recording products and a reduction in encryption products 

table of contents gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit decreased million to a loss of million in the significant decrease in sales volume  combined with higher utility rates  resulted in a reduction in gross profit of approximately million 
the industrial group also realized a decline in gross profit of million in as a result of lower revenue from contractual settlements and pricing as compared to the prior year 
the decreases in gross profit were partially offset by productivity improvements attributable to restructuring activities of approximately million and favorable exchange rates experienced during the year 
the electronics group s gross profit increased million to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for increased to from in the increase in gross profit for the segment in was primarily due to the redesign of a secured communication product  changes in the product mix and significant productivity improvements made during the year 
the productivity improvements were due  in large part  to the various restructuring initiatives began in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million in primarily due to reductions in compensation and employee benefit costs 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased million in primarily due the completion of development efforts for a next generation secured communications device within our electronics group 
restructuring expense  net 
in december  we announced a restructuring program  which included the closure of the industrial group s kenton  ohio facility  the significant reduction in volumes at the marion  ohio facility which remains under consideration for potential closure depending upon the cost of moving certain equipment  the need for continuing capacity  the possibility of new business opportunities and overall market conditions and the consolidation of sypris electronics and sypris data systems into a single operation within the electronics group 
additionally  we have exited several programs within the electronics group 
the purpose of the restructuring program is to reduce fixed costs  accelerate integration efficiencies  and significantly improve operating earnings on a sustained basis 
the restructuring activities are expected to result in million in annual savings under normal market conditions 
the activities generating the expected savings are from the following i annual savings of million from completed or potential facility closings  ii annual savings of million from operational efficiencies  iii annual savings of million from product costing changes implemented during the first quarter of  and iv annual savings of million from various quality improvement initiatives implemented during as a result of these initiatives  we recorded  or expect to record in future periods  aggregate pre tax expenses of approximately million  consisting of the following million in severance and benefit costs  million in non cash asset impairments  million in non cash deferred contract costs write offs  million in inventory related charges  million in equipment relocation costs  million in asset retirement obligations  million in contract termination costs and million in other restructuring charges 
of the aggregate million in pre tax costs  we expect million will be cash expenditures  the majority of which has been spent at december  the cash outflows related to these programs are expected to be funded from continuing operations and the existing revolving credit agreement and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
of the total program  we recorded million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  related to these initiatives during and  respectively  which is included in restructuring expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
charges for consisted of million for employee severance and benefit costs  million in deferred contract costs  million in equipment relocation costs  million in non cash asset impairments  and million in other various charges 
the additional non cash asset impairments incurred during were for assets originally expected to be redeployed to other locations but later determined to not be economically or strategically desirable to move under present conditions 
additionally  we revised our estimate for equipment relocation costs to million from the original estimate of million  as we determined it would not be economically feasible to relocate certain equipment 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional equipment relocation costs  and approximately million in other exit costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
interest expense  net 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt outstanding and an increase in interest rates resulting from the march amendments to our credit agreement and senior notes 
our weighted average debt outstanding 
table of contents increased to million during from million during  primarily as a result of operating losses related to the decline in the industrial group s revenue 
the weighted average interest rate increased to in from in additionally  the company recognized million in additional loan cost amortization over the prior year 
other income  net 
other income  net increased million  to million for from a net expense of million in  primarily due to foreign currency translation gains of million in as compared to translation losses of million in income taxes 
the income tax provision includes a benefit of million recorded due to the required intraperiod tax allocation resulting from the loss from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations 
additionally  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately million and state taxes of million related to the sale of sypris test measurement during the remaining provision recorded is associated with our foreign subsidiaries and includes minimum taxes required to be paid in mexico 
the provision includes a charge of million recorded as a valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset 
additionally  the company recorded a tax benefit of million in from the assessment of tax positions of prior years  including interest and penalties  impacted by net operating losses incurred during the year 

table of contents quarterly results the following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  we have prepared this data on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read these unaudited quarterly results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition there are several risks and uncertainties relating to the global economy and the commercial vehicle industry that could materially affect our financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
these risks and uncertainties could result in decreased sales  limited access to credit  rising costs  increased competition  customer or supplier bankruptcies  delays in customer payment terms and acceleration of supplier payments  growing inventories and failure to meet debt covenants 
as a result of a continued decline in the overall economy  we have taken significant actions during to reduce our cost base and improve profitability  including moving forward with various plant shutdowns and other workforce reductions 
based on our current forecast for  we expect to be able to meet the financial covenants of our amended credit agreements and have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations  subject to the risk factors discussed in item a of this form k 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
as disclosed elsewhere  our and operating results were significantly lower than our expectations  in part due to precipitous declines within the commercial vehicle industry 
based upon our current level of operations and our business plan  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our amended credit agreements will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
on october   the company amended its revolving credit agreement and senior notes agreements 
the loan amendment extends the maturity date of the revolving credit agreement from january  through january   while the note amendments implement the same maturity date for the senior notes 
the company used certain net proceeds from the sale of the test measurement business and of the company s holdings of dana holding corporation common stock to reduce the lending commitments under the revolving credit agreement from million to approximately million and under the senior notes from million to approximately million 
the amendments substituted new financial covenants regarding quarterly minimum net worth and liquidity levels  cumulative quarterly ebitdar levels earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and restructuring costs  cumulative quarterly fixed charge ratios and cumulative quarterly debt to ebitdar ratios  among others 
the amendments also commit the company to obtain the consent of the banks and the noteholders before making any dividend payments and impose certain fees and interest rate increases 
to the extent that marketable securities or other collateral is sold outside of the ordinary course of business  the amendments also provide for certain prepayments to the banks and the noteholders 
the company expects to be able to comply with the amended covenants 
however  no assurances can be given that changing business  regulatory or economic conditions might not cause the company to violate one or more covenants which could result in default or acceleration of any debt under the agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in  as compared to million in in  accounts receivable remained relatively flat as a result of continued emphasis on collections with significant customers and timing 
inventory decreased in and provided million primarily as a result of lower inventory levels to adjust for lower sales volumes 
other current assets decreased in and provided million primarily due to a million tax refund for our mexico operations 
accounts payable decreased and used million primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers and reduced purchases by our industrial group 
accrued liabilities decreased and used million primarily due to payments for the various restructuring accruals  including the payment of million to terminate a lease for sypris data systems and severance payments related to the shutdown of the kenton  ohio facility and certain workforce reductions at our marion  ohio facility 
net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations was million in as compared to net cash used of million in during the fourth quarter of  we sold all of the stock of sypris test 
table of contents measurement for million  of which million was deposited in an month escrow account 
excluding the escrow deposit  we received net proceeds of million after payment of sale related expenses 
additionally  we liquidated our holding of dhc common stock during the fourth quarter of for approximately million in net cash proceeds 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to net cash provided of million in  primarily due to principal paydowns to reduce the outstanding debt under the revolving credit agreements and senior notes 
additionally  we paid million in financing fees in conjunction with modifications of our debt in we had total borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million at december   and an unrestricted cash balance of million 
approximately million of the unrestricted cash balance relates to our mexican subsidiaries 
maximum borrowings on the revolving credit agreement are million 
standby letters of credit up to a maximum of million may be issued under the credit agreement of which million were issued at december  recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition
