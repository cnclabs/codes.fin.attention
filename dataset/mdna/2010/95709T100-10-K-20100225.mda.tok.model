item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other documents we file with the sec from time to time  the following factors may affect our results of operations and cash flows and the market prices of our publicly traded securities 
these factors may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
the factors listed below are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks  and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the sec 
weather conditions  including mild and severe weather  may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity 
our customers use electricity for heating in winter months and cooling in summer months 
because of air conditioning demand  typically we produce our highest revenues in the third quarter 
milder temperatures reduce demand for electricity and have a corresponding effect on our revenues 
unusually mild weather in the future could adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
in addition  severe weather conditions can produce storms that can inflict heavy damage to our equipment and facilities that can require us to incur additional operating and maintenance expense and additional capital expenditures 
our prices may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these higher costs 
additionally  because many of our power plants use water for cooling  severe drought conditions could result in limited power production 
our prices are subject to regulatory review and may not prove adequate 
we must obtain from state and federal regulators the authority to establish terms and prices for our services 
the kcc and  for most of our wholesale customers  ferc  use a cost of service approach that takes into account operating expenses  fixed obligations and recovery of and return on capital investments 
using this approach  the kcc and ferc set prices at levels calculated to recover these costs and a permitted return on investment 
except for wholesale transactions for which the price is not so regulated  and except to the extent the kcc and ferc permit us to modify our prices by using approved formulae  our prices generally remain fixed until changed following a rate review 
further  the adjustments and formulae may be modified  limited or eliminated by regulatory or legislative actions 
we may apply to change our prices or intervening parties may request that our prices be reviewed for possible adjustment 
rate proceedings through which our prices and terms of service are determined typically involve numerous parties including electricity consumers  consumer advocacy groups and governmental entities  some of whom frequently take positions adverse to us 
the decision making process used in these proceedings may or may not be subject to statutory timelines  and in any event regulators decisions may be appealed to the courts by us or other parties to the proceedings 
these factors may lead to uncertainty and delay in implementing changes to our prices or terms of service 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred 
a finding that costs have been imprudently incurred can lead to disallowance of recovery for those costs 
the rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for us to recover our costs and to provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments 
we cannot predict the outcome of any rate review or the actions of our regulators 
the ultimate outcome of rate proceedings  or delays in implementation of new prices regarding costs that we have already incurred  could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

table of contents significant decisions about capital investments are based on long term demand forecasts incorporating assumptions about multiple  uncertain factors 
our actual experience may differ significantly from our assumptions  which may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
we use long term demand forecasts to determine the timing and adequacy of our energy and energy delivery resources 
long term forecasts involve risks because they rely on assumptions we make concerning uncertain factors including weather  technological change  economic conditions  regulatory requirements  social pressures and the responsiveness of customers electricity demand to conservation measures and prices 
actual future demand depends on these and other factors and may vary from our forecasts 
if our actual experience varies significantly from our forecasts  our financial results may be adversely affected 
our ability to fund our capital expenditures and meet our working capital and liquidity needs may be limited by conditions in the bank and capital markets or by our credit ratings or the market price of westar energy s common stock 
to fund our capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity  we rely on access to capital markets and to short term credit 
disruption in capital markets  deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which we rely  any credit rating downgrade or any decrease in the market price of westar energy s common stock may make capital more difficult and costly for us to obtain  may restrict liquidity available to us  may require us to defer or limit capital investments or operating initiatives  or may reduce the value of our financial assets 
these and other related effects may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results  including our ability to pay dividends and to make investments or undertake programs necessary to meet regulatory mandates and customer demand 
our planned capital investment for the next few years is large in relation to our size  subjecting us to significant financial and operational risks 
our anticipated capital expenditures for through are approximately billion 
in addition to risks discussed above associated with recovering capital investments through our prices  and risks associated with our reliance on the capital markets and short term credit to fund those investments  our capital expenditure program poses operational risks  including shortages  disruption in the delivery of  and inconsistent quality of equipment  materials and labor  contractor or supplier non performance  delays in or failure to receive necessary permits  approvals and other regulatory authorizations  impacts of new and existing laws and regulations  including environmental laws  regulations and permit requirements  adverse weather  unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope  environmental and geological conditions  and unanticipated cost increases with respect to labor or materials  including basic commodities needed for our infrastructure such as steel  copper and aluminum 
these and other factors  or any combination of them  could cause us to defer or limit our capital expenditure program and could adversely impact our consolidated financial results 

table of contents capital market conditions can cause fluctuation in the values of assets set aside for employee benefit obligations and the wolf creek nuclear decommissioning trust and may increase our funding requirements related to these obligations 
we have significant future financial obligations with respect to employee benefit obligations and the wolf creek nuclear decommissioning trust 
the assets needed to meet those obligations are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns  which may fall below our expectations  upon which we plan to meet our obligations 
additionally  changes in interest rates affect the value of future liabilities 
while the kcc has recently allowed us to implement a regulatory accounting mechanism to track certain of our employee benefit plan expenses  this mechanism does not allow us to make automatic price adjustments 
only in future rate proceedings may we be allowed to adjust our prices to reflect changes in our funding requirements for these benefit plans 
further  the tracking mechanism for these benefit plan expenses is part of our overall rate structure  and as such it is subject to kcc review and may be modified  limited or eliminated in the future 
if these assets are not managed successfully  our consolidated financial results could be adversely affected 
adverse economic conditions could adversely impact our operations and our consolidated financial results 
our operations are affected by economic conditions  including the current recession 
adverse general economic conditions including a prolonged recession or capital market disruptions may reduce demand for our service  increase delinquencies or non payment by customers  adversely impact the financial condition of suppliers  which may in turn limit our access to inventory or capital equipment  increase deductibles and premiums and result in more restrictive policy terms under insurance policies regarding risks we typically insure against  or make insurance claims more difficult to collect  result in lower worldwide demand for coal  oil and natural gas  which may decrease fossil fuel prices and put downward pressure on electricity prices  and reduce the credit available to our energy trading counterparties and correspondingly reduce our energy trading activity or increase our exposure to counterparty default 
any of these events  and others we may not be able to identify  could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
deliveries of fuel for our plants may be interrupted or slowed  which may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
we purchase fuel  including coal  natural gas and uranium  from a number of suppliers 
disruption in the delivery of fuel or environmental regulations affecting any of our fuel suppliers could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
in addition  the supply markets for coal  natural gas and uranium are subject to price fluctuations  availability restrictions and counterparty default 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate cost or availability of these commodities 
such costs  if not recovered in the prices we are allowed to charge  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
we are subject to complex governmental regulation that could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies 
we must also comply with environmental legislation and associated regulations 
new laws or regulations  the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations  or penalties imposed for non compliance with existing laws or regulations may require us to incur additional expenses 

table of contents our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  and health and safety 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital and operating resources toward permitting  emission fees  environmental monitoring  installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchases of air emission allowances and or offsets 
we emit large amounts of co 

and other gasses through the operation of our power plants 
existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to ghgs may be adopted and may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our generating facilities or increased compliance costs 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  if not recovered in the prices we are allowed to charge  could adversely affect our consolidated financial results  especially if emission and or discharge limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increases 
we cannot estimate our compliance costs with certainty due to our inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of any new environmental rule or regulation related to emissions 
our risk management policies cannot eliminate price volatility and counterparty credit risks associated with our energy marketing activities 
we engage in energy marketing transactions with the goal of managing our commodity price risk  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we operate in active wholesale markets that expose us to price volatility for electricity and fuel and other commodities 
the prices we use to value these transactions reflect our best estimates of the fair value of these contracts 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could cause significant earnings variability 
in addition  we are exposed to credit risks of our counterparties and the risk that one or more counterparties may fail to perform their obligations to make payments or deliveries 
defaults by suppliers or other counterparties may adversely affect our consolidated financial results 
we attempt to manage our exposure to price volatility and counterparty credit risk through application of established risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities 
we are exposed to various risks associated with the ownership and operation of wolf creek  any of which could adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
through kge s ownership of an interest in wolf creek  we are subject to the risks of nuclear generation  which include the risks associated with storing  handling and disposing of radioactive materials and the current lack of a long term disposal solution for radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations  uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning wolf creek at the end of its life  and costs of measures associated with public safety 

table of contents the nrc has authority to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has authority to impose fines or shut down a unit  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
revised safety requirements enacted by the nrc could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at wolf creek 
in addition  the institute of nuclear power operations inpo reviews wolf creek operations and facilities 
compliance with inpo recommendations could result in substantial capital expenditures or a substantial increase in operating expenses at wolf creek being passed through to kge 
if an incident did occur at wolf creek  it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
furthermore  the non compliance of other nuclear facilities operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident at other facilities could result in increased regulation of the industry as a whole  which could in turn increase wolf creek s compliance costs and impact our consolidated financial results 
in addition  in the event of an extended or unscheduled outage at wolf creek  we would be required to generate power from more costly generating units  purchase power in the open market to replace the power normally produced at wolf creek and have less power available for sale into the wholesale markets 
if we were unable to recover these costs from customers  such events would likely have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
events could occur that would change the accounting principles for regulated utilities currently applicable to our business  which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
we currently apply accounting principles that are unique to regulated entities 
as of december   we had recorded million of regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities 
in the event we determined that we could no longer apply these principles  either as i a result of the establishment of retail competition in our service territory  ii a change in the regulatory approach for setting rates from cost based ratemaking to another form of ratemaking  iii a result of other regulatory actions that restrict cost recovery to a level insufficient to recover costs  or iv a change from current generally accepted accounting principles gaap to another set of standards that does not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities  we would be required to record a charge against income in the amount of the remaining unamortized net regulatory assets 
such an action would materially reduce our shareholders equity 
we review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of these principles is appropriate each reporting period 
based upon our most current evaluation of the various factors that are expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe that our regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
equipment failures and other events beyond our control may cause extended or unplanned plant outages  which may adversely impact our consolidated financial results 
the generation and transmission of electricity requires the use of expensive and complicated equipment  much of which is aged  and all of which requires significant ongoing maintenance 
although we have a maintenance program in place  our power plants and equipment are subject to extended or unplanned outages because of equipment failure  weather  transmission system disruption  operator error  contractor or subcontractor failure and other factors largely beyond our control 
in such events  we must either produce replacement power for our other units  which may be less efficient or more expensive to operate  or purchase power from others at unpredictable and potentially higher costs in order to meet our sales obligations 
such events could also limit our ability to make sales to customers 
therefore  the occurrence of extended or unplanned outages could adversely affect our consolidated financial results

executive summary overview we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately  customers in kansas under the regulation of the kcc 
we also provide electric energy at wholesale to the electric distribution systems of cities and four electric cooperatives in kansas under the regulation of ferc 
we have other contracts for the sale  purchase or exchange of wholesale electricity with other utilities 
in addition  we engage in energy marketing and purchase and sell electricity in areas outside of our retail service territory 
key factors affecting our performance the principal business  economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include weather conditions  customer conservation efforts  the economy  performance of our electric generating facilities and networks  conditions in the fuel  wholesale electricity and energy markets  rate regulation and costs of addressing public policy initiatives  the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources  and capital market conditions 
strategy our strategy is to remain a vertically integrated electric utility meeting the energy needs of our customers reliably at reasonable prices 
we strive to optimize flexibility in our planning and operations to be able to respond quickly to the uncertain and changing energy and environmental policies  economic conditions  regulations and technologies currently affecting or related to our business 
working constructively with our regulators and public officials is an important part of our strategy 
significant elements of our strategy include environmental upgrades to our coal fired power plants  the ability to use more natural gas fired generation  the development of wind generation and the building and upgrading of transmission facilities 
we also plan to invest significant resources to enhance our distribution system and to develop energy efficiency programs 
following is a summary of some of the progress we have made on these significant elements 
during  we made capital expenditures of million at our power plants for air emission controls 

table of contents we completed construction of the emporia energy center  a natural gas fired peaking power plant comprising approximately mw of capacity  in early for a total investment of million 
along with third parties  we developed approximately mw of wind generation facilities at three different sites in kansas  approximately half of which we own and half of which we purchase under long term supply contracts 
these wind generation facilities began producing energy in late and early we continued constructing a kv transmission line in central kansas 
we are actively engaged in numerous programs to enable and educate customers to use energy more efficiently 
our plans and expectations for and beyond include the potential to invest an additional million of capital expenditures at our power plants for air emissions projects over the next three years 
in january  we reached an agreement with a third party to acquire the development rights for a site we believe is capable of supporting up to mw of wind generation 
we expect to develop the site in phases with the initial phase potentially completed by the end of  subject to regulatory approvals and the pace of development of new transmission facilities in western kansas 
we expect to complete in the kv transmission line we are constructing in central kansas 
in  we expect to begin planning and engineering a kv transmission line that will run from a location near wichita  kansas  south to the kansas oklahoma border 
upon approval from the spp board of directors and appropriate regional cost allocation  prairie wind transmission  llc  a joint venture company of which we own  intends to construct a new substation near wichita  kansas  and one near medicine lodge  kansas  as well as a transmission line connecting the two substations 
prairie wind also plans to construct a transmission line south to the kansas oklahoma border from one of the two substations 
we expect to continue improving our distribution system through enhanced vegetation management as well as equipment and process improvements 
we expect to continue developing programs to better educate our customers about the efficient use of energy 
one project we expect to undertake beginning in is smartstar lawrence  a smart grid project based in lawrence  kansas 
under this project  we will install advanced metering infrastructure meters and other equipment to give customers the ability to better monitor their energy use 
we applied for and have been selected by the doe to negotiate a matching grant of approximately million 
we expect the total project cost to approximate million 
summary of significant items overview several significant items have impacted or may impact us and our operations since january  we reported net income of million and basic eps of for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and basic eps of for the year ended december  see decrease in net income below for an explanation of the decrease in net income  the weather in our service territory during the third quarter of was the coolest in over years 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during this period was cooler than the same period in and cooler than the year average 
the cooler weather during this period was a key contributor to the decrease in residential and commercial sales in  the downturn in the global and us economy continued to impact our business throughout see economic conditions below for additional information  
table of contents we received regulatory approval to increase our retail prices 
for additional information  see changes in prices below as well as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation  we reached a settlement with the irs for years and associated with the re characterization of a portion of the loss we incurred on the sale of protection one from a capital loss to an ordinary loss 
this settlement resulted in a net earnings benefit from discontinued operations of million  or per share  net of million we paid protection one  we made capital expenditures of million during see increased capacity and future plans and liquidity and capital resources below for additional information  kge issued million principal amount of first mortgage bonds as part of our efforts to raise the funds needed for our capital projects 
we also repaid million principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
we expect to continue to issue equity and debt securities as external funds are needed to complete planned capital expenditures 
on january   we announced a settlement with the doj of a pending lawsuit over allegations regarding environmental air regulations 
the settlement provides for us to install additional air emission control equipment at jeffrey energy center 
we have not yet engineered this project  however  our preliminary estimate of the project cost is approximately million 
we will also invest million over six years in environmental mitigation projects which we will own  invest million in environmental mitigation projects that will be owned by a qualifying third party and pay a million civil penalty 
accordingly  we have recorded a million liability pursuant to the terms of the settlement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies epa lawsuit  for additional information 
decrease in net income net income decreased million in compared to due primarily to lower sales  lower average wholesale prices and higher income tax expense offset largely by price increases authorized by the kcc 
retail sales were lower due principally to cooler weather and the effects of recessionary conditions particularly impacting our industrial sales 
in  we recognized million of previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax liabilities and million in state tax incentives related to investment and jobs creation in kansas 
we did not recognize similar income tax benefits in continuing operations in resulting in higher income tax expense 
economic conditions despite improvements in the capital markets and increases in asset valuations  many aspects of the downturn in the global and us economy continued to impact our business throughout most notably  many of our industrial customers continued to experience reduced production 
this resulted in decreased demand for electricity from these customers as evidenced by the decrease in industrial sales from to additionally  the kansas unemployment rate increased from in december to in july before declining to in december we cannot predict when these economic conditions may improve or to what extent they may continue to affect electricity sales  including effects that may spill over into residential and commercial sales  and the affect this might have on our consolidated financial results 
changes in prices on may   the kcc issued an order allowing us to adjust our prices to include costs associated with environmental investments made in this change went into effect on june   and is expected to increase our annual retail revenues by million 

table of contents on march   the kcc issued an order allowing us to adjust our prices to include updated transmission costs 
this change went into effect on march   and is expected to increase our annual retail revenues by million 
on january   the kcc issued an order expected to increase our annual retail prices by million to reflect investments in natural gas generation facilities  wind generation facilities and other capital projects  costs to repair damage to our electrical system  which were previously deferred as a regulatory asset  higher operating costs in general and an updated capital structure 
the new prices became effective on february  current trends energy marketing conditions in the wholesale energy markets have made it more difficult for us to produce energy marketing margins at historical levels 
we expect these conditions to persist 
as a result  we anticipate future energy marketing margins below historical levels 
wholesale power market conditions include low electricity prices relative to historical levels  lower natural gas prices  reduced demand for electricity in general and  due to an increase in the number of parties transacting through exchanges and power pools  fewer customers willing to enter into bilateral wholesale energy contracts 
environmental regulation environmental laws and regulations affecting power plants  which relate primarily to discharges into the air  air quality  discharges of effluents into water  the use of water  and the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous and non hazardous substances and wastes  continue to evolve and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
while certain of these costs are recoverable through the ecrr  we cannot assure that all such costs will be recoverable in full and in a timely manner from customers 
potential for greenhouse gas regulation for the past several years  there has been ongoing debate regarding how the release of ghgs may affect the climate 
there is pending legislation regarding the regulation of such gases and there have been court decisions affirming concerns about them 
on june   the us house of representatives passed a bill which  if passed by the senate and signed into law by the president  would require reductions in ghg emissions and  even beyond that  would impose additional expense for virtually all such emissions  even those below the stated targeted emission levels 
the bill identifies seven gasses  including co  as ghgs  and introduces a target to reduce ghg emissions below levels by  below levels by  below levels by and below levels by the bill also mandates that retail electric utilities receive of their power from renewable sources by  with this requirement increasing to by  in certain circumstances  a portion of this requirement could be satisfied through energy efficiency measures 
on september   similar legislation was introduced in the us senate 
the targets for ghg emission reductions under the senate bill are below levels by  below levels by  below levels by and below levels by 
table of contents on april   the administrator of the epa issued a proposed finding that ghg emissions from mobile sources cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers the public health and welfare 
the endangerment finding was proposed in response to a us supreme court s ruling in april that ghgs are pollutants as defined in the clean air act 
if the epa proposal becomes final  the epa will be required to enact ghg emission standards for mobile sources 
on september   the epa and the us department of transportation released a proposed joint rule that would regulate ghg emissions from passenger cars and light trucks 
if the rule becomes final  it may render ghg  s including co  subject to regulation under the clean air act 
on september   the epa released its final rule requiring mandatory reporting of ghg emissions from all economic sectors 
our generating facilities are subject to these new reporting requirements 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a proposed rule under the clean air act and indicated its expectation that it would enact regulations to control ghg emissions 
there is substantial uncertainty with respect to whether us federal ghg legislation will be enacted into law or whether the epa will regulate ghg emissions  and there is additional uncertainty regarding the final provisions and implementation of any potential us federal ghg legislation or epa rules regulating ghg emissions 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of the legislative and rulemaking processes or a specific related impact on our generating facilities and consolidated financial results 
allowance for funds used during construction allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity 
we compute afudc by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress 
we credit to other income for equity funds and interest expense for borrowed funds the amount of afudc capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows year ended december  in thousands borrowed funds equity funds total average afudc rates we expect both afudc for borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate over the next several years as we execute our capital expenditure program 
interest expense we expect interest expense to increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program 
we believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers  as the cost of capital is a component of future rate proceedings 
in addition  short term interest rates are extremely low by historical standards  which we do not expect to persist 
wholesale sales margins as a result of the january   kcc order  the amount to be credited back to retail customers  beginning in march  is based on the actual margins realized from market based wholesale sales 
prior to march  the terms of the reca required that we include  as a credit to recoverable fuel costs beginning in april of each year  an amount based on the average of the margins realized from market based wholesale sales during the immediately prior three year period ending june 
table of contents outlook in  we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach 
in addition to the price increase authorized as a result of our abbreviated rate case  we anticipate other price increases in the form of rate formulae adjustments to take effect in we also expect a return to normal weather  which we expect to result in residential and commercial sales trends more in line with historical levels 
we expect industrial sales to remain below the levels experienced previous to the economic downturn and to be not much different than in as mentioned above  we anticipate future energy marketing margins below historical levels due to changes in wholesale energy market conditions that we believe will persist 
we expect operating and maintenance as well as selling  general and administrative expenses to trend in line with historic labor increases and inflation rates 
we expect depreciation expense to increase in as a result of plant additions during the year 
furthermore  we expect to contribute million to our pension and post retirement benefit plans and wolf creek s pension plan in we plan to increase capital spending in as provided under future cash requirements below 
as a result  in january and february  westar energy issued million shares of common stock for proceeds of million through a sales agency financing agreement with a bank 
westar energy may issue additional shares of common stock in critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
were we to deem it improbable that we would recover such costs  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 
as of december   we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately million and regulatory liabilities of million as discussed in greater detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies regulatory accounting 
we believe that it is probable that our regulatory assets will be recovered in the future 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by applicable gaap 

table of contents in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
changes in these assumptions will result in changes to regulatory assets  regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and other post retirement liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
such changes may also require cash contributions

revenue recognition energy sales we record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers 
we determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters 
at the end of each month  we estimate how much electricity we have delivered since the prior meter reading and record the corresponding unbilled revenue 

table of contents the accuracy of our unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand  weather  line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes 
we had estimated unbilled revenue of million as of december   and million as of december  the increase in unbilled revenue reflects price increases as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the fair value method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of certain fuel supply and electricity sale contracts  which we record as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities  we include the net change in fair value in revenues on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the resulting unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data are available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
the prices we use to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of the fair value of these contracts 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 
the tables below show the fair value of energy marketing contracts that were outstanding as of december   their sources and maturity periods 
fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  a contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  b a approximately million of the fair value of energy marketing contracts was recognized as a regulatory liability 
b approximately million and million of the fair value of energy marketing contracts were recognized as a regulatory asset and regulatory liability  respectively 
the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts as of december   are summarized in the following table 
fair value of contracts at end of period sources of fair value total fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity over years in thousands prices actively quoted futures prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on option pricing models options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a options are priced using a series of techniques  such as the black option pricing model 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices 
we recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we record deferred tax assets for carryforwards of capital losses  operating losses and tax credits 
however  when we believe based on available evidence that we do not  or will not have sufficient future capital gain income or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we report the effect of a change in the valuation allowance in the current period tax expense 
the application of income tax law is complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous 
accordingly  we must make judgments regarding income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a result  changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes  for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes 
asset retirement obligations legal liability we have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of such assets 
concurrent with the recognition of the liability  the estimated cost of the asset retirement obligation aro is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
we estimate our aros based on the fair value of the aros we incurred at the time the related long lived assets were either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective 
we initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek our share  dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants  remediate ash disposal ponds and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil 
in determining our aros  we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the aros reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we have recorded aros of million and million  respectively 
for additional information on our legal aros  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
non legal liability cost of removal we recover in our prices the costs to dispose of plant assets that do not represent legal retirement obligations 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in amounts collected  but not yet spent  for removal costs classified as a regulatory liability 
the net amount related to non legal retirement costs can fluctuate based on amounts recovered in our prices compared to removal costs incurred 

table of contents contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see note and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies epa lawsuit ferc investigation and legal proceedings  for more detailed information 
operating results we evaluate operating results based on eps 
we have various classifications of revenues  defined as follows retail sales of energy made to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other retail sales of energy for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
wholesale sales of energy to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by ferc authority 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts for the sale of such energy that have yet to settle 
margins realized from these sales serve to lower our retail prices 
energy marketing includes i transactions based on market prices and volumes generally unrelated to the production of our generating assets  ii financially settled products and physical transactions sourced outside of our control area  iii fees we earn for marketing services that we provide for third parties  and iv changes in valuations of contracts related to those transactions listed in i and ii above that have yet to settle 
transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on tariffs with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
electric utility revenues are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  fuel costs  customer conservation efforts  the economy of our service area and competitive forces 
changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use 
as a summer peaking utility  our sales are seasonal and the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest sales 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among our residential customers 
mild weather reduces customer demand 
our wholesale revenues are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity and transmission availability 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow

c change greater than 

table of contents gross margin fuel and purchased power costs fluctuate as retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit costs change 
as permitted by regulators  we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power needed to serve our customers 
fuel and purchased power costs for our wholesale customers are recovered in prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by ferc 
as a result  changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with a minimal impact on net income 
for this reason  we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap measurement  is a useful measure for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next 
gross margin is calculated as total revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and spp network transmission costs 
transmission costs reflect the costs of providing network transmission service 
we recognize a significant amount of transmission revenue in connection with such service 
we record these costs in operating and maintenance expense on our consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands revenues residential commercial industrial   a other retail total retail revenues wholesale energy marketing transmission other total revenues less fuel and purchased power expense spp network transmission costs gross margin a change less than

energy marketing activities are unrelated to the amount of electricity we generate 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total 
table of contents the increase in gross margin in compared to was due principally to the increase in total retail revenues 
total retail revenues increased primarily as a result of price increases authorized by the kcc  which more than offset the decrease in total retail sales 
the decreases in both residential and commercial sales were attributable primarily to cooler weather  particularly during the third quarter of as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during the third quarter of was cooler than the same period in and cooler than the year average 
industrial sales decreased due principally to the effects of recessionary conditions that served to reduce industrial demand for electricity 
in addition  wholesale revenues decreased compared to due principally to a lower average market price for these sales that was the result  primarily  of reduced demand and lower natural gas prices 
substantially all of the margins realized on these sales are returned to our customers 
the increase in energy marketing was attributable primarily to our having settled forward contracts for the sale of electricity on favorable terms in offsetting these favorable settlements was lower demand generally  lower market prices and more customers transacting through power pools and exchanges as opposed to entering into bilateral agreements with us 
income from operations is the most directly comparable measure to gross margin that is calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our consolidated statements of income 
our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations 
additionally  our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations other operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due primarily to a million increase in spp network transmission costs  which was offset by higher transmission revenues of million 
maintenance expense increased million due principally to a million increase in amounts expensed for previously deferred storm costs and higher maintenance costs of million for our new generating facilities 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense we completed a number of large construction projects in the last two years 
consequently  depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of these plant additions 
during  we recorded depreciation expense of million for emporia energy center  million for wind generation facilities and million for various transmission projects 
during  we recorded depreciation expense of million for emporia energy center and million for the same transmission projects described above 
we did not record any depreciation expense for the wind generation facilities in because they were not yet in service 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to a million increase in pension and other employee benefit costs 
in addition  we recorded a million expense related to the settlement of the epa lawsuit discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment earnings losses investment earnings increased compared to due principally to our having recorded an million gain on investments held in a trust to fund non qualified retirement benefits 
we recorded a million loss on those investments in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other income other income decreased due principally to our having recorded less equity afudc and corporate owned life insurance coli benefit in we recorded million of equity afudc in compared to million of equity afudc recorded during the prior year 
this decrease reflects the completion of several large construction projects in in addition  we recorded million of coli benefit in compared to million of coli benefit recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest expense in  we reversed million of accrued interest associated with uncertain income tax positions  which reduced interest expense 
we did not record such a reversal in and  as a result  our interest expense is higher 
absent this reversal  interest expense increased million compared to due principally to interest on additional debt issued to fund capital investments 
contributing to the increase was our having recorded million less for capitalized interest as a result of completing several large construction projects in these factors were offset partially by a million decrease in interest related to lower interest rates and less borrowing under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense    a a change greater than 
in  we recognized million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits associated with uncertain income tax positions and million in state tax credits related to investment and jobs creation within the state of kansas  both of which decreased income tax expense 
we did not recognize similar income tax benefits in continuing operations in 
table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow

table of contents the following table reflects changes in electric sales for the years ended december  and no sales are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to the amount of electricity we generate 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total the decrease in gross margin in compared to was due primarily to the decrease in energy marketing  cooler weather  reduced margins on power sold to a few large industrial customers and additional planned outages at our base load plants 
energy marketing decreased due principally to the need to focus resources toward serving our retail customers during outages  changes in the relationships of prices among energy products historically traded and the continuing maturation of energy markets in which we participate reducing margin opportunities 
contributing to the decrease in energy marketing was the recognition of a million customer refund obligation and a million obligation related to claims made by an independent system operator seeking the re pricing of transactions conducted within that operator s region in prior periods 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was cooler than and cooler than the year average 
this cooler weather was the primary contributor to the decreases in residential and commercial sales 
additionally  in  we sold power to a few large industrial customers under contracts to which the reca did not apply and  primarily as a result of higher fuel costs  margins on these sales were million lower compared to all of these contracts expired in furthermore  we had additional planned outages at our base load plants in that were longer in duration than in these additional planned outages required us to use more expensive fuel and to incur additional purchased power expense  which resulted in reduced margins on power sold despite higher prevailing market prices 
the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations other operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million due to depreciation expense associated with more plant being in service 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense the million increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to a million increase in legal costs 
various court orders require that we pay legal fees incurred by two former executive officers related to the defense of criminal charges filed against them by the united states attorneys office 
higher legal expenses were also related to more regulatory activities 
also contributing to the increase was million in additional labor costs and a million increase in bad debt expense 
offsetting these increases was a million decrease in employee benefits expense 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment losses earnings investment earnings decreased million due primarily to our having recorded a million loss on investments held in a trust used to fund retirement benefits 
we recorded a million gain on these investments in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other income other income increased million due primarily to our having recorded million of equity afudc in compared to million of equity afudc recorded in also contributing to the increase was a million gain on the sale of oil in in addition  we recorded million of coli benefit in compared to million of coli benefit recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest expense interest expense increased million due primarily to interest on additional debt issued to fund investments in capital equipment 
partially offsetting this increase was the reversal of million of accrued interest associated with uncertain tax liabilities during year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense income tax expense decreased million due to the recognition of million of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the recognition of million in state tax credits related to investment and jobs creation within the state of kansas 
financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december   compared to december  
table of contents cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
conditions in capital markets for short term borrowing improved throughout the year as evidenced by lower interest rates 
therefore  during the year we decreased cash holdings to levels more consistent with our historical practice 
the fair market value of energy marketing contracts decreased million to million at december  this was due principally to the fair value measurement of a fuel supply contract decreasing million 
the portion of this fuel supply contract outstanding the entire period decreased million due to decreased coal prices 
further decreasing the fair value measurement of this fuel supply contract was the settlement of a million net gain position during the year 
prepaid expenses decreased million and accrued interest increased million since december   due principally to a policy change under which we no longer pay interest on coli policies in advance 
in addition  other non current assets increased million and other current liabilities decreased million due primarily to a policy change to cease borrowing against future increases in the cash surrender value of our coli policies 
regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities  decreased million to million at december   from million at december  total regulatory assets decreased million due primarily to a million decrease in deferred employee benefit costs as a result of favorable pension plan asset performance and pension contributions  million amortization of deferred storm costs  and million decrease in net amounts due from customers for future income taxes 
total regulatory liabilities increased million due principally to a million increase in our refund obligation related to the reca and an million increase in removal cost for amounts collected  but not yet spent to remove retired assets 
increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the fair value of fuel supply contracts 
long term debt  net of current maturities  increased million due principally to the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds as discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
unamortized investment tax credits increased million due to incentives we earned related to investments in plant located in the state of kansas 
accrued employee benefits decreased million due primarily to favorable plan asset performance and our having contributed million to westar energy s and wolf creek s pension plans 
asset retirement obligations increased million due predominately to a million increase in our aro to reflect revisions to the estimated costs to decommission wolf creek 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations  for additional information 
other long term liabilities decreased million due primarily to a million decrease in our long term liability for uncertain income tax positions and related accrued interest due to the settlement of an irs examination 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain income tax positions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview available sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash  westar energy s revolving credit facility and access to capital markets 
we expect to meet our day to day cash requirements including  among other items fuel and purchased power  dividends  interest payments  income taxes and pension contributions  using primarily internally generated cash and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
to meet the cash requirements for our capital investments  we expect to use internally generated cash  borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets 
we also use proceeds from the issuance of securities to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility  with those borrowed amounts principally related to investments in capital equipment  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the aforementioned sources and uses of cash are similar to our historical activities 
for additional information on our future cash requirements  see future cash requirements below 
beginning late in the first quarter  capital market conditions improved significantly during compared to the unprecedented volatility experienced in late and early given these improvements  we plan to increase our capital spending in additionally  we expect to contribute less to our pension trust in we do not expect the current economic conditions to impact our ability to pay dividends 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include  among others factors affecting revenues described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets 
capital resources on february   ferc granted our request to issue short term securities and pledge kge mortgage bonds in order to increase the size of westar energy s revolving credit facility from million to million 
on february   a syndicate of banks in the credit facility increased their commitments to million in the aggregate with million of the commitments terminating on march   and the remaining million of commitments terminating on march  lehman brothers commercial paper  inc lehman brothers was the participating lender with respect to the million commitment terminating on march  on october   lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy protection 
under terms of the credit facility  we have the right to replace lehman brothers should another lender or lenders be willing to replace the million commitment 
to date  we have elected not to seek a replacement lender 
as a result  until such time as we seek and locate a replacement lender or lenders  the revolving credit facility is limited to million 
on january   ferc approved our request for authority to issue short term securities and pledge kge mortgage bonds in order to increase the size of westar energy s revolving credit facility to billion 
we have not yet exercised our authority to increase the size of the facility 
as of february   million had been borrowed and an additional million of letters of credit had been issued under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of the same date 
a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million would be a default under this facility 
westar energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio not greater than at all times 
at december   our ratio was 
available liquidity under the facility is not impacted by a decline in westar energy s credit ratings 
also  the facility does not contain a material adverse effect clause requiring westar energy to represent  prior to each borrowing  that no event resulting in a material adverse effect has occurred 
the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 

table of contents under the westar energy mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  so long as any bonds issued prior to january   remain outstanding  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on  and of the principal amount of  all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 
under the kge mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on  or of the principal amount of  all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
common stock issuance on may   westar energy entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of million shares of its common stock 
on june   westar energy issued all million shares and received million in total proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and fees related to the offering 
on november   westar energy entered into a forward sale agreement with a bank  as forward purchaser  relating to million shares of its common stock 
the forward sale agreement provided for the sale of westar energy s common stock within approximately twelve months at a stated settlement price 
in connection with the forward sale agreement  the bank borrowed an equal number of shares of westar energy s common stock from stock lenders and sold the borrowed shares to another bank under an underwriting agreement among westar energy and the banks 
the underwriters subsequently offered the borrowed shares to the public at a price per share of 
on december   westar energy delivered million newly issued shares of its common stock to a bank and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
additionally  on february   westar energy delivered million shares and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
on june   westar energy completed the forward sale agreement by delivering million shares and receiving proceeds of million 
on august   westar energy entered into a sales agency financing agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  westar energy may offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through the bank  as agent  up to an aggregate of million for a period of no more than three years 
westar energy will pay the bank a commission equal to of the sales price of all shares sold under the agreement 
during westar energy sold million shares of common stock through the bank for million and received million in proceeds net of commission 
during westar energy sold million shares of common stock through the bank for million and received million in proceeds net of commission 
westar energy did not sell any shares of common stock under this agreement during in january and february  westar energy issued million shares of common stock through the bank for million 
westar energy may issue additional shares of common stock in on april   westar energy entered into a sales agency financing agreement with the same bank 
as of july   westar energy had sold million shares of its common stock for million pursuant to the agreement 
westar energy received million in proceeds net of a commission 

table of contents westar energy used the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility  with those borrowed amounts principally related to our investments in capital equipment  as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million of cash in the year ended december   compared with cash provided from operating activity of million during the same period of principal contributors to the increase were our having paid million less for fuel and purchased power and million less for interest on our coli policies 
partially offsetting increases were our having received million less in customer receipts during due primarily to lower cash receipts from our wholesale customers which more than offset higher cash receipts from our retail customers and our having paid million more in interest on debt 
operating activities provided million of cash in the year ended december   compared with cash provided from operating activity of million during the same period of principal contributors to the increase were additional collections from customers during due in large part to our having recovered higher fuel costs from customers through the reca and million in lower income tax payments in compared to the prior year 
offsetting these increases were our having paid million to restore our electrical system which was severely damaged by an ice storm in december  additional outages occurring in at our base load plants  our having paid more for fuel and purchased power in compared to the prior year  and during  we paid million more for our share of wolf creek s refueling outage 
cash flows used in investing activities our principal use of cash for investing purposes relates to growing and improving our utility plant 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in plant on an annual basis 
we spent million in  million in and million in on additions to property  plant and equipment 
the decrease in was due principally to the completion of environmental projects  wind generation projects  transmission projects and the construction of emporia energy center  which required significant amounts of cash in and cash flows from financing activities we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million and proceeds from short term debt provided million 
we used cash to repay million of long term debt and to pay million in dividends 
we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million and borrowings from coli provided million 
we used cash to pay million in dividends and to retire million of long term debt 
in  we received net cash flows from financing activities of million 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million 
we used cash to pay million in dividends 
cash flows used in investing activities of discontinued operations we paid protection one million for its share of the net tax benefit related to the net operating loss carryforward arising from our sale of protection one 

table of contents future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect to need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities related to providing electric service  which include but are not limited to expenditures for environmental improvements at our coal fired power plants  new transmission lines and other improvements to our power plants  transmission and distribution lines  and equipment 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash flow  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility and through the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur material costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations  all of which are subject to changing interpretations and amendments 
changes to environmental regulations could result in significantly more stringent laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that could affect our company and industry in particular 
these laws  regulations and interpretations could result in more stringent terms in our existing operating permits or a failure to obtain new permits could cause a material increase in our capital or operational costs and could otherwise have a material effect on our operations 
while we believe we can generally recover environmental costs through price increases  there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
on january   we announced a settlement with the doj of a pending lawsuit over allegations regarding environmental air regulations 
the settlement was filed with the us district court in the district of kansas  seeking its approval 
the settlement provides for us to install an scr system on one of the three jeffrey energy center coal units by the end of we have not yet engineered this project  however  our preliminary estimate of the cost of this scr is approximately million 
depending on the nox emission reductions attained by the single scr and attainable through the installation of other controls on the other two jeffrey energy center coal units  a second scr system would be installed on another jeffrey energy center coal unit by the end of  if needed to meet nox reduction targets 
recovery of costs to install these systems is subject to the approval of our regulators 
we believe these costs are appropriate for inclusion in the prices we are allowed to charge our customers 
we will also invest million over six years in environmental mitigation projects which we will own and million in environmental mitigation projects that will be owned by a qualifying third party 
we will also pay a million civil penalty 
accordingly  we have recorded a million liability pursuant to the terms of the settlement 
we expect the court to make a decision in following the expiration of a period for public comments on march  if the court does not approve the settlement  and the lawsuit proceeds to trial  a decision in favor of the doj and epa could require us to update or install additional emissions controls at jeffrey energy center  and the additional controls could be more extensive than those required by the current settlement 
additionally  we could be required to update or install emissions controls at our other coal fired plants  pay fines or penalties or take other remedial action 
our ultimate costs to resolve the lawsuit could be material and we would expect to incur substantial legal fees and expenses related to the defense of the lawsuit 
we are not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if the court were to not approve the settlement

maturities of long term debt as of december   are as follows 
principal amount year in thousands thereafter total long term debt maturities pension obligation as provided in the september   kcc order regarding pension and post retirement benefits  we expect to fund our pension plan each year at least to a level equal to our current year pension expense

debt financings as of december   we had million of variable rate  tax exempt bonds 
prior to february  interest rates payable under these bonds had historically been set by auctions  which occurred every days 
since then  auctions for these bonds have failed  resulting in alternative index based interest rates for these bonds of between less than and 
on july   the kcc approved our request for authority permitting us to remarket or refund all or part of these auction rate bonds 
on each of october   october   and august   kge refinanced million of auction rate bonds at fixed interest rates of  and  respectively  all with maturity dates of june  we continue to monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to the remaining auction rate bonds 
on august   we repaid million principal amount of unsecured senior notes with borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility 
on june   kge issued million principal amount of first mortgage bonds at a discount yielding  bearing stated interest at and maturing on june  kge received net proceeds of million 
in addition  kge amended its mortgage and deed of trust  dated april   as supplemented  in june to increase the maximum amount of kge first mortgage bonds authorized to be issued from billion to billion 
on november   westar energy issued million principal amount of first mortgage bonds at a discount yielding  bearing stated interest at and maturing on december  we received net proceeds of million 
on may   kge issued million principal amount of first mortgage bonds in a private placement transaction with million of the principal amount bearing interest at and maturing on may   and million bearing interest at and maturing on may  in january  we increased the size of our month equipment financing loan agreement to million for computer equipment purchases made in as of december   the balance of this loan was million 
proceeds from the issuance of first mortgage bonds were used to repay borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility  with those borrowed amounts principally related to investments in capital equipment  as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 
debt covenants some of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the agreements 
we calculate these ratios in accordance with our credit agreements 
these ratios are used solely to determine compliance with our various debt covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  
table of contents credit ratings moody s investors service moody s  standard poor s ratings group s p and fitch investors service fitch are independent credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities 
these ratings indicate each agency s assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities 
in august  moody s upgraded its credit ratings for westar energy s and kge s first mortgage bonds senior secured debt securities 
s p changed its rating outlooks for westar energy s and kge s debt securities from stable to positive in april and upgraded its credit rating for westar energy s unsecured debt securities in november in august  fitch upgraded its credit ratings for westar energy s first mortgage bonds senior secured debt securities and unsecured debt securities as well as kge s first mortgage bonds senior secured debt securities 
fitch also changed its outlook for our ratings from positive to stable 
as of february   ratings with these agencies are as shown in the table below 
westar energy first mortgage bond rating kge first mortgage bond rating westar energy unsecured debt rating outlook moody s baa baa baa stable s p bbb bbb bbb positive fitch bbb bbb bbb stable in general  less favorable credit ratings make borrowing more difficult and costly 
under westar energy s revolving credit facility our cost of borrowing is determined in part by our credit ratings 
however  our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is not conditioned on maintaining a particular credit rating 
we may enter into new credit agreements that contain credit rating conditions  which could affect our liquidity and or our borrowing costs 
factors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria 
objective criteria include typical financial ratios  such as total debt to total capitalization and funds from operations to total debt  among others  future capital expenditures and our access to liquidity including committed lines of credit 
subjective criteria include such items as the quality and credibility of management  the political and regulatory environment we operate in and an assessment of our governance and risk management practices 
certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions subject to credit agency ratings of our senior unsecured debt 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings were to decrease or fall below investment grade  the counterparties to the derivative instruments  pursuant to the provisions  could require collateralization on derivative instruments 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with objective credit risk related contingent features that were in a liability position as of december   was million  for which we had posted no collateral 
if all credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered as of december   we would have been required to provide to our counterparties million of additional collateral after taking into consideration the offsetting impact of derivative assets and net accounts receivable 
capital structure as of december  and  our capital structure excluding short term debt was as follows common equity preferred stock long term debt 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements forward equity transaction on november   westar energy entered into a forward sale agreement relating to million shares of its common stock 
the forward sale agreement provided for the sale of westar energy s common stock within approximately twelve months at a stated settlement price 
on december   westar energy delivered million newly issued shares of its common stock to a bank and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
additionally  on february   westar energy delivered million shares and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
on june   westar energy completed the forward sale agreement by delivering million shares of its common stock and receiving proceeds of million 
as of december   we did not have any additional off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than our operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business 
for additional information on our operating leases  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  leases 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the course of our business activities  we enter into a variety of obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these result in direct obligations reflected on our consolidated balance sheets while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  not reflected in our underlying consolidated financial statements 
the obligations listed below include amounts for on going needs for which contractual obligations existed as of december

f coal and natural gas commodity and transportation contracts 
g uranium concentrates  conversion  enrichment  fabrication and spent nuclear fuel disposal 
h we have an additional million of unrecognized income tax benefits  including interest  that are not included in this table because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the cash payments to taxing authorities assuming those unrecognized tax benefits are settled at the amounts accrued as of december  commercial commitments our commercial commitments as of december   consist of outstanding letters of credit that expire in  some of which automatically renew annually 
the letters of credit are comprised of million related to worker s compensation  million related to new transmission projects  million related to our energy marketing and trading activities and million related to other operating activities for a total outstanding balance of million 

table of contents other information stock based compensation we use restricted share units rsus exclusively for our stock based compensation awards 
total unrecognized compensation cost related to rsu awards was million as of december  we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted average period of years 
there were no modifications of awards during the years ended december   or environmental regulation on may   the state of kansas enacted legislation that mandates  among other requirements  that more energy be derived from renewable sources 
according to the law  in years through net renewable generation capacity must be of the average peak demand for the three prior years 
this requirement increases to for years through and for and thereafter 
a further provision of the law is that the kcc may elect not to enforce these requirements if they result in more than a increase in our prices 
we estimate that we may need to add about to mw of additional renewable generating capacity to meet the requirement 
in january  we reached an agreement with a third party to acquire the development rights for a site we believe is capable of supporting up to mw of wind generation 
we expect to develop the site in phases with the initial phase potentially completed by the end of  subject to regulatory approvals and the pace of development of new transmission facilities in western kansas 
additionally  the epa may develop new regulations  and congress may pass new legislation  that impose additional requirements on facilities that store or dispose of non hazardous fossil fuel combustion materials  including coal ash 
if so  we may be required to change our current practices and incur additional capital expenditures and or operating expenses to comply with these regulations 
the degree to which we may need to produce renewable energy or change our current practices related to the storage and disposal of non hazardous materials and the timing of when equipment may be required are uncertain 
both the timing and nature of required investments and actions depend on specific outcomes that result from interpretation of new and existing regulation and legislation 
although we would expect to recover in the prices we charge our customers the costs that we incur to comply with environmental regulations  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully and timely do so 
failure to recover these associated costs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
new accounting pronouncements we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap for the united states of america 
to address current issues in accounting  regulatory bodies have issued the following new accounting pronouncements that may affect our accounting and or disclosure 
fasb codification in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved its accounting standards codification codification as the exclusive authoritative reference for us gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
sec rules and interpretive releases are still considered authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification  which changes the referencing of accounting standards  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september  we adopted the codification effective july   without a material impact on our consolidated financial results 

table of contents variable interest entities in june  fasb issued guidance that amends the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities vies 
the amended guidance requires a qualitative assessment rather than a quantitative assessment in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie and significantly changes the consolidation criteria to be considered in determining the primary beneficiary 
pursuant to the amended guidance  there is no exclusion  or grandfathering  of vies that were not consolidated under prior guidance 
this amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  we adopted the guidance effective january   and  as a result  expect to consolidate vies that were previously not consolidated 
the vies we expect to consolidate include certain trusts that hold assets we lease 
consolidation of these vies will eliminate the lease accounting we now report for these assets and result in changes in our consolidated assets  debt and equity 
any changes in net income that occur as a result of the elimination of lease accounting and consolidation of vies will be offset through the recognition of either a regulatory asset or liability 
consolidation of these vies will also result in changes to our consolidated statements of cash flows related to each vie s cash activity 
we continue to evaluate the impact that consolidating these vies will have on our consolidated financial results 
the changes to our consolidated assets  debt and equity may be material 
recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments in april  fasb issued guidance that addresses the measurement and recognition of other than temporary impairments of investments in debt securities 
the guidance also provides for changes in the presentation and disclosure requirements surrounding other than temporary impairments of investments in debt and equity securities 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  we adopted this guidance effective april   without a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
employers disclosures about post retirement benefit plan assets in december  fasb issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
these disclosures include how investment allocation decisions are made  the factors pertinent to understanding investment policies and strategies  the fair value of each major category of plan assets for pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans separately  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
we adopted this guidance effective december  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and wolf creek employee benefit plans 
determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities in june  fasb issued guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
the guidance provides that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with retrospective application to prior periods 
we adopted this guidance effective january  see earnings per share under note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  fasb issued guidance that requires expanded disclosure to help investors better understand how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
the guidance amends and expands the disclosure requirements related to derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring qualitative disclosure about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosure about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted this guidance effective january  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial and derivative instruments  trading securities  energy marketing and risk management 
fair value measurements in september  fasb issued guidance that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we adopted the guidance for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis effective january   and for non financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial and derivative instruments  trading securities  energy marketing and risk management 
in april  fasb issued guidance on two separate fair value issues 
both of the releases are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and we adopted both of them effective april  one of the releases provides guidance for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and for identifying transactions that are not orderly 
we adopted this guidance without a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
the other release requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial and derivative instruments  trading securities  energy marketing and risk management 
in september  fasb issued guidance permitting entities to measure the fair value of certain investments on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investments and requiring additional disclosure about such fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  we adopted the guidance effective october   without a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial and derivative instruments  trading securities  energy marketing and risk management 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fuel procurement and energy marketing activities involve primary market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy related products 
credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates 
market price risks we engage in physical and financial trading activities with the goal of managing our commodity price risk  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we procure and trade electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products by utilizing energy commodity contracts and a variety of financial instruments  including forward and futures contracts  options and swaps 
prices in the wholesale power markets often are extremely volatile 
this volatility impacts our cost of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would attempt to purchase power from others 
such supplies are not always available 
in addition  congestion on the transmission system can limit our ability to make purchases from  or sell into  the wholesale markets 
the inability to make wholesale purchases may require that we interrupt or curtail services to our customers 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have net open positions  we are exposed to changes in market prices 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
the availability and deliverability of generating fuel  including fossil and nuclear fuels  can vary significantly from one period to the next 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
the loss of revenues or higher costs associated with such conditions could be material and adverse to our consolidated financial results 
our risk of loss is partially mitigated through the use of tariffs and contracts authorized by regulators that allow us to adjust our prices in response to changing costs 
hedging activity in an effort to mitigate market risk associated with fuel procurement and energy marketing  we may use economic hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to price changes 
we may use physical contracts and financial derivative instruments to hedge the price of a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs or excess generation sales 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine the hedge value until the agreements are actually settled 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 

table of contents commodity price exposure one way by which we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio is by using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the use of var requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and a measure of volatility associated with potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period and a day historical observation period 
it is possible that actual results may differ markedly from assumptions 
accordingly  var may not accurately reflect our levels of exposures 
the energy trading and market based wholesale portfolio var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a variety of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our trading portfolios 
these risks include valuation and marking of illiquid pricing locations and products  the financial condition of our counterparties and interest rate movement 
see the credit risk and interest rate exposure discussions below for additional information 
also  there can be no assurance that the employment of var  credit practices or other risk management tools we employ will eliminate possible losses 
credit risk we have exposure to counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities  including participation in rtos 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as requiring counterparties to issue letters of credit or parental guarantees in our favor and entering into master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions subject to credit rating agencies assessments of our senior unsecured debt 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings were to decrease or fall below investment grade  then the counterparties to the derivative instruments  pursuant to such provisions  could require us to post collateral on derivative instruments 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with objective credit risk related contingent features that were in a liability position as of december   was million  for which we had posted no collateral 
if all credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered as of december   we would have been required to provide to our counterparties million of additional collateral after taking into consideration the offsetting impact of derivative assets and net accounts receivable 
interest rate exposure we have entered into numerous fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we manage our interest rate risk related to these debt obligations by limiting our variable interest rate exposure and utilizing various maturity dates 
we may also use swaps or other financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 

table of contents we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bonds insured by bond insurers 
prior to february  interest rates payable under these bonds historically had been set through periodic auctions 
conditions in the credit markets over the past two years have caused a dramatic reduction in the demand for auction bonds  which has lead to failures in these auctions 
the contractual provisions of these securities set forth an indexing formula method by which interest will be paid in the event of an auction failure 
depending on the level of these reference indices  our interest costs may be higher or lower than what they would have been had the securities been auctioned successfully 
additionally  should insurers of those bond experience a decrease in their credit ratings  such event would most likely increase our borrowing costs as well 
furthermore  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and affect investment returns 
security price risk we maintain trust funds  as required by the nrc and kansas state laws  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund were allocated to equity securities  to debt securities  to real estate securities  to commodities and to cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the equity  debt and real estate securities and commodities would have resulted in an million decrease in the value of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund as of december  we also maintain a trust to fund non qualified retirement benefits 
as of december   these funds were comprised of equity securities and debt securities 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the equity and debt securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of this trust as of december  by maintaining diversified portfolios of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund the aforementioned obligations within acceptable risk tolerances  including interest rate risk 
however  debt and equity securities in the portfolios are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligations rises 
we actively monitor the portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocation in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to security price risk related to the nuclear decommissioning trust fund is  in part  mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the prices we charge our customers
