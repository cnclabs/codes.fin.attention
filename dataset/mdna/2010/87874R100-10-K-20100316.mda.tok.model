application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue  long lived assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see the notes to our financial statements for information about these critical accounting policies as well as a description of our other accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of targeted advertising campaigns that we deliver via our network of websites  events and  prior to  print publications 
in all cases  we recognize revenue only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
although each of our online media offerings can be sold separately  most of our online media sales involve multiple online offerings 
because objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in our bundled advertising campaigns  no allocation can be made  and we recognize revenue on all services over the term of the arrangement 
events 
we sell our events separately from our other service offerings  and recognize event revenue in the period the event occurs 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
print 
when sold separately print advertising revenue was recognized at the time the applicable magazine was distributed 
when print advertising campaigns were sold with online media offerings  we recognized revenue for all services in the advertising campaign over the term of the arrangement 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria were recorded as deferred revenue 
online 
we recognize revenue from our specific online media offerings as follows when these items are sold separately white papers 
we recognize white paper revenue ratably over the period in which the white paper is available on our websites 
webcasts  podcasts and videocasts 
we recognize webcast  podcast and videocast revenue ratably over the period in which the webcast  podcast or videocast is available on our websites 

table of contents software package comparisons 
we recognize software package comparison revenue ratably over the period in which the software information is available on our websites 
promotional e mails and e newsletters

we recognize e newsletter revenue in the period in which the e newsletter is sent 
list rentals 
we recognize list rental revenue in the period in which the e mail is sent to the list of registered members 
banners 
we recognize banner revenue in the period in which the banner impressions occur 
third party revenue sharing arrangements 
revenue from third party revenue sharing arrangements is recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
we offer customers the ability to purchase integrated roi program offerings  which can include any of our online media offerings packaged together to address the particular customer s specific advertising requirements 
as part of these offerings  we will guarantee a minimum number of qualified sales leads to be delivered over the course of the advertising campaign 
we sometimes extend the scheduled end date of advertising campaigns to satisfy lead guarantees or to fulfill all elements of the campaign based on delayed receipt of advertising media collateral from the customer 
we estimate the revenue reserve necessary to properly defer revenue recognition for extended advertising campaigns 
these estimates are based on the company s experience in managing and fulfilling these integrated roi program offerings 
shortfalls in fulfilling lead guarantees before the scheduled completion date of an advertising campaign are satisfied within an average of days of such scheduled completion date 
these integrated roi program offerings represented approximately  and of our online revenues  and  and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets have arisen principally from our acquisitions 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to nine years  using methods of amortization that are expected to reflect the estimated pattern of economic use 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
fair value of financial instruments financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  a term loan payable and an interest rate swap 
the carrying value of these instruments approximates their fair values 
the term loan was paid and interest rate swap terminated in december 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we offset gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis  and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expense 
if our historical collection experience does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables  our future provision for doubtful accounts could be materially affected 
to date  we have not incurred any write offs of accounts receivable significantly different than the amounts reserved 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock based compensation in the statement of operations using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award or using the accelerated method if the award is contingent upon performance goals 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards 
we calculated the fair values of the options granted using the following assumptions years ended december  expected volatility expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected dividend yield weighted average grant date fair value per share as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering in may  and there has been limited historical information on the volatility of our common stock since the date of our initial public offering  we determined the volatility for options granted in  and based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the option 
the expected life of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we applied an annual forfeiture rate based on our historical forfeiture experience of  and in determining the expense recorded in  and  respectively 
internal use software and website development costs we capitalize costs of materials  consultants and compensation and related expenses of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software and website applications and infrastructure involving developing software to operate our websites 
however  we expense as incurred website development costs for new features and functionalities since it is not probable that they will result in additional functionality until they are both developed and tested with confirmation that they are more effective than the current set of features and functionalities on our websites 
our judgment is 
table of contents required in determining the point at which various projects enter the states at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  which is generally three years 
to the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our websites  assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  the amount of website development costs we capitalize and amortize in future periods would be impacted 
we review capitalized internal use software and website development costs for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
we capitalized internal use software and website development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
as of december   we had us federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
the nol carryforwards expire through  and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service 
the internal revenue code contains provisions that limit the nol and tax credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year in the event of certain changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders 
the federal nol carryforwards of million available at december  were acquired from knowledgestorm and are subject to limitations on their use in future years 
net income loss per share we calculate basic earnings per share eps by dividing earnings available to common shareholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares and vested restricted stock awards outstanding 
because the holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  we do not consider these awards to be participating securities that should be included in our computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
diluted eps is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and vested restricted stock awards outstanding during the period  plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method 
in calculating diluted eps  the dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the average market price for the respective period 
in addition  the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average unrecognized compensation expense and assumed tax benefit of stock options that are in the money 
this results in the assumed buyback of additional shares  thereby reducing the dilutive impact of stock options

table of contents seasonality the timing of our revenues is affected by seasonal factors 
our revenues are seasonal primarily as a result of the annual budget approval process of many of our customers and the historical decrease in advertising activity in july and august 
revenues are usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  increase during the second quarter  decrease during the third quarter  and increase again during the fourth quarter 
events revenue may vary depending on which quarters we produce the event  which may vary when compared to previous periods 
the timing of revenues in relation to our expenses  much of which does not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on the cost of online revenue  selling and marketing  product development  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter during the year 
the majority of our expenses are personnel related and include salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and incentive based compensation plan expenses 
as a result  we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in the timing of our expenses period to period 
liquidity and capital resources resources since  we have funded our operations principally with cash flows generated by operations

we have used a portion of these proceeds to repay million that we had borrowed against our revolving credit facility in conjunction with the acquisition of technologyguide 
com in april and to pay to the selling stockholders of knowledgestorm  inc approximately million in november as partial consideration in that acquisition 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our cash flow from operating activities and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the operations of our existing business  our potential strategic expansion internationally  future acquisitions we might undertake  and the expansion into complementary businesses 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more additional acquisitions of businesses 
in the event additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or affect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our subsidiary  techtarget limited  was established in july and is located in london  england 
as of december   most of our international customer agreements have been denominated in us dollars  and aggregate foreign currency payments made by us through this subsidiary have been less than million during the year ended december  we currently believe our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is financially immaterial and therefore have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency futures or options in the future 
interest rate risk at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market accounts  government agency bonds and municipal bonds 
the cash  cash equivalents and investments were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the amount of interest expense we must pay under our revolving credit facility 
the advances under this credit facility bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the lender s prime rate or libor 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility
