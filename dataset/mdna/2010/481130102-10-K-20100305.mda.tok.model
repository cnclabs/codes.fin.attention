table of contents overview our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance 
our reportable business segments are i publishing  ii broadcasting  iii printing services  and iv other 
our publishing segment consists of the milwaukee journal sentinel  which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the milwaukee metropolitan area  and community newspapers and shoppers in wisconsin and florida 
our broadcasting segment consists of radio stations and television stations in states and the operation of a television station under a local marketing agreement 
our interactive media assets build on our strong publishing and broadcasting brands 
we also provide a wide range of commercial printing services  including printing of publications  professional journals and documentation material  through our printing services segment 
our other segment consists of corporate expenses and eliminations and  historically  included a direct marketing services business until we sold this business in february over the past few years  fundamentals in the newspaper industry have deteriorated significantly 
continuing weakness in the automobile industry has resulted in a decline in automotive advertising 
reductions in retail and classified run of press rop advertising due in part to department store consolidation  weakened employment and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the internet  circulation declines and online competition have also negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues 
additionally  the continued housing market downturn has adversely impacted the newspaper industry  including real estate classified advertising as well as the home improvement  furniture and financial services advertising categories 
these conditions  coupled with a weak economy  persisted in our publishing businesses continued to be challenged in due to the difficult economic environment and the secular and cyclical influences affecting the newspaper industry 
we have seen advertisers reduce their advertising spending in virtually all revenue categories 
in addition  due to the changing mix of revenue categories  frequency and placement of advertising in the newspaper and customer choices to reduce or eliminate the use of color in their ads  we have seen a decrease in the average rate per inch of advertising 
classified advertising revenue  specifically for employment  real estate and automotive  decreased in compared to retail advertising also decreased in compared to with weakness in a number of consumer driven categories  including the furniture and furnishings  dining and entertainment  finance insurance  home improvement  health services  department stores  small retailers  automotive  food  business services  real estate  communications and airline and travel

com 
our publishing businesses remained profitable in despite recording million in workforce reduction charges 
notwithstanding these challenges  our publishing businesses continue to reduce their expense platforms to better align with a reduced revenue base 
total expenses decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to a decrease of million in payroll related costs  a non cash goodwill impairment of million in and a decrease of million in newsprint and paper costs 
revenues in the broadcast industry are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political and issue advertisers and  to a lesser extent  from barter  digital revenues  retransmission fees  network compensation and other revenues 
because television and radio broadcasters rely upon advertising revenue  they are subject to cyclical changes in the economy 
the size of advertisers budgets  which are affected by broad economic trends  affects the radio industry in general and the revenue of individual television stations  in particular 
the broadcast industry continues to experience softness in television and radio advertising resulting from general economic pressure now impacting local and national economies  primarily in the automobile  housing and retail segments 
our broadcasting business also is affected by audience fragmentation as audiences have an increasing number of options to access news and other programming 

table of contents revenue from broadcasting decreased in compared to due to decreases in local  political and issue  national and olympic advertising revenue  partially offset by an increase in retransmission revenue and revenue from the television stations acquired in and the difficult economic environment has negatively impacted our broadcasting advertising revenue across most categories  the most significant being our largest revenue category automotive

revenue at our direct marketing services business decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in mailing services and postage revenue 
our direct marketing services business posted an operating loss in primarily due to the operating earnings impact of the decrease in revenue and a million fixed asset impairment charge  partially offset by a decrease in production and payroll related costs 
for all of our advertising based businesses  we believe that as the current economic environment improves  advertising revenue will begin to stabilize and eventually increase from its current level 
we do not expect  however  that revenues at our daily newspaper will return to revenue levels reported in the last five years given the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry 
subsequent events on february   we completed the sale of certain assets of the st 
paul  minnesota based mailing services operations of our direct marketing services business to impact mailing of minnesota  inc for cash and a commission on buyer s future revenue for a period of three years

newspaper classified advertising also has been the most impacted by secular changes affecting the newspaper industry

television advertising revenue and rates in even numbered years typically benefit from political and issue and advertising because there tends to be more pressure on available inventory as the demand for advertising increases and we have the opportunity to increase the average unit rates we charge our customers

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash balances were million at december  we believe our expected cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facility will meet our needs for the next twelve months 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on june  the interest rate on borrowings is either libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage  or the base rate  which equals the higher of the prime rate set by us bank  us or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
at december  and december   we had borrowings of million and million  respectively  under the facility at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities was used primarily to decrease our borrowings during fees in connection with the facility of million are being amortized over the term of the facility using the straight line method 
the facility includes the following two financial covenants  which remain constant over the term of the agreement a consolidated funded debt ratio of not greater than to  as determined for the four fiscal quarter period preceding the date of determination 
this ratio compares  for any period  our funded debt to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted for non operational impairment charges recorded as a result of applying the fasb s guidance for impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization 
as of december   our consolidated funded debt ratio was to  resulting in a current maximum borrowing capacity of million 
our future borrowing capacity is subject to change due to changes in our future operating results 
an interest coverage ratio of not less than to  as determined for the four fiscal quarter period preceding the date of determination 
this ratio compares  for any period  our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as adjusted for non operational impairment charges recorded as a result of applying the fasb s guidance for impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization to our interest expense 
as of december   our interest coverage ratio was to although our unsecured revolving credit facility is not up for renewal until june   we are beginning preliminary discussions with our relationship banks to explore our options  including optimal timing  particularly given the current conditions in the credit markets 
we are evaluating our future credit needs and if there is an opportunity to exchange a portion of our expected funding requirements for a fixed term amount at a competitive fixed interest rate prior to the end of our agreement  we will consider it 
we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings loss excluding gain from discontinued operations  net  provision benefit for income taxes  total other expense  net which is entirely comprised of interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization and  if any  non cash impairment charges 
this calculation of adjusted ebitda  as defined in our credit facility  is used in our two financial covenants 
management primarily uses adjusted ebitda to monitor our borrowing capacity  a key component to our overall liquidity 
management also uses adjusted ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and or prior years and its impact on our borrowing capacity and to value prospective acquisitions 
we believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and our lenders  helps to improve their ability to understand our operating performance and our borrowing capacity and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
adjusted ebitda is also a primary measure used externally by our investors and our peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in the industry 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
adjusted ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies 

table of contents the following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net earnings to consolidated adjusted ebitda for  and dollars in millions net earnings loss earnings from discontinued operations  net provision benefit for income taxes total other expense  net depreciation amortization goodwill and broadcast license impairment adjusted ebitda we expect to be able to continue to pay down debt over the next months and to stay within our debt covenants 
our ability to remain in compliance with these financial covenants may be impacted by a number of factors  including our ability to continue to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows  as well as interest rates and other risks and uncertainties set forth in item a 
risk factors 
if it is determined we are not in compliance with these financial covenants  the lenders in our credit facility syndicate will be entitled to take certain actions  including acceleration of all amounts due under the facility 
if actual operating and cash flow results over the next months are lower than expected  the margins by which we will comply with the covenants will decrease 
in such case  we may seek to amend or replace our current credit facility with one or more capital sources on appropriate terms 
if we were unable to remain in compliance with these covenants or to amend or replace our current facility on appropriate terms  we could face increased pressure to reduce or delay capital expenditures  dispose of assets or operations  further reduce the size of our workforce or take other steps to revise our capital structure or our business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will have the ability to take any of these actions or that these actions would be successful 
given the difficult economic environment  one or more of the lenders in our credit facility syndicate could fail or be unable to fund future draws thereunder or take other positions adverse to us 
in such an event  our liquidity could be severely constrained with an adverse impact on our ability to operate our businesses and we may be forced to take the actions described above 
we continue to monitor the financial status of our current lenders and compliance with our credit agreement terms and are working on possible strategies in the event one or more of our lenders is unable or unwilling to fund future demands

cash flow continuing operations in  our primary intention for the use of our cash was to reduce our debt

we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment patterns and terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all 
table of contents other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
an evaluation of impairment of our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles was performed in and we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of certain equipment and a building 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment in the future 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses accounted for and of total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
the interim and annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses in accordance with the fasb s guidance for goodwill and intangible assets require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our reporting units  we determined fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flows were then discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value was estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach was based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to derive fair value 
each approach was weighted equally to determine a fair value estimate of each reporting unit 
we based our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information  which are unobservable level inputs per the fasb s fair value hierarchy and for which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our total company and our reporting units requires inputs and assumptions ie market growth  operating profit margins  and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
the current economic downturn has negatively impacted many of those inputs and assumptions 
if expected cash flows of our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit continues to deteriorate and management concludes expected cash flows will not improve within a reasonable period of time  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we used an income approach to estimate fair value 
the fair value estimates of our broadcast licenses contain significant assumptions incorporating 
table of contents variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance using industry normalized information for an average station within a market with the type of signal that each subject station produces 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market  including market population  household income and retail sales  market share and profit margins of an average station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates or a decrease in projected market revenues could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were million and million  respectively 
we deduct broadcast licenses and tax deductible goodwill over a period of years from the date of acquisition 
the non cash goodwill and broadcast license impairment charges recorded during and the non cash broadcast license impairment charge recorded in are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and have caused us to recognize deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize a tax benefit for our of our deferred tax assets and we believe that they will be utilized to offset future taxable income over the next years in accordance with current income tax law 
in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we have future operating losses or reductions in our expected future profitability which would cause us to believe we would be unable to utilize them 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 
there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  
table of contents the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in effect on pension benefit obligation as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the other postretirement benefit plans  we studied our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
we study historical markets to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets 
we preserved the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
the discount rate and medical cost inflation assumptions could have a significant effect on our other postretirement benefits obligations 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than less than effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of december
