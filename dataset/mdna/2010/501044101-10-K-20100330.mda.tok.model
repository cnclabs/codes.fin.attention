item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business the kroger co 
was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nation s largest retailers  as measured by revenue  operating  supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including kroger  ralphs  fred meyer  food less  king soopers  smith s  fry s  fry s marketplace  dillons  qfc and city market 
of these stores  have fuel centers 
we also operate convenience stores and fine jewelry stores 
kroger operates manufacturing plants  primarily bakeries and dairies  which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 
our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores 
we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers 
such costs include procurement and distribution costs  facility occupancy and operational costs  and overhead expenses 
our operations are reported as a single reportable segment the retail sale of merchandise to individual customers 
our performance by focusing on the customer through our customer st strategy  we were able to report solid results in excluding the non cash asset impairment charges totaling billion  pre tax billion  after tax  related to our division in southern california during what continues to be a difficult operating environment 
in  our identical supermarket sales increased  excluding fuel 
our earnings were per diluted share or per diluted share  excluding the non cash asset impairment charges referred to above 
we did not achieve our original goals for identical supermarket sales growth of to and earnings per share of to per diluted share  as cautious consumers  significant deflation  and intense competition affected margins and sales growth 
nonetheless  we strengthened our overall competitive position by increasing the number of households that are loyal to kroger and we are earning a greater share of their business 
as a result  we continue to generate tonnage growth in both perishable and non perishable categories that is among the strongest in the industry 
sustainable identical sales and earnings growth remains one of our key long term objectives 
we continue to widen the gap between our identical supermarkets sales growth trends and those of several of our competitors 
we believe this has extremely positive implications for our associates  customers and shareholders now and as we grow our business in the future 
market share is an important part of our long term strategy 
market share is important to us because it allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base 
our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share 
based on nielsen homescan data  our estimated market share increased in total by approximately basis points in across the divisions in which we operate 
nielsen homescan data includes scanned products across many retail channels  not including restaurants 
this information also indicates that our market share increased in of the divisions  declined in three  and remained unchanged in one 
these market share results are consistent with our long term strategy 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods 
net earnings net earnings totaled million for  compared to net earnings totaling billion in each of and the net earnings for include non cash asset impairment charges totaling billion  after tax  related to a division in southern california the non cash impairment charges 
the impairment primarily resulted from the write off of the ralphs division goodwill balance 
excluding these impairment charges  adjusted net earnings for the year would have been billion 
additionally  the decrease in net earnings for  compared to  resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit  partially offset by a lifo charge of million pre tax  compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in net earnings also included after tax costs of million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike 
the slight increase in our net earnings for  compared to  resulted from strong non fuel identical supermarket sales growth and strong fuel results 
management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share in are useful metrics to investors and analysts because impairment charges are non recurring  non cash charges that are not directly related to our day to day business 
we also excluded these charges from our incentive plan calculations for the year 
earnings per diluted share totaled and adjusted earnings per diluted share totaled  compared to in  or  excluding the 
per diluted share for costs for damage and disruption caused by hurricane ike  and in the decline in adjusted net earnings per share in  compared to  resulted from lower retail fuel margins and decreased operating profit  partially offset by lower lifo charges and after tax costs of million from disruption and damage caused by hurricane ike in our earnings per share growth in  compared to  resulted from increased net earnings  strong identical sales growth and the repurchase of kroger stock 
sales total sales in millions percentage increase percentage increase total supermarket sales without fuel total supermarket fuel sales total supermarket sales other sales total sales other sales primarily relate to sales at convenience stores  including fuel  jewelry stores  sales by our manufacturing plants to outside customers  and variable interest entities 
the slight increase in total sales and the decrease in other sales and total supermarket fuel sales for compared to was attributable to the year over year decline in retail fuel prices 
the change in our total supermarket sales without fuel for over was primarily the result of increases in identical supermarket sales and retail square footage 
identical supermarket sales  excluding fuel  increased due to increased transaction count offset partially by a lower average sale per shopping trip 
we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters 
fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below 
differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage 
identical supermarket sales include all sales at identical fred meyer multi department stores 
we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales 
our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below  based on the week period of  compared to the week period of the previous year 
the identical store count in the table below represents the total number of identical supermarkets as of january  and january  identical supermarket sales dollars in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers identical th quarter store count we define a supermarket as comparable when it has been in operation for five full quarters  including expansions and relocations 
as is the case for identical supermarket sales  fuel center discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket comparable sales results calculations illustrated below 
comparable supermarket sales include all sales at comparable fred meyer multi department stores 
we calculate annualized comparable supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of comparable sales 
our annualized comparable supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below  based on the week period of  compared to the same week period of the previous year 
the comparable store count in the table below represents the total number of comparable supermarkets as of january  and january  comparable supermarket sales dollars in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers comparable th quarter store count fifo gross margin we calculate first in  first out fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs  including advertising  warehousing and transportation  but excluding the last in  first out lifo charge 
merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expense 
fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 
our fifo gross margin rates  as a percentage of sales  were in  in and in our retail fuel sales reduce our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales 
excluding the effect of retail fuel operations  our fifo gross margin rates decreased basis points in and basis points in the decrease in our non fuel fifo gross margin rate since reflects our continued investments in our customer st strategy 
in addition  fifo gross margin in  compared to  decreased due to heightened competitive activity and deflation  partially offset by improvements in shrink  advertising  and warehousing and transportation expenses  as a percentage of sales 
lifo charge the lifo charge was million in  million in and million in the lifo charge in  compared to  decreased primarily due to a decrease in annualized product cost inflation for those categories of inventory on the lifo method of valuation for compared to the last three quarters of experienced product cost deflation  excluding fuel 
in  our lifo charge primarily resulted from product cost inflation related to tobacco products and pharmacy 
an increase in product cost inflation caused the increase in the lifo charge in  compared to we revised our lifo charge by million pre tax million after tax 
this revision was made to account for certain promotional allowances in our lifo indices in we believe this adjustment is not material to any individual year or any quarterly period within such years presented 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative og a expenses consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages  health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs  utilities and credit card fees 
rent expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and interest expense are not included in og a 
og a expenses  as a percentage of sales  were in  in and in the growth in our retail fuel sales reduces our og a rate due to the very low og a rate on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales 
og a expenses  as a percentage of sales excluding fuel  decreased basis points in  compared to og a expenses  as a percentage of sales excluding fuel and the effect of hurricane ike in  decreased basis points in  compared to the decrease  compared to  resulted primarily from increased supermarket identical sales growth  a reduction in bag expense  lower incentive compensation  and reduced utility costs 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in credit card fees  health care costs  and wages 
wage expenses have increased due to increased hours worked and lower employee turnover  in the current economic environment  which has resulted in increased average hourly wages 
the decrease in our og a rate in  excluding the effect of retail fuel and the effect of hurricane ike in  compared to  was primarily the result of increased identical supermarkets sales growth and a settlement received from credit card processers  partially offset by increases in credit card fees and health care costs 
rent expense rent expense was million in  as compared to million in and million in rent expense  as a percentage of sales  was in  as compared to in and in the decrease in rent expense  as a percentage of sales  reflects our continued emphasis on owning rather than leasing  whenever possible 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was billion in and billion in and the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in  compared to and  was the result of additional depreciation on capital expenditures  including prior acquisitions and the prior purchase of leased facilities  totaling billion in  billion in and billion in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of sales  was in  in and in the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense in  compared to  as a percentage of sales  is primarily due to increased depreciation expense  and a slower growth rate in sales due to heightened competitive activity  deflation and year over year decline in retail fuel prices 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in  compared to  as a percentage of sales  is primarily the result of increasing sales 
interest expense net interest expense totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in  compared to  resulted primarily from a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in interest income  offset partially by our benefit from interest rate swaps 
the increase in interest expense in  compared to  was primarily the result of an increase in the average total debt balance for the year  partially offset by interest income related to the mark to market of ineffective fair value swaps 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  in and in the effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge being mostly non deductible for tax purposes 
excluding the non cash impairment charges  our effective rate in was 
the and effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
in addition  the effective tax rates for and differ from the expected federal statutory rate due to the resolution of some tax issues with the taxing authorities 
common stock repurchase program we maintain stock repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule b and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common stock  from time to time 
we made open market purchases of kroger stock totaling million in  million in and billion in under these repurchase programs 
in addition to these repurchase programs  in december we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  and the tax benefit from these exercises 
we repurchased approximately million in  million in and million in of kroger stock under the stock option program 
in and  to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility  we reduced the amount of stock repurchased during the year  decreasing the cash used for stock purchases in and  compared to capital expenditures capital expenditures  including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions and the purchase of leased facilities  totaled billion in compared to billion in and the increase in capital spending in compared to and was the result of increasing our focus on merchandising and productivity projects 
during  capital expenditures for the purchase of leased facilities totaled million compared to million for this increase was due to kroger purchasing several previously leased retail stores  one office building and one distribution center at very attractive rates during the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
the liabilities represent our best estimate  using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods  of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january  we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 
for both workers compensation and general liability claims  we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million 
general liability claims are not discounted 
we are also similarly self insured for property related losses 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to losses in excess of million on a per claim basis  except in the case of an earthquake  for which stop loss coverage is in excess of million per claim  up to million per claim in california and million outside of california 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs 
our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  we perform an impairment calculation  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value 
fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in  million in and million in included in the amount are asset impairments recorded totaling million for a southern california reporting unit 
we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating  general and administrative expense 
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level  could produce significantly different results 
goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of january  we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of triggering events 
we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities with goodwill balances 
fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
we base projected future cash flows on management s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future 
if we identify potential for impairment  we measure the fair value of a division against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
in the third quarter of  our operating performance suffered due to persistent deflation and intense competition 
based on our revised forecast  during the third quarter of  and the initial results of our annual budget process for the supermarket reporting units  management believed that there were circumstances evident to warrant impairment testing at these reporting units 
we did not test for impairment our variable interest entities with recorded goodwill balances as no triggering event occurred 
the ralphs reporting unit in southern california was the only reporting unit for which there was a potential impairment 
the operating performance of the ralphs reporting unit was significantly affected by economic conditions and responses to competitive actions in southern california 
as a result of this decline in current and future expected cash flows  along with comparable fair value information  management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for the ralphs reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
subsequent to the impairment  no goodwill remains at the ralphs reporting unit 
management used an equal weighting of discounted cash flows and a sales weighted ebitda multiple to estimate fair value 
the discounted cash flows assume long term sales growth rates comparable to historical performances and a discount rate of 
in addition  the ebitda multiples observed in the marketplace declined since those used in the january  assessment 
we performed our annual assessment in the fourth quarter for all supermarket and variable interest entity vie reporting units with goodwill balances 
based on current and future expected cash flows  we believe additional goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible 
a reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our remaining goodwill balance  except for one supermarket reporting unit and one vie reporting unit with recorded goodwill of million and million  respectively 
for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative estimates and assumptions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level  could produce significantly different results 
the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation  business valuations in the market  the economy and market competition 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions 
we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value 
we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings  if any  in merchandise costs 
we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 
post retirement benefit plans a company sponsored defined benefit pension plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap  which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet 
we record  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  actuarial gains or losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 
we adopted the measurement date provisions of gaap effective february  the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a december measurement date 
all plans are measured as of our fiscal year end 
the non cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of gaap decreased shareowners equity by approximately million million after tax and increased long term liabilities by approximately million 
there was no effect on our results of operations 
the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions  including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets  may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making this determination  we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans 
our methodology for selecting the discount rates as of year end was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits  respectively  represent the equivalent single rates constructed under a broad market aa yield curve 
we utilized a discount rate of for year end for both pension and other benefits 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of january   by approximately million 
to determine the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories 
for and  we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 
our pension plan s average return was for the calendar years ended december   net of all investment management fees and expenses 
the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december   net of investment management fees and expenses  increased  primarily due to the strength of the market in we believe our pension return assumption is appropriate 
for the past years  our average annual return has been 
the average annual return for the s p over the same period of time has been 
in addition  forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations indicate an return assumption is reasonable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 
percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets we contributed million in  million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans 
although we are not required to make cash contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during  we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans in additional contributions may be made if required under the pension protection act to avoid any benefit restrictions 
we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
we contributed and expensed million in  million in and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts 
the k retirement savings account plan provides to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions  plan compensation  and length of service 
b multi employer plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from most of our collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose 
trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions 
the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded  in accordance with gaap 
we made contributions to these plans  and recognized expense  of million in  million in and million in based on the most recent information available to us  we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most or all of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits 
we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets  ie  the amount of underfunding  as of december  because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans  we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger s share of the underfunding 
nonetheless  the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer 
as of december   we estimate that kroger s share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was billion  pre tax  or billion  after tax 
this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of million  pre tax  or million  after tax  as of december   compared to december  the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the strength of the market during the last year and benefit reductions 
our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others  and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 
our estimate is imprecise and not necessarily reliable 
we have made and disclosed this estimate not because this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger 
rather  we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences 
in  our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately since in  we expect to contribute approximately million to our multi employer pension plans  subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
based on current market conditions  we expect meaningful increases in funding and in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years  but we believe it is unlikely that contributions will double during that period  which is a change from our estimate at year end finally  underfunding means that  in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds  we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability 
any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with gaap 
the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations  returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments 
the amount could decline  and kroger s future expense would be favorably affected  if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or favorable legislation 
on the other hand  kroger s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline  if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or adverse legislation 
deferred rent we recognize rent holidays  including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements  as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
uncertain tax positions effective february   we adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
these standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
these standards also provide guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record allowances for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which an allowance has been established  is audited and fully resolved 
as of january   the most recent examination concluded by the internal revenue service covered the years through the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions 
share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january   as well as all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award 
in addition  we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award  over the period the award restrictions lapse 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately in and in of inventories were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at january   and by million at january  we follow the link chain  dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 
we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 
we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold 
in most cases  vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item  and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item 
when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item  we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold 
we recognized approximately billion in  billion in and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs 
all years presented now include amounts for certain vendor allowances related to directed store deliveries 
we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operations in and compared to billion in the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including noncontrolling interests adjusted primarily for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization  goodwill impairment charge  and changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we realized an increase in cash of million in and decreases in cash of million in and million in from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in the change in operating assets and liabilities in  compared to  is primarily due to an increase in the changes of income taxes receivable and payable  accounts payable and inventories  offset partially by decreases in the changes of deposits in transit and prepaid expenses 
the decrease in the change in operating assets and liabilities in  compared to  is primarily due to a decrease in the change in income taxes receivable and payable 
these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling million in  million in and million in the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in  compared to and  because we applied our overpayment of income taxes to current year taxes 
the overpayment resulted primarily from accounting method changes related to asset capitalization 
net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was billion in  compared to billion in and the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in  compared to  due primarily to higher capital spending  partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions 
our use of cash for investing activities was consistent in  compared to capital expenditures  including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions  were billion in  billion in and billion in refer to the capital expenditures section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 
net cash used by financing activities financing activities used million of cash in compared to million in and million in the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in  compared to  was primarily related to the decrease in the amount of treasury stock purchased and payments on long term debt and our credit facility  offset by decreased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and capital stock 
the increase in the amount of cash used in  compared to  was primarily a result of payments on long term debt and the bank revolver  offset by decreased stock repurchases 
we repurchased million of kroger stock in compared to million in and billion in we paid dividends totaling million in  million in and million in debt management total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations  decreased million to billion as of year end  compared to year end the decrease in  compared to  resulted from the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  offset by payment at maturity of our million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  decreased outstanding commercial paper and payments on our money market lines 
total debt decreased million to billion as of year end  compared to year end the decrease in  compared to  resulted from the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  offset by decreased commercial paper  the payments on the bank revolver  the repayment of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of that came due in our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges on our fixed rate debt 
we had prefunded employee benefit costs of million in each of the three years ended  and the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million in and million in factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our a p f rated commercial paper cp program 
at january   we did not have any cp borrowings outstanding 
cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility 
if our credit rating declines below its current level of bbb baa bbb  the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating and lower the amount we are able to borrow on a daily basis under our cp program 
this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 
our credit facility also requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants 
a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
these financial covenants and ratios are described below our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense  as defined in the credit facility was to as of january  our current borrowing rates are determined from the better of our applicable percentage ratio or our credit ratings as defined by the credit facility 
our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facility was to as of january  if this ratio exceeded to  we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 
our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense  as defined in the credit facility was to as of january  if this ratio fell below to  we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 
consolidated ebitda  as defined in our credit facility  includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our non cash asset impairment charge related to goodwill in our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  based on year of maturity or settlement  as of january  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations low income housing obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans  which totaled million in we adopted new standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on february  see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding this adoption 
the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 
we did not have any borrowings under our credit facility as of january  amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of january   and stated fixed and swapped interest rates  if applicable  for all other debt instruments 
the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability have been stated on a present value basis 
our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction 
these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of january   we maintained a billion  five year revolving credit facility that  unless extended  terminates in outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings  and some outstanding letters of credit  reduce funds available under the credit agreement 
in addition to the credit agreement  we maintained three uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate 
the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement 
as of january   we had no borrowings under our credit agreement  money market lines or outstanding commercial paper 
the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of january  in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of january   we had authorized for issuance million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december  we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of  or access to  such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we would issue letters of credit  in states where allowed  against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and some of our subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a ownership interest 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness  should the entities be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we have also agreed to guarantee  up to million  the indebtedness of an entity in which we have a ownership interest 
our share of the responsibility  as of january   should the entity be unable to meet its obligations  totals approximately million and is collateralized by approximately million of inventory located in our stores 
we consolidate this entity because we are the primary beneficiary  and therefore the entire million is a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses  including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 
in addition to the above  we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business 
such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger  indemnities related to the sale of our securities  indemnities of directors  officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work  and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans 
while kroger s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 
recently adopted accounting standards in december  the fasb amended its existing standards to provide additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans 
the new standards require disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made  the fair value of each major category of plan assets  valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets  the effect of measurements on changes in plan assets when using significant unobservable inputs and significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets 
the new standards become effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the amended standards effective january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the new required disclosures 
effective may   we adopted new standards for subsequent events 
the purpose of the new standards is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the new required disclosures 
effective may   we adopted new standards that effect the accounting and disclosures related to certain financial instruments including a providing additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased  b identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly  c amending the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements  and d requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments on an interim basis in addition to the annual disclosure requirements 
the new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these new standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effective february   we adopted the new standards that require enhanced disclosures on an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
the new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective february   we adopted the new standards that clarify that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of its adoption 
effective february   we adopted new standards related to business combinations 
the new standards expand the definitions of a business and the fair value measurement and reporting in a business combination 
all business combinations completed after february   will be accounted for under the new standards 
effective february   we adopted new standards that deferred the fair value disclosures for most non financial assets and non financial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new standards 
in december  the fasb amended its existing standards for a parent s noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to the subsidiary 
the new standard defines a noncontrolling interest  previously called a minority interest  as the portion of equity in a subsidiary that is not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the new standard requires  among other things  that a noncontrolling interest be clearly identified  labeled and presented in the consolidated balance sheet as equity  but separate from the parent s equity  that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  and that if a subsidiary is deconsolidated  the parent measure at fair value any noncontrolling equity investment that the parent retains in the former subsidiary and recognize a gain or loss in net income based on the fair value of the non controlling equity investment 
we adopted the new standard effective february   and applied it retrospectively 
as a result  we reclassified noncontrolling interests in amounts of from the mezzanine section to equity in the january  consolidated balance sheet 
certain reclassifications to the consolidated statements of operations have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard 
recorded amounts for prior periods previously presented as net earnings  which are now presented as net earnings attributable to the kroger co  have not changed as a result of the adoption of the new standard 
effective january   we adopted the amended standards related to disclosures about interests in vies 
these amended standards require additional disclosures about an entity s involvement with vies and transfers of financial assets 
the adoption of these new amended standards did not change any disclosures in our consolidated financial statements due to our vies being immaterial 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb amended its existing standards to change how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the new standards will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january  while we are still finalizing the evaluation of the impact of these amended standards on our consolidated financial statements  we believe these new standards will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that amends and clarifies existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of level and level and reasons for such transfers  and the separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlement in the level reconciliation 
it also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for our first quarter of  except for the new disclosures in the level reconciliation 
the level disclosures are effective for our first quarter of we do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co  identical supermarket sales growth  expected product cost  expected pension plan contributions  our ability to generate operating cash flow  projected capital expenditures  square footage growth  opportunities to reduce costs  cash flow requirements  and our operating plan for the future  and are indicated by words such as comfortable  committed  will  expect  goal  should  intend  target  believe  anticipate  plan  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 
we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for we expect identical supermarket sales growth  excluding fuel sales  of in for  we will continue to focus on driving sales growth and balancing investments in gross margin and improved customer service to provide a better shopping experience for our customers 
we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions 
we expect non fuel operating margins to have a slight reduction to a slight improvement in rate in  from  excluding the non cash impairment charges recorded 
for  we expect fuel margins  which can be highly volatile  to be approximately per gallon  and we expect continued strong growth in fuel gallons sold 
for  we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million 
this forecast is based on cost changes for products in our inventory 
we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments  to maintain our current debt coverage ratios  and to pay cash dividends 
as market conditions change  we plan to re evaluate the above uses of cash flow and our stock repurchase activity 
we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion  as well as focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels 
in addition  we will continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology is focused on improving store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  and should reduce merchandising costs 
we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements 
we expect capital investments for to be in the range of billion  excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities 
we expect total food store square footage to grow approximately before acquisitions and operational closings 
we expect to reduce our internal capital plans by approximately billion in total over the next three fiscal years 
our original internal capital plans projected year over year continued capital expenditure growth 
we now expect capital expenditures to average under billion a year over the next three years 
based on current operating trends  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we believe we have adequate sources of cash  if needed  under our credit agreement 
we expect that our og a results will be affected by increased costs  such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees  offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately 
we expect rent expense  as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity  will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 
we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration  productivity improvements  shrink  warehousing and transportation 
these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 
although we are not required to make cash contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during  we expect to contribute approximately million to these plans in we expect any elective contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
we expect expense for company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately million 
in addition  we expect our cash contributions and expense to the k retirement savings account plan from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in  compared to we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans in  subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
in addition  we expect meaningful increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next five years  but we believe it unlikely that contributions will double during that period  which is a change from our estimate at year end we expect bad debt expense from the credit extended to our customers through our company branded credit card in to be approximately million 
we believe no additional goodwill impairments will be reasonably possible in we have various labor agreements that will be negotiated in  covering store employees in albuquerque  cincinnati  dallas  detroit  ft 
wayne  houston  little rock  portland  seattle and toledo 
we will also negotiate agreements with the teamsters for employees in california and portland 
upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements  work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 
in all of these contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates 
our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit  including our bank credit facilities  could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us 
if market conditions change  it could affect our cash flow 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor disputes  industry consolidation  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including interest rates and the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities  manufacturing commodity costs  diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations  trends in consumer spending  the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions  stock repurchases  and the success of our future growth plans 
the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments  as well as operating conditions  including persistent deflation  increased competitive activity  and cautious spending behavior of our customers 
our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions  weather  availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging  and other factors beyond our control 
our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt  our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated  and our failure to generate expected earnings 
the timing of our recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by changes in product costs during the year 
if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities  an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing 
our operating margins  without fuel  could decline more than expected if we are unable to pass on any cost increases  fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations 
we could fail to realize our expected operating margin per gallon of fuel and fuel gallons sold based upon changes in the price of fuel or a change in our operating costs 
we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business  as well as to the material litigation facing kroger  and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable 
unexpected outcomes in these matters  however  could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business  either favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
rent expense  which includes subtenant rental income  could be adversely affected by the state of the economy  increased store closure activity and future consolidation 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or the remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed 
our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws  the status of pending items with various taxing authorities and the deductibility of certain expenses 
the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants  savings rate  plan compensation  and length of service of participants 
our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could increase more than anticipated 
should asset values in these funds deteriorate  if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability  or should our estimates prove to be understated  our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated 
if weakness in the financial markets continues or worsens  our contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated 
changes in laws or regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth  and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate  may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base 
since gasoline generates low profit margins  we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 
although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin  gasoline sales provide a positive effect on og a expense as a percentage of sales 
our capital expenditures  expected square footage growth  and number of store projects completed over the next three fiscal years could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted  if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget or if current operating conditions fail to improve or worsen 
interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment  changes in the company s credit ratings  fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt  decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt 
impairment losses  including goodwill  could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows  market values or business valuations in the market 
our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment  real estate market values  competitive activity  inflation and customer behavior 
our estimated expense and obligation for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers  our fifo gross margin and net earnings would suffer 
earnings and sales also may be affected by adverse weather conditions  particularly to the extent that hurricanes  tornadoes  floods  earthquakes  and other conditions disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers  create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities  or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations  including the cost of transportation 
other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in  contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of january   we maintained interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling billion  to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
these agreements mature at varying times between april and april  and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 
as of january   other long term assets totaling million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements  offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 
we have unamortized proceeds from twelve interest rate swaps once classified as fair value hedges totaling approximately million 
the unamortized proceeds are recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt 
in addition to the interest rate swaps noted above  in we entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount totaling million 
a forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future benchmark interest rates on debt for an established period of time 
we entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock into fixed interest rates on forecasted issuances of debt in and in  we terminated two of these forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
in  we terminated the remaining forward interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
as of january   the unamortized payments and proceeds of million million net of tax on these terminated forward starting interest rate swaps have been recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to earnings as the payments of interest to which the hedge relates are made 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january  the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january  interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january  refer to notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate average notional amounts outstanding january  january  fair thereafter total value in millions interest rate derivatives fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  warehouses  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases
