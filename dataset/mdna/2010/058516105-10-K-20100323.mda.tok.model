overview we are a manufacturer  distributor and service provider for the theatre exhibition industry on a worldwide basis 
we also design  develop  manufacture and distribute lighting systems to the worldwide entertainment lighting industry through our strong entertainment lighting segment 
we have two primary reportable core operating segments theatre and lighting 
approximately of fiscal year sales were from theatre products and approximately were lighting products 
additional information related to our reporting segments can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenues gross profit selling and administrative expenses income loss from operations net earnings loss from continuing operations amounts exclude goodwill impairment charges of  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  revenues net revenues during the twelve months ended december  rose to million from million in twelve months ended december  theatre products services total theatre revenues lighting other total net revenues theatre segment sales of theatre products and services increased to million in from million in digital product sales sales of digital products rose to million from million in as the industry change to digital projection equipment began to accelerate during we believe the increased demand resulted from movie exhibitors wanting to show movies in d digital format as they believed that d movies result in higher box office receipts 
we believe the demand for digital equipment will continue to increase not only for the d benefits but also for such potential benefits as additional advertising and being able to project more alternative entertainment at the movie theatres 
the majority of the increase in digital sales resulted from sales of digital projectors  however  sales of digital lamps also rose from million in to million in film product sales sales of film projection equipment declined to million in from million a year ago due to the theatre exhibition industry s transition to digital based systems discussed above  coupled with a slowdown in new theatre construction in the united states and worldwide largely due to the current economic and credit market conditions 
included in film equipment revenues were sales of used film equipment which amounted to million compared to million a year ago 
these used units were obtained from theatre chains which have converted their film auditoriums to digital and had no further use for the film projectors 
we see a short term opportunity to buy and resell these units as they become available and which are in a suitable condition for us to be able to refurbish them in a profitable manner 
we believe the decrease in used equipment sales during pertains to the lack of quality used equipment currently in the market 
we do expect used equipment sales to increase once the exhibitors begin to change out entire movie theatre complexes from film to digital 
we also expect these changes to significantly affect sales of new film equipment sales which are expected to decline in and beyond 
sales of replacement parts declined to million during from million during we expect sales of film replacement parts to decrease over time but the decline is expected to be at a slower pace compared to the film projectors themselves as the equipment will require maintenance up 
table of contents to the point they are replaced by a digital unit 
however  we are unsure how the used equipment market will impact our replacement part sales when film equipment is replaced during the full digital cinema rollout 
sales of film lenses were comparable to a year ago at million 
sales of xenon lamps were also flat compared to a year ago at million 
as with replacement parts  the decline in sales of film lenses and lamps  due to the digital rollout is expected to be at a slower pace compared to film projectors 
however  unlike replacement part sales  we do not expect the used equipment market to significantly impact the sale of lamps 
screen product sales we generated screen sales of million in compared to million a year ago 
sales were at record levels for this product line due to higher demand for the special silver screens needed for certain digital d applications 
as discussed earlier  this demand is resulting from our customers wanting to show certain movies in digital d and also more d movies being available from the hollywood studios 
in addition  sales of large format screens to imax were higher than a year ago 
we sell screens for both digital cinema and film applications 
in some instances  a screen can be used interchangeably with either a digital projector or a film projector 
however  there are certain digital d applications such as the technology by reald that require special silver screens that we manufacture and which  as discussed earlier  are driving the growth of the product line 
service revenues service revenues increased in to million from million a year ago due to an increase in digital projectors being sold in the industry 
lighting segment sales of lighting products fell to million during from million in sales of follow spotlights fell to million from million a year ago 
sale of skytrackers fell to million from million in  while replacement part sales fell from million in to million in sales of all other lighting products  including but not limited to xenon lamps  britelights and nocturns amounted to million in compared to million in lighting products have been impacted by the effects of the troubled credit markets as a significant portion of the business is dependant on the construction or improvements of stadiums and auditoriums around the world 
export revenues sales outside the united states mainly theatre sales increased to million in from million in resulting primarily from increased sales in china where sales increased from million in to million in sales into mexico and south america were also higher than a year ago increasing by million and million  respectively 
sales in canada increased to million in compared to million a year ago due to an increase in d silver screens 
sales into europe reflected increased business for film products increasing to million from million a year ago 
sales into asia declined to million from million in  while sales to india declined by million compared to a year ago 
export sales are sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that can lead to volatility 
additionally  certain areas of the world are more cost conscious than the us market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers making it more difficult to generate sufficient profit to justify selling into these regions 
additionally  foreign exchange rates and excise taxes sometimes make it difficult to market our products overseas at reasonable selling prices 

table of contents gross profit consolidated gross profit increased to million in from million a year ago and as a percent of total revenue increased to from in gross profit in the theatre segment increased to million in from million in and as a percentage of theatre sales increased to from a year ago 
the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted from improved margins from our screen business 
we also cut costs from our primary manufacturing operations in omaha during margins were also higher from our service business due to revenues increasing from a year ago resulting in margins increasing million 
the current service business relates to servicing film projection equipment which is in a mature industry and at the same time  we are growing the infrastructure in anticipation of the upcoming digital cinema rollout 
this combination is resulting in the division experiencing negative margins putting pressure on our overall margin 
we expect this business to transition to servicing more digital projectors in the future when the digital cinema rollout accelerates and as a result margins should improve 
we do expect our gross margin as a percentage of revenues to decrease in the future primarily due to increased sales of digital projection equipment which carry lower margins compared to most of our other products 
however  the sales price on the digital projectors is higher than what we receive on film projectors which offsets gross margin dollars to a degree 
gross margins will also be impacted in the future by higher film manufacturing costs pertaining to lower demand for manufactured film products 
we expect to purchase film inventory components in lower quantities resulting in some raw material price increases and to experience less manufacturing throughput in the omaha plant to cover fixed overhead costs 
the timing of this is dependant on the timing of the digital cinema rollout 
the gross profit in the lighting segment amounted to million or as a percentage of revenues in compared to million or as a percentage of revenues in the results reflect lower sales levels in the segment 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased to million in compared to million in and as a percent of total revenue declined to from a year ago

we also settled an asbestos lawsuit resulting in additional legal costs of million 
we experienced higher consulting fees during the year pertaining to the board of directors performing a search for the successor to the current chief executive officer before his scheduled retirement date at the end of fiscal year management also achieved more targets under the company s bonus plan resulting in higher bonus expenses compared to a year ago 
stock compensation expenses rose due to the company having more unvested restricted stock as opposed to a year ago 
we first began granting restricted stock in and thus was the first full year of stock expense 
this was also coupled with more cumulative grants of restricted stock  higher stock prices and shorter vesting periods 

table of contents we did cut back in certain other administrative areas such as bank fees  audit and compliance costs 
payroll costs were also lower due to the layoffs in the first quarter of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million within our theatre and lighting segments based on an impairment analyses which took into consideration the ongoing transition taking place in our strategy and operations  moving from the manufacture of traditional film equipment to a business model focused on the distribution and service of digital projectors 
as a result of the impairment analysis performed  we determined the book value of goodwill was impaired 
no such charges took place in as we no longer have any goodwill 
other financial items during  we sold our coater and marinade product line for approximately  resulting in a net gain of approximately  the product line was sold to a former chief financial officer of the company 
our results for also reflect a loss of million pertaining to our share of equity in the loss from digital link ii  llc 
this loss compares to million a year ago and was higher due to more depreciation and interest costs resulting from additional deployments 
we recorded net interest income of million during compared to million a year ago as our investment balances were lower during due to the sale of our auction rate securities which carried much higher interest rates compared to the interest bearing cash we are currently investing in 
in addition  average interest rates were much lower on interest bearing cash and cash equivalents in general compared to the year ago period 
other income amounted to million in compared to expense of million in the results primarily reflect the impact of transaction gains arising from foreign exchange fluctuations during the year due to the us dollar decreasing versus the canadian dollar

while spotlight sales were higher during  the product line is beginning to feel the effects of the troubled credit markets as these sales are in many instances dependent on the construction of stadiums and auditoriums around the world 
it is currently unclear if certain projects will be delayed or canceled during and beyond

table of contents digital projection equipment in addition to the slowdown in new theatre construction in the united states 
during we sold million of digital equipment which we primarily distribute through a distribution agreement with nec corporation of america 
these sales compare to million a year ago 
the gross margin percentage on these sales is significantly lower than the margin we currently experience on our film projectors

our margin was also impacted by our service subsidiary 
the current service business primarily relates to servicing film projection equipment which is in a mature industry and at the same time  we are growing the infrastructure in anticipation of the upcoming digital cinema rollout 
this combination is resulting in the division experiencing negative margins putting pressure on our overall margin 
we expect this business to transition to servicing more digital projectors in the future when the digital cinema rollout accelerates

declining economic activity and the tightening of global credit markets  negatively impacts the volume of sales of our theatre projection equipment  lighting equipment and related services provided and the price we receive for these sales and services 
the analyses also took into consideration the ongoing transition taking place in our strategy and operations  moving from the manufacture of traditional film equipment to a business model focused on the distribution and service of digital projectors

a significant decrease or interruption in business from our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which we sell our products 
in addition  advancing technologies  such as digital cinema  could disrupt historical customer relationships 
financial instruments that potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable 
we sell product to a large number of customers in many different geographic regions 
to minimize credit concentration risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition or use letters of credit

table of contents seasonality generally  our business exhibits a moderate level of seasonality as sales of theatre products typically increase during the third and fourth quarters 
we believe that such increased sales reflect seasonal increases in the construction of new motion picture screens in anticipation of the holiday movie season 
legal see note to the consolidated financial statements  and item of this report  for a description of legal matters 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net revenues or profitability 
we did experience higher than normal prices on certain raw materials during the year coupled with higher freight costs as freight companies passed on a portion of higher gas and oil costs 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition ballantyne manufactures or distributes and sells projectors which are highly complex and have many components that make up a complete system  which is referred to as an integrated system 
each customer selects options for certain components in determining the integrated system they chose to purchase 
to recognize revenue  we follow the requirements of asc subtopic  revenue recognition general  which consists of determining that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectibility is reasonably assured once the customer has determined the features for their integrated system  we either manufacture or integrate the system to their preference and then ship the system when it is complete 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the third party 
in those limited situations where the shipping terms are fob destination point  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments about the credit worthiness of both current and prospective customers based on ongoing credit evaluations performed by our credit department 
these evaluations include  but are not limited to  reviewing customers prior payment history  analyzing credit applications  monitoring the aging of receivables from current customers and reviewing financial statements  if applicable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is developed based on several factors including overall customer credit quality  historical write off experience and a specific account analysis that project the ultimate collectability of the accounts 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly 
when it is determined that a customer is unlikely to pay  a charge is recorded to bad debt expense in the consolidated statements of operations and the allowance for doubtful accounts is increased 
when it becomes certain the customer cannot pay  the receivable is written off by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
at december   there were approximately million in gross outstanding receivables and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non payments 
at december   there were approximately million in gross outstanding accounts receivable and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or if one of our large customers were to declare bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and include appropriate elements of material  labor and overhead 
our policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable values are management s estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand and the development of digital technology  which could make our theatre products obsolete  among other items 
management has managed these risks in the past and believes that it can manage them in the future  however  operating margins may suffer if they are unable to effectively manage these risks 
at december  we had recorded gross inventory of approximately million and million of inventory reserves 
this compared to million and million  respectively  at december  warranty our products must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider experience with costs for replacement parts  costs of scrapping defective products  the number of product units subject to warranty claims and other direct costs associated with warranty claims 
if the cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than originally estimated  our accrued cost for warranty claims would increase

table of contents long lived assets and amortizable intangibles we review long lived assets and amortizable intangibles  exclusive of goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
our most significant long lived assets subject to these periodic assessments of recoverability are property  plant and equipment  which have a net book value of million at december  our amortizable intangibles  which are subject to recovery  consist of trademarks  customer relationships and non competition agreements and have a carrying value of million at december  because the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangibles are based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  these estimates may vary due to a number of factors  some of which may be outside of management s control 
to the extent that we are unable to achieve management s forecasts of future income  it may become necessary to record impairment losses for any excess of the net book value of property  plant and equipment or intangibles over their fair value

deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we market our products throughout the united states and the world 
as a result  we could be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic conditions 
as a majority of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar can and sometimes has made our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest rates we have a variable interest rate credit facility  however  we have no outstanding balances as of december  if we would borrow up to the maximum amount available under these facilities  a one percent increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by million per annum 
interest rate risks from our other interest related accounts such as our postretirement obligations are not deemed significant 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are primarily related to our china and canadian subsidiaries 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions 
a portion of our cash in the china and canadian subsidiaries is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million
