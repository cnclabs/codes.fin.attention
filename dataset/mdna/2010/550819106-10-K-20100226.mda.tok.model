the company s subsidiaries design and manufacture specialty engineered filtration media  industrial thermal insulating solutions  automotive thermal and acoustical barriers  temperature control equipment  medical filtration media and devices and biopharmaceutical processing components for demanding thermal acoustical  filtration separation and bio medical applications 
business environment overview the company s operating results were negatively impacted by a global economic recession and economic uncertainties 
among other factors  disruptions in the global credit and financial markets  including diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence and spending  declines in economic growth and increases in unemployment rates caused economic instability and significantly lower sales for the company 
worldwide economic cycles  and the effects on the markets in which the company operates  are difficult to predict 
during the second half of  most of the company s businesses experienced marginal improvements in the markets they serve  but the company is unable to predict the timing and extent to which lydall s markets will continue to improve during and the resulting impact on the company s financial results 
while global economic conditions negatively impacted the company s financial results in  the company took many actions during the year to maintain a strong balance sheet and prepare for the future  including the following managing cash and working capital to improve liquidity 
the company generated million in net cash flows from operating activities in  primarily by reducing inventory levels from million at december  to million at december  lydall s cash balance was million at december  compared to million at december   reducing capital expenditures by million in  compared to  while continuing to focus on executing growth strategies and investing in critical product offerings and technologies  including the focus on commercialization of a filtration membrane technology  an investment in needle glass mat equipment and growing the company s vital fluids bio medical life science business with a capital investment of million in  completing the consolidation of the north american automotive facilities  eliminating costs company wide through various actions  including reduction in workforce 
overall  selling  product development and administrative expenses were lower by approximately in compared to  executing a new domestic credit facility in march  that provides the company with credit availability to fund operations  capital investments and strategic transactions if needed 
the company had no borrowings against the facility at december   continuing lean six sigma and operational excellence initiatives in order to reduce costs  improve performance with customers and leverage synergies across the company 
operational matters performance materials segment the performance materials segment is comprised of lydall s filtration media solutions for air  fluid power  industrial and life science applications and industrial thermal insulation solutions for building products  appliances  and energy and industrial markets 
the company engages with customers to deliver value added products for their specific needs to differentiate lydall s products from competitors 
lydall s filtration and industrial thermal insulation businesses are in markets that the company believes present long term growth opportunities for lydall through the introduction of new products  expansion of share in existing markets and penetration of new markets 
performance materials net sales represented of the company s net sales in throughout  the filtration and industrial thermal insulation businesses were negatively impacted by global economic conditions resulting in less demand for lydall s products compared to as a result of these conditions  net sales and operating income in for the performance materials segment were million and million  respectively  compared to net sales and operating income of million and million  respectively  in 
table of contents the performance materials businesses experienced marginal improvement in the second half of  compared to the first half of  as net sales improved by approximately 
however  net sales in the last half of still remain below levels prior to the global economic recession 
while there has been marginal improvement in certain markets in the last half of  global economic uncertainties continue to affect the markets in which its businesses operate and make the company s financial results difficult to predict going into in  the segment will continue to focus on commercializing solupor membrane technology gained in the solutech acquisition 
the primary focus will be on arioso tm high performance air filtration composite media 
this product line constitutes the media component of advanced clean air systems for applications in clean space  commercial  industrial and residential hvac  power generation  industrial processes  and protection respiratory devices 
thermal acoustical segment the thermal acoustical segment provides solutions to assist in noise and heat abatement in various types of automobiles 
lydall products shield several areas in automobiles from heat thermal and sound acoustical sources including the underbody  under hood and interior areas 
segment net sales were million  or  of the company s net sales  compared to million  or of lydall s net sales 
in  the segment was impacted by significantly less demand for automobiles by consumers in the us and europe due to the global economic recession and restrictions on available credit for consumer automobile loans 
as a result of lower production levels of automobiles  net sales from the thermal acoustical segment were lower by million  or  in compared to according to a published automotive market forecasting service  production in north america and europe of cars and light trucks in was lower by approximately  or million vehicles  as compared to in comparison to  production of cars and light trucks in was lower by approximately  or million vehicles 
operating loss for the segment in was million compared with an operating loss of million in operating loss in was impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of million and million of restructuring related charges associated with the north american automotive facilities consolidation na auto consolidation into its hamptonville  nc operation 
in addition to the million reduction in net sales in compared to  the segment results were impacted by restructuring related charges of million to complete the na auto consolidation 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company started to benefit from reduced operating costs as a result of the na auto consolidation 
however  in the fourth quarter of as the volume of orders from customers increased  the company incurred incremental ramp up costs associated with the business transferred from the company s vermont facility 
higher labor costs and other operating costs associated with the performance of certain equipment and tools transferred from vermont resulted in savings from the consolidation being partially offset by these higher manufacturing costs 
the company expects higher manufacturing costs to persist into the first quarter of  but on an annualized basis  the company expects to save approximately million to million in costs as a result of this consolidation 
while overall production of automobiles in the us and europe was significantly lower in compared to levels in and  production of cars and light trucks was higher in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of by approximately 
this increased production in the fourth quarter contributed to an increase of net sales of automotive parts of million  or  compared to the third quarter of while there has been marginal improvement in automobile production in the fourth quarter of  volatile market conditions including dramatic fluctuations in consumer demand for automobiles continue to persist in the automotive market 
as a result  global economic uncertainties make the company s financial results difficult to predict going into in  the segment will also continue the long term focus on expanding the company s position with asian automotive manufacturers in north america 
the company has been qualified as a supplier to multiple asian manufacturers  quoted on automotive platforms  received orders and started to ship parts 
other areas of focus for will include the continued development of thermal acoustical products for non automotive applications  including aerospace  appliances and military applications 
other products and services the components of other products and services ops are lydall s vital fluids business and affinity temperature control equipment business affinity and collectively  ops net sales represented of the company s net sales 

table of contents the vital fluids business  which serves the life science industry  reported net sales of million and operating income of million in  compared to million of net sales and million of operating income in the company is taking steps to increase its market share in the bioprocessing market 
in support of this  the company is investing approximately million  including million which was invested in  to increase clean room space capacity and acquire new biodisposable bag manufacturing equipment 
market conditions in the semiconductor industry continued to negatively impact capital equipment spending by that industry 
as a result  lydall s affinity business  which primarily serves the semiconductor industry  reported net sales of million and an operating loss of million in  compared to net sales of million and an operating loss of million in affinity s operating loss included goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges of million 

table of contents consolidated results of operations net sales in thousands of dollars percent change percent change net sales the decrease in net sales of million  compared with  was primarily the result of lower net sales from the company s thermal acoustical segment of million  or 
the thermal acoustical segment is comprised of the company s automotive businesses 
lower automotive parts net sales of million were partially offset by improved automotive tooling net sales of million 
performance materials segment net sales in decreased by million  or  compared to  as filtration and industrial thermal insulation product net sales decreased by million and million  respectively 
net sales of ops in decreased by million  or  compared to  as net sales from the vital fluids business decreased by million and net sales from the affinity business decreased by million 
foreign currency translation decreased net sales by million for the current year  compared with  impacting the thermal acoustical segment by million and the performance materials segment by million 
the decrease in net sales in of million  compared with  was primarily the result of lower net sales from the thermal acoustical segment of million  including lower automotive parts net sales of million  partially offset by improved automotive tooling net sales of million 
also contributing to lower net sales in was decreased net sales from ops of million 
the vital fluids business reported increased net sales of million in  which was offset by lower net sales from the company s affinity business of million 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher performance materials segment net sales of million in compared to contributing to this increase was higher filtration media net sales of million and industrial thermal insulation products of million 
foreign currency translation increased net sales by million in  compared with  impacting the thermal acoustical segment by million and the performance materials segment by million 
gross margin in thousands of dollars gross margin percentage of sales the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily caused by lower gross margin percentage from the thermal acoustical segment  and to a lesser extent  from the performance materials segment and from ops  which were all significantly impacted by global economic conditions 
a reduction in net sales of million  including a decrease in thermal acoustical segment net sales of million  resulted in higher per unit manufacturing costs  as each unit absorbed a greater amount of fixed costs 
also  higher raw material costs in  compared to  contributed to lower gross margin percentage for the thermal acoustical segment 
restructuring related charges of million in  associated with the na auto consolidation  negatively impacted gross margin percentage by approximately basis points 
partially offsetting the above factors reducing gross margin percentage was savings realized from the company s lean six sigma program 
the decrease in gross margin percentage by basis points in as compared to was caused by lower gross margin percentage from the thermal acoustical segment 
contributing to this reduction was lower net sales of million  which resulted in higher per unit manufacturing costs due to each unit absorbing a greater amount of fixed costs  as well as increased raw material costs in as compared to also  restructuring related charges of million in  associated with the na auto consolidation  negatively impacted gross margin percentage by approximately basis points 
gross margin percentage in for the performance materials segment was essentially flat with ops gross margin percentage in was essentially flat with  as improvements in vital fluids gross margin percentage were offset by reduced gross margin percentage from the affinity business 

table of contents selling  product development and administrative expenses in thousands of dollars selling  product development and administrative expenses percentage of sales selling  product development and administrative expenses decreased in by million  or million when excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  compared to the inclusion of expenses from the solutech business  included in the performance materials segment and acquired in december  resulted in an additional million of selling  product development and administrative expenses in including the results of the solutech business  the overall reduction in selling  product development and administrative expenses in was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages expense of million  incentive compensation expense of million  sales commission expenses of million  travel expenses of million and bad debt expense of million  as well as reductions in other discretionary spending 
partially offsetting these decreases was higher expense of million related to the amortization of intangible assets of the solutech business 
lower salaries and wages expense was due to reductions in workforce from the na auto consolidation completed in the first half of  other workforce reduction initiatives  and the december realignment of management within the company s north american and european automotive operations  resulting in lower salaries and wages expense in lower incentive compensation expense was due to not meeting targets for the company s bonus plan 
lower sales commission expenses were due to lower net sales in compared to other actions taken to reduce selling  product development and administrative expenses in compared to included the suspension of its matching contribution to its sponsored k plan in may  for all non union domestic employees 
this reduction in expense was essentially offset by an increase in pension expense of million  compared to  related to the company s sponsored employee benefit plans 
higher pension expense was primarily impacted by a lower expected rate of return on assets in compared to  applied to a lower base of assets  and increases in amortization of actuarial losses 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  selling  product development and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to contributing to this reduction was lower litigation expense of million  recorded primarily in corporate office expenses  and lower incentive compensation expense of million  as well as reductions in sales commission expense of million  employee recruiting and relocation costs of million and consulting expenses of million 
higher salaries and wages expense of million and severance related charges of million in  as compared to  partially offset these decreases 
lower litigation expense was primarily related to a matter with a former employee that significantly impacted the company in lower sales commission expense and incentive compensation expense was due to lower sales and profitability in as compared to higher salaries and wages expense was primarily due to annual wage adjustments 
higher severance related charges were primarily related to realigning management within the company s north american and european automotive operations by eliminating regional business unit presidents and appointing a global automotive president to better maximize synergies between lydall s north american and european automotive operations 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in thousands of dollars goodwill impairment impairment of long lived assets total impairment during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an annual impairment analysis of the million of goodwill in the performance materials reporting unit and million of goodwill in the vital fluids reporting unit  included in ops 
the company concluded that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value of net assets 
as a result  there was no impairment of goodwill in the results of the company s goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of indicated that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to the north american automotive na auto or affinity goodwill 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the million of na auto goodwill and all of the million of affinity goodwill during the fourth quarter of also  the company recorded an impairment of long lived assets charge of million in the fourth quarter of at the affinity business 

table of contents beginning in the second half of  the company s na auto business  included in the thermal acoustical segment  was impacted by negative economic conditions in the united states  dramatically reducing consumer demand for automobiles in the fourth quarter of the company s automotive parts net sales were lower by approximately in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of the company s na auto customers are primarily domestic automakers who reported financial losses  announced facility closures and other restructuring actions 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  north american automakers announced further expected reductions in automobile production in  as compared to typical annual production levels 
certain of these north american automakers also announced concerns about near term cash liquidity  which can negatively impact the company s profitability and cash flows in future periods 
also during the fourth quarter of  the affinity business continued to be significantly impacted by a slow down in capital equipment spending in the semiconductor industry 
net sales were lower by approximately in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of based on information available to lydall in the fourth quarter of  the company anticipated a slower than expected rebound in capital equipment spending  which would continue to negatively impact the company s profitability and cash flows throughout during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its required annual goodwill impairment testing 
negative events and changes in circumstances in the fourth quarter of  as discussed above  including greater risk in the markets that the company s na auto and affinity businesses serve  indicated a reduction in the future discounted cash flows from those businesses 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of there was a sustained decline in the lydall s stock price 
as a result of this decline  the company s market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets during the fourth quarter of the results of the goodwill impairment analysis indicated that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to the na auto or affinity goodwill 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the million of na auto goodwill and all of the million of affinity goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in performing the goodwill assessment  the company used current market capitalization  discounted cash flows and other factors as the best evidence of fair value 
the calculation of future cash flows included management estimates and assumptions that were based on the best available information as of the date of the assessment 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
there are inherent uncertainties and management judgment required in an analysis of goodwill impairment 
as a result of the company s projected undiscounted future cash flows related to certain of its asset groups being less than the carrying value of those asset groups  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of at the affinity business 
the company also performed an assessment of na auto s long lived assets for impairment at december  the undiscounted cash flows over the useful life of its primary asset group exceeded the carrying value of the asset group 
the company determined that impairment of na auto s long lived assets did not exist as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in thousands of dollars interest expense weighted average interest rate during the year the increase in interest expense for compared to was primarily due to increased amortization of debt financing costs associated with the company entering into a domestic credit facility in march  and increases in unused borrowing fees 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower average debt levels in compared to other income and expense in thousands of dollars other income  net the amounts included in other income  net  in all years presented are primarily related to investment income and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses 

table of contents income taxes from continuing operations effective income tax rate the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations for was compared to in and in the company determined it will carry back its taxable loss to prior years 
as a result  at december   an income tax receivable of million was recorded in anticipation of a cash refund expected to be received in this carry back allows foreign tax credits previously utilized by the company to become available for future use 
an analysis was performed of the expected future realization of these foreign tax credits before their expiration  and as a result  the company recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of to record a valuation allowance on the available foreign tax credits for which their future realization is not reasonably assured 
this income tax charge primarily contributed to the effective tax rate differing from the statutory federal income tax rate in as of december   the net amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is million 
during  the company reduced its amount of unrecognized tax benefits by million due primarily to a tax payment 
this payment had no impact on the company s effective tax rate in the company s effective tax rate in was higher than the federal statutory rate on earnings primarily due to changes in statutory tax rates in germany  resulting in incremental income tax charges of million  the impact from the extraterritorial income program eti phase out and implementation of the manufacturer benefit system mbs  and adjustments to the company s unrecognized tax benefits liability 
for  the company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately to 
the company is not aware of any items that would cause a significant difference from the statutory tax rate 
consolidation  restructuring and related charges in september  the company announced that it would be closing its st 
johnsbury  vt manufacturing facility and consolidating its north american automotive parts production into the hamptonville  nc operation 
the company commenced the transfer of equipment and production in the first quarter of and substantially completed the consolidation during the second quarter of in the thermal acoustical segment  the company recorded pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of million over the period of consolidation including pre tax charges of million in and million in  with over recorded in cost of sales during both periods 
these restructuring activity expenses primarily included severance related expenses  acceleration of depreciation expense on fixed assets that were not transferred to the hamptonville  nc facility  and facility exit  moving and set up expenses of equipment transferred from st 
johnsbury  vt to hamptonville  nc 
during the fourth quarter of  the company ceased using the right conveyed by the lease of the st 
johnsbury  vt facility 
as a result  the company estimated the fair value of the remaining lease payments expected to occur through the third quarter of and recorded a lease termination charge of million in the fourth quarter of total cash outflows were million over the period of consolidation  including million in no future restructuring expenses are expected to be incurred related to this consolidation 
other than the remaining lease payments on the st 
johnsbury  vt facility of approximately million  to be made ratably through the third quarter of  there are no other material cash payments expected to be made related to this consolidation 
this consolidation is expected to reduce operating costs significantly  increase efficiency and enhance the company s competitive position while maintaining essentially the same level of manufacturing capacity 
during the second half of  the company began to benefit from reduced operating costs related to this consolidation 
however  in the fourth quarter of as the volume of orders from customers increased  the company incurred greater than expected ramp up costs associated with the business transferred from vermont 
higher labor costs and other operating costs associated with the performance of certain equipment and tools transferred from vermont partially offset savings from the restructuring activities 
the company expects higher than normal manufacturing costs to continue through the first quarter of  but on an annualized basis  the company expects to save approximately million to million in costs as a result of this consolidation 
the company expects approximately of the savings impacting gross margins and the remainder reducing selling  product development and administrative expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates

the fixed charge coverage ratio requires that  at the end of any month  the ratio of consolidated ebitda to fixed charges may not be less than to for the immediately preceding month period  except that prior to august  compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio generally shall be measured during the period commencing as of august  and ending as of the last day of the month in the measuring period 
once the company is required to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio  company borrowings must be less than million and excess availability greater than million for each day for sixty consecutive days in order for the company not to be required to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio until the next time that borrowings under the domestic credit facility exceed million  or excess availability under the credit facility is less than million 
at no time during did the company s borrowings under the domestic credit facility exceed million or was excess availability less than million  therefore  the company was not subject to the minimum cash flow requirement or fixed charge coverage ratio

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments about and estimates of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and acquisition related intangibles 
the company had goodwill of million at december  and million at december  goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  including related goodwill 
the company s reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that operating segment or component 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors such as market capitalization 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge  which did occur during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis of the million of goodwill in the performance materials reporting unit and million of goodwill in the vital fluids reporting unit  included in ops 
the company s goodwill impairment testing analysis analysis included projecting cash flows for the years and discounting those amounts based on appropriate market risks 
based on those projections and other assumption used in the analysis  the company concluded that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value of net assets 
as a result  there was no impairment of goodwill 
a one basis point increase in the discount rate used in the analysis would not change the company s conclusion for the vital fluids and performance materials reporting units 
along with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate  the analysis indicated that a reduction in the projected operating income of the vital fluids and the performance materials reporting units over the next five years of approximately and  respectively  would require the company to perform an additional step to measure the amount of an impairment loss  if any 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s na auto business  included in the thermal acoustical segment  was severely impacted by significant declines in sales of automobiles as a result of a global economic downturn and increased consumer credit restrictions 
the company s na auto customers are primarily domestic automakers who were reporting financial losses  closing facilities due to reduced manufacturing levels and capacity requirements and announcing other restructuring actions 
during the fourth quarter of  three of the largest north american automakers announced further expected reductions in automobile production in  as compared to typical annual production levels 
also  the affinity business  included in ops  continued to be impacted by lower net sales and operating losses due to a slow down in capital equipment spending in the semiconductor industry 
these factors  as well as greater risk in the automotive and semiconductor markets that the company serves  resulted in the fair value of the na auto and affinity reporting units to be lower than their book value 
the results of the goodwill impairment analysis indicated that there was no remaining implied fair value attributable to na auto or affinity goodwill 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the million of na auto goodwill and all of the million of affinity goodwill during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
the carrying values of the assets determined to be impaired are reduced to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the impaired assets are determined based on market conditions  including independent appraisals when appropriate  the income approach which utilizes cash flow projections  and other factors 
the company determined that long lived assets at the affinity business were impaired at december  this was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows and independent appraisals for its asset group  which indicated that the fair value was less than their carrying value 
the company considered its asset group to be certain assets and liabilities at affinity  primarily consisting of machinery and equipment  and buildings and improvements 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of  which represented the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset group compared to the carrying value of the asset group see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pensions pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuary based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
pension plans outside the us are not significant at december  a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of will be utilized for determining pension cost  which is consistent with what was used for calculating pension 
table of contents costs 
in determining pension cost for and  the company used an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of marketable debt and equity securities and economic and other indicators of future performance 
investment management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to balance market risk and to provide sufficient liquidity for near term payments of benefits accrued under the plan and to pay the expenses of administration 
the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december  and  the company based its discount rate assumption on a cash flow matching analysis  which matches the future cash outflows of the pension plans to a yield curve comprised of high quality fixed income investments 
benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve and a single discount rate specific to the plans is determined 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
pension accounting guidance requires that gains or losses be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in the pension accounting guidance 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for these plans is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently  pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension expense related to its defined benefit plans in the us of million as a result of the expected return on assets being lower than the aggregate of i service cost from eligible employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement  ii interest cost  iii amortization of actuarial loss and prior service cost and iv the net impact of pension expense related to curtailments and a settlement aggregating to million in as discussed above  the company s discount rate was at december  and was used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension cost for is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the company contributed million to its us defined benefit pension plans during and expects to contribute approximately million in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets 
table of contents can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return  as well as returns required by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  france  germany and the netherlands 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal examinations for years before  state and local examinations for years before  and non us income tax examinations for years before in assessing the need for reserves for uncertainties in income taxes recognized  a significant number of estimates and judgments must be made by the company 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is million as of december  unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on the distribution to the united states because it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
if remitted  the additional united states tax liability is not expected to be material 
the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be adversely affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  changes in tax rates or tax laws and the completion of tax audits 
equity compensation plans the company accounts for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognizes such amounts in the statements of operations 
the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  and such estimates of forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
the effect of changes in estimated forfeitures is recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company estimates the fair value of option grants based on the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility and expected term are based on historical information 
the company believes that future volatility and expected term are not likely to materially differ from the company s historical stock price volatility and historical exercise data  respectively
