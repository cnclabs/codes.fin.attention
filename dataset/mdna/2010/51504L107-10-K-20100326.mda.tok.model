landmark national bank also originates small business  multi family residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans 
although not our primary business function  we do invest in certain investment and mortgage related securities using deposits and other borrowings as funding sources 
our results of operations depend generally on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
while net interest income increased during as compared to  our results were affected by certain non interest related items  including an increase in the provision for loan losses as compared to net interest income is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest earning assets mature or reprice at different times  or at different speeds  than our interest bearing liabilities 
our results of operations are also affected by non interest income  such as service charges  loan fees and gains from the sale of newly originated loans and gains or losses on investments 
our principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy costs  federal deposit insurance costs  data processing expenses and provision for loan losses 
we are significantly impacted by prevailing economic conditions including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulations of financial institutions

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those  which are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of investment securities  accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which involve significant judgment by our management 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of our lending portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
while these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining allowance requirements  nevertheless  actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results 
additional explanation of the methodologies used in establishing this reserve are provided in the asset quality and distribution section 
the company has classified its investment securities portfolio as available for sale  with the exception of certain investments held for regulatory purposes 
the company carries its available for sale investment securities at fair value and employs valuation techniques which utilize observable inputs when those inputs are available 
these observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the security  developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
when such information is not available  the company employs valuation techniques which utilize unobservable inputs  or those which reflect the company s own assumptions about market participants  based on the best information available in the circumstances 
these valuation methods typically involve estimated cash flows and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  estimates  or other inputs to the valuation techniques could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements are classified as level quoted prices  level based on observable inputs or level based on unobservable inputs 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
purchased premiums and discounts on investment securities are amortized accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the securities using the interest method 
gains and losses on sales of available for sale securities are recorded on a trade date basis and are calculated using the specific identification method 
the company performs quarterly reviews of the investment portfolio to determine if any investment securities have any declines in fair value which might be considered other than temporary 
the initial review begins with all securities in an unrealized loss position 
the company s assessment of other than temporary impairment is based on its reasonable judgment of the specific facts and circumstances impacting each individual security at the time such assessments are made 
the company reviews and considers factual information  including expected cash flows  the structure of the security  the credit quality of the underlying assets and the current and anticipated market conditions 
as of january   the company early adopted the guidance on other than temporary impairments in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc investments debt and equity securities  which changed the accounting for other than temporary impairments of debt securities and separates the impairment into credit related and other factors for debt securities 
any credit related impairments are realized through a charge to earnings 
if an equity security is determined to be other than temporarily impaired  the entire impairment is realized through a charge to earnings 
we have completed several business and asset acquisitions  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by our management 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined and based on purchase price allocations 
the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets 
performing such a discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including the historical cash flows 
due to the number of estimates involved related to the allocation of purchase price and determining the appropriate useful lives of intangible assets  we have identified purchase accounting  and the subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets  as a critical accounting policy 
goodwill is not amortized  however  it is tested for impairment at each calendar year end or more frequently when events or circumstances dictate 
the impairment test compares the carrying value of goodwill to an implied fair value of the goodwill  which is based on a review of the company s market capitalization adjusted for appropriate control premiums as well as an analysis of valuation multiples of recent  comparable acquisitions 
the company considers the result from each these valuation methods in determining the implied fair value of its goodwill 
a goodwill impairment would be recorded for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
during the first quarter of  the decline in the company s market capitalization coupled with the market conditions in the financial services industry  constituted a triggering event which required an impairment test to be performed 
the company performed impairment tests as of march  and december  by comparing the implied fair value of the company s single reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value was determined using observable market data  including the company s market capitalization  with control premiums and valuation multiples  compared to recent financial industry acquisition multiples for similar institutions to estimate the fair value of the company s single reporting unit 
the company s impairment tests as of march  and december  indicate that goodwill as of these dates was not impaired 
the company can make no assurances that future impairment tests will not result in goodwill impairments 
intangible assets include core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights 
core deposit intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of ten years on an accelerated basis 
when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment  the company will evaluate the recoverability of the intangible asset carrying value  using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining asset life 
any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value 
mortgage servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the sale of financial assets  primarily one to four family real estate loans and are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized into non interest expense in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value  and are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the retained rights as compared to amortized cost 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns 
on january  the company adopted the revised accounting guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  in which an income tax position will be recognized only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon irs examination  based upon its technical merits 
once that status is met  the amount recorded will be the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the company assesses it deferred tax assets to determine if the items are more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is established for any amounts that are not more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates regarding the actual outcome of these future tax consequences  including the effects of irs examinations and examinations by other state agencies  could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for decreased million  or  to million as compared to net earnings of million in the decline in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in our provision for loan losses  impairment charges to our investment security portfolio and increases in fdic premiums 
we increased our provision for loan losses by  in  as compared to  due to the impact of declining residential and commercial real estate values impacting the underlying collateral in our loan portfolio  increased levels of non accrual and past due loans and the impact of the current economic environment on our loan customers 
also during  we identified our portfolio of pooled trust preferred securities as other than temporarily impaired  which resulted in net credit related impairment charges of  our non interest expenses increased by million  to million  during as compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in fdic insurance premiums 
our fdic insurance premiums increased by  as the result of a  special assessment  higher assessment rates and the depletion of our previously unused fdic credits 
we also experienced increases in expenses relating to the acquisition and operation of a second branch in lawrence  kansas and higher foreclosure and other real estate costs 
offsetting the increased expenses was a million increase in non interest income  which was primarily attributable to a million increase in gains on sale of loans driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market 
results for included a  gain from the prepayment of a fhlb advance  which represented the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting and  of gains on sales of investment securities 
our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased from for to for during we were able to reduce our cost of deposits and borrowings enough to offset the lower yields earned on loans and investment securities as our interest earning assets and liabilities repriced in markets that experienced a dramatic decline in benchmark interest rates that began in late and continued throughout and the lower cost of funding allowed us to increase our net interest margin in a market that as of december  still exhibited interest rates that were very low compared to historical levels

we distributed a stock dividend for the ninth consecutive year in december all per share and average share data in this section reflects the and stock dividends 
interest income 
interest income for decreased million  or  to million from million for the decline in interest income was a result of lower yields on interest earning assets as loans and investments mature and typically reprice lower in this low interest rate environment  an increase in non accrual loans and a decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for  due to a decrease in the average yield on loans from during to during and lower average balances  which decreased to million in from million in average investment securities increased from million for  to million for the average yield on our investment securities decreased to during from during interest income on investment securities decreased  or  to million for as the lower yields more than offset the higher average balances 
the increased levels of investments were the result of the increased liquidity primarily from lower outstanding loan balances 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased million  or  to million from million for interest expense on deposits decreased million to million  or  from million in primarily as a result of lower rates on our maturing certificates of deposit and lower rates on money market and now accounts due to the decline in interest rates 
our total cost of deposits declined from during to during while our average interest bearing deposit balances increased from million in to million in  the mix of average deposit balances shifted from higher cost certificate of deposit balances to lower cost money market  now and savings accounts contributing to lower cost of deposits 
during interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  due to lower outstanding borrowings 
our average outstanding borrowings declined from million during to million during  while our cost of borrowing was in both years 
net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income derived from interest earning assets and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earnings assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread as well as the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for increased  to million  from million in on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased  and net interest margin increased to from for and  respectively 
the increase in net interest margin occurred primarily because we were able to reduce our costs of funding by more than our yields declined on our interest earning assets as our interest earning assets and liabilities continue to reprice lower in this low interest rate environment 
the average cost of our liabilities declined while our average yield on assets only declined during as compared to the improvement in net interest margin from interest rates more than offset the lower average balances of interest earning assets which declined from million in to million in provision for loan losses 
we maintain  and our board of directors monitors  an allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance is established based upon management s periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  review of significant individual loans and collateral  review of delinquent loans  past loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  current and expected market conditions  and other factors management deems important 
determining the appropriate level of reserves involves a high degree of management judgment and is based upon historical and projected losses in the loan portfolio and the collateral value of specifically identified problem loans 
additionally  allowance strategies and policies are subject to periodic review and revision in response to a number of factors  including current market conditions  actual loss experience and management s expectations 
the provision for loan losses for was million  compared to a provision of million during our provision for loan losses increased  in based on the analysis of our loan portfolio  which indicated the additional provision for loan losses was warranted given the impact of declining residential and commercial real estate values impacting the underlying collateral in our loan portfolio  increased levels of non accrual and past due loans and the impact of the current economic environment on our loan customers 
our provision for loan losses was higher in both and than compared to historical levels prior to  due to the difficult conditions that continue to exist in the economy and the impact on our loan portfolio as well as increased levels of charge offs and nonperforming loans experienced in the recent difficult economic and credit environments 
we have been working diligently to identify and address the credit weaknesses in our loan portfolio 
while it is difficult to forecast future events  we believe that our current allowance for loan losses  coupled with our capital levels  loan portfolio management and underlying fundamental earnings before the provision for loan losses  positions us to deal with this challenging environment 
for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  refer to the asset quality and distribution section 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  for  to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million  or  in gains on sale of loans 
the increased gains on sales of loans were driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans as a result of low mortgage rates and tax incentives to homebuyers that were available in  as well as our expansion of the mortgage lending activities over the past few years 
these residential real estate loans were primarily sold in the secondary market 
partially offsetting the increased gains on sales of loans  was a  gain that was recognized during from the prepayment of a fhlb advance  which represented the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment required by purchase accounting 
investment securities gains losses 
during  each of our three investments in pooled trust preferred securities  with original par values totaling million  were identified as other than temporarily impaired as a result of increased levels of deferrals and defaults on the debt obligations of the financial companies underlying securities  which exceeded our previous expectations 
the increased levels of non performing assets in the collateral pools resulted in the recognition of  of estimated credit losses associated with these investments during  while the non credit related losses of million were recognized in other comprehensive income 
in  we recorded  of gains on sales of investment securities as compared to  during non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during  as compared to this increase was primarily driven by increases of  in fdic insurance premiums   or  in compensation and benefits   or  in professional fees and  or  in foreclosure and other real estate expenses 
the increase in fdic insurance premiums was the result of a  special assessment  which affected all fdic insured institutions  as well as higher assessment rates which have been imposed on all deposit institutions  and the depletion of our previously unused fdic assessment credits 
the increase in compensation and benefits was driven by higher salary costs and the addition of employees resulting from the acquisition of a branch in lawrence  kansas 
the increases in professional fees are primarily associated with our branch acquisition  but were also elevated due to costs associated with outsourcing part of our it management and future compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in foreclosure and other real estate expenses  which is included in other non interest expense  was the result of increased foreclosure activity and other real estate balances as we address our nonperforming loans 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased  to  for  from million for our effective tax rate declined from during to for the decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for resulted primarily from a decrease in taxable income  as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  while our tax exempt investment income and bank owned life insurance remained similar between and comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for decreased  or  to million as compared to the decrease in earnings was primarily due to a million increase in our provision for loan losses 
during our loan loss analysis indicated it was necessary to increase our provision for loan losses based upon our analysis of our loan portfolio as well as deteriorating market conditions 
even though our levels of non accrual and past due loans declined during  increased levels of loan loss provision were warranted given the economic environment  the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the recession and the loan losses and resulting charge offs experienced during partially offsetting the higher provision for loan losses were gains of  on sales of investment securities and  of gains on the prepayment of two fhlb advances  as well as an increase of  in gains on sales of loans 
market conditions during the second quarter of allowed us to sell longer term  higher yielding us agency obligations while purchasing shorter term  lower yielding mortgage backed obligations at gains that were higher than the reductions in interest income as a result of the transactions 
during  we began a strategy of issuing longer term  fixed rate fhlb advances and repaying shorter term fhlb advances to lengthen our fhlb advance maturities while rates were believed to be at a relatively low point in the rate cycle 
as a result of the prepayment of two million advances  we recognized gains of  which represented the unamortized fair value adjustment required by purchase accounting for a prior acquisition 
the increase in gains on sales of loans was driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market

net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earnings assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread as well as the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased  to million compared to the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase in net interest income was due primarily to the decline in our cost of funding outpacing the decline in our yield on interest earning assets  which resulted in our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increasing to from for and  respectively 
during we were able to reduce our cost of deposits and borrowings enough to offset the lower yield on loans in a market that experienced a dramatic decline in benchmark interest rates that began in late and continued throughout the lower cost of funding allowed us to maintain our net interest margin in markets that had considerable competitive pricing pressures 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for  compared to  for we increased our provision for loan losses based on our analysis of the loan portfolio as well as deteriorating market conditions 
even though our levels of non accrual and past due loans declined from december  to december   increased levels of loan loss provision were warranted given the economic environment and the uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the recession we are currently experiencing 
the company s non accrual loans declined to million at december  from million as of december  the decline was primarily the result of the collection of the outstanding balances of two loan relationships totaling million during and increased charge offs of balances in non accrual at december  net loan charge offs for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the year ended december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of gross loans outstanding  compared to million  or of gross loans outstanding  at december  non interest income 
total non interest income increased million to million for  which was primarily attributable to  in gains on sales of investment securities  a  gain on the prepayment of fhlb advances and increases of  in gains on sales of loans and  in fees and service charges  as compared to the increase in gains on sales of loans were driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market while the increase in fees and service charges were primarily deposit related 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased  an increase of during as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to increases of  in compensation and benefits and  in other non interest expense 
the increase in compensation and benefits was driven primarily by increased staffing levels and general pay increases 
the increased staffing levels were primarily related to increased one to four family residential mortgage loan staff 
the increase in other non interest expenses was primarily the result of  increase in foreclosure and other real estate asset expenses  as well as  of other than temporary impairment charges on certain investment securities 
during our fdic deposit insurance costs were primarily offset by assessment credits that were previously received

while the markets in which the company operates have been impacted by the economic slowdown  the effect has not been as severe as those experienced in some areas of the us outside of the identified problem assets  management believes that it continues to have a high quality asset base and solid earnings and anticipates that its efforts to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue to create a strong foundation for continued growth and profitability in the future 
asset quality and distribution 
total assets decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates and economic conditions 
net loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased to million as of december  from million at december  the million decline in net loans is primarily the result of a million decline in our one to four family residential loan portfolio as a result of refinancings and paydowns in our existing portfolio as we typically sell most of our newly originated one to four family loans 
also contributing to the decline in net loans was a million decline in construction and land loans as we continued to reduce our exposure to those types of loans and a million decline in commercial loans 
we have concentrated on generating commercial and commercial real estate loans over the past few years 
this is consistent with our strategy to continue to reduce portfolio reliance on construction loans and residential mortgage loans  most of which have been acquired in previous acquisitions  while increasing our loan portfolio in the area of commercial lending 
even though we continue to concentrate on generating commercial and commercial real estate loans  these loans declined in in part due to a decline during in demand for commercial and commercial real estate loans that met our credit and asset quality standards 
as of december   our commercial loans  including commercial real estate loans  comprised of our loan portfolio  up from at december  as of december   our construction and land loans comprised of total gross loans  down from at december  as we continue to reduce our exposure to these loans 
as of december   our one to four family residential loans comprised of total gross loans  down from at december  as one to four family residential loans in our portfolio continue to refinance and pay down 
we anticipate continuing to diversify our loan portfolio composition through our continued planned expansion of commercial and commercial real estate lending activities and continued refinancings and paydowns in our portfolio of one to four family residential loans 
our primary investing activities are the origination of commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans and the purchase of investment and mortgage backed securities 
generally  we originate fixed rate  residential mortgage loans with maturities in excess of ten years for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are typically sold soon after the loan closing 
we do not originate and warehouse these fixed rate residential loans for resale in order to speculate on interest rates 
as of december   our residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of million with fixed rates and million with variable rates 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activity 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans with respect to which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  level of classified loans and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for losses on loans 
during  we have experienced an increase in our non performing assets due to the difficult conditions that continue to exist in the economy and its impact on our loan portfolio 
as a result of the impact of declining residential and commercial real estate values on the underlying collateral in our loan portfolio  increased levels of non accrual and past due loans and the current economic environment on our loan customers  we have increased our provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december  our provision for loan losses totaled million as compared to million during the same period of as a result  our allowance for loan losses has increased to million at december  from million at december  we feel that higher levels of provisions for loan losses are appropriate based upon our analysis of our loan portfolio as well as the effects of the depressed market conditions on our loan portfolio 
we feel the external risks within the environment which we operate remain present today and will need to be continuously monitored 
we have identified the stresses in our loan portfolio and are working to reduce the risks of certain loan exposures  including significantly reducing our exposure to construction loans 
although we believe that we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
loans past due more than a month totaled million at december   compared to million at december  at december   million in loans were on non accrual status  or of net loans  compared to a balance of million  or of net loans  at december  non accrual loans consist primarily of loans greater than ninety days past due and which are also included in the past due loan balances 
there were no loans days delinquent and still accruing interest at december  or december  the increase in non accrual and past due loans was primarily driven by a million construction loan relationship and a million commercial agriculture loan that were classified as non accrual and past due during our impaired loans increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily because of the same two loans that increased the non accrual and past due loan balances 
our analysis of the two nonperforming loans mentioned above concluded that the potential exists that the updated collateral values or sources of repayment may not be sufficient to fully cover the outstanding loan balances 
as part of the company s credit risk management  we continue to aggressively manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and have placed additional emphasis on commercial real estate and construction relationships 
during we had net loan charge offs of million compared to million of net loan charge offs for the comparable period of the net loan charge offs during were primarily related to the charge off of a million commercial loan relationship that was liquidated during the net loan charge offs were primarily related to the liquidation of a pool of non owner occupied  one to four family residential loans  made to a single entity in the kansas city  missouri area 
these loans were secured by houses located in deteriorating neighborhoods and were originally obtained as part of a previous acquisition 
although the recent economic recession created a very difficult environment for financial institutions  as well as other businesses  the us government  federal reserve and the treasury department initiated many programs to try to stimulate the economy 
nevertheless  many financial institutions  including us  have experienced an increase in non performing assets during the recent economic period  as even well established business borrowers developed cash flow  profitability and other business related problems 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses at december   was adequate  however  there can be no assurances that losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
while we believe that we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
further deterioration in the local economy or real estate values may create additional problem loans for us and require further adjustment to our allowance for loan losses 
liability distribution 
total deposits decreased to million at december  from million at december  during we were able to increase our retail deposits by million  which includes million of assumed deposits from our branch acquisition  while reducing our public fund deposits by million 
the decline in public fund deposits was primarily concentrated in short term certificates of deposits which are typically acquired through a bid process and are awarded to the bank that bids the highest rate 
borrowings decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decline in borrowings was primarily related to the maturity of million of fhlb advances during and paying off the balance on our fhlb line of credit 
non interest bearing deposits at december  were million  or of deposits  compared to million  or  at december  money market and now deposit accounts were of our deposit portfolio and totaled million at december   compared to million  or  at december  savings accounts increased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or  at december  certificates of deposit decreased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or  at december  certificates of deposit at december   which were scheduled to mature in one year or less  totaled million 
historically  maturing deposits have generally remained with the bank and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain with us upon maturity 
cash flows 
during the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
our operating activities during provided net cash of million  while our net investing activities generated million in the net cash inflow from investing activities was primarily related to the net decrease in loans 
our financing activities used net cash of million during  primarily to reduce borrowings 
liquidity 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the level of these assets is dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december  and  the carrying value of these liquid assets totaled million and million  respectively 
during periods in which we are not able to originate a sufficient amount of loans and or periods of high principal prepayments  we increase our liquid assets by investing in short term  high grade investments 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of our strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in short term investments 
in the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are generally available through the use of fhlb advances  a line of credit with the fhlb  other borrowings or through sales of securities 
at december   we had outstanding fhlb advances of million and no borrowings against our line of credit with the fhlb 
at december   our total borrowing capacity with the fhlb was million 
at december   we had no borrowings through the federal reserve discount window  while our borrowing capacity was million 
we also have various other fed funds agreements  both secured and unsecured  with correspondent banks totaling approximately million at december   which had no borrowings against at that time 
we had other borrowings of million at december   which included million of subordinated debentures and million in repurchase agreements 
the company has a million line of credit from an unrelated financial institution maturing on november   with an interest rate that adjusts daily based on the prime rate plus  but not less than 
this line of credit has covenants specific to capital and other financial ratios  which the company was in compliance with at december  the outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  was million  which was included in other borrowings 
as a provider of financial services  we routinely issue financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
while these standby letters of credit represent a potential outlay by us  a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
we have recourse against the customer for any amount the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
the letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies  underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us 
most of the standby letters of credit are secured  and in the event of nonperformance by the customers  we have the right to the underlying collateral  which could include commercial real estate  physical plant and property  inventory  receivables  cash and marketable securities 
the contract amount of these standby letters of credit  which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us  was million at december  at december   we had outstanding loan commitments  excluding standby letters of credit  of million 
we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet current loan commitments 
these commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance real estate loans 
capital 
the federal reserve has established capital requirements for bank holding companies which generally parallel the capital requirements for national banks under occ regulations 
the regulations provide that such standards will generally be applied on a consolidated rather than a bank only basis in the case of a bank holding company with more than million in total consolidated assets 
at december   we continued to maintain a sound leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  our capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent amount percent leverage tier capital total risk based capital at december   landmark national bank continued to maintain a sound leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  landmark national bank s capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent amount percent leverage tier capital total risk based capital banks and bank holding companies are generally expected to operate at or above the minimum capital requirements 
the above ratios are well in excess of regulatory minimums and should allow us to operate without capital adequacy concerns 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of establishes a bank rating system based on the capital levels of banks 
as of december  and  we were rated well capitalized  which is the highest rating available under this capital based rating system 
we have million in trust preferred securities which  in accordance with current capital guidelines  has been included in tier capital as of december  cash distributions on the securities are payable quarterly  are deductible for income tax purposes and are included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
on march   the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a final rule regarding the continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter standards 
as a result of the final rule  the federal reserve will limit the aggregate amount of a bank holding company s cumulative perpetual preferred stock  trust preferred securities and other minority interests to of a company s core capital elements  net of goodwill 
regulations in place at the time we placed our currently outstanding trust preferred securities did not require the deduction of goodwill 
the rule also provides that amounts of qualifying trust preferred securities and certain minority interests in excess of the limit may be included in tier capital but will be limited  together with subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock  to of tier capital 
the final rule provides a five year transition period for bank holding companies to meet these quantitative limitations 
dividends during the year ended december   we paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share to our stockholders 
additionally  we distributed a stock dividend for the ninth consecutive year in december the cash dividends have been adjusted to give effect to the stock dividend 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations 
as described above  landmark national bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of december  the national bank act imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that a national bank may pay without prior regulatory approval 
generally  the amount is limited to the bank s current year s net earnings plus the adjusted retained earnings for the two preceding years 
as of december   approximately million was available to be paid as dividends to landmark bancorp by landmark national bank without prior regulatory approval 
additionally  our ability to pay dividends is limited by the subordinated debentures that are held by two business trusts that we control 
interest payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock  including our common stock 
we have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to consecutive quarters 
however  if we elect to defer interest payments  all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock 
recent accounting developments in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance  accounting standards codification asc  on the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which amends guidance for recognizing and reporting other than temporary impairments of debt securities and improves the presentation of other than temporary impairments in financial statements for both debt and equity securities 
companies are now required to separate an other than temporary impairment of a debt security into credit related losses and other factors when management asserts that it does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
the amount of other than temporary impairment related to credit losses is recognized in earnings while the amount related to other factors is recorded in other comprehensive income 
the company adopted the accounting guidance effective january  and applied the principles to its other than temporary impairment analysis during  including investments in pooled trust preferred securities which resulted in the recognition of credit related impairments of  in earnings while the noncredit related impairments of million are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance  asc a  for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability  in relation to normal market activity  has significantly decreased 
the guidance emphasizes that the objective of fair value measurement remains the same  determining the price that would be received or paid in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the company adopted this guidance as of january  and has applied the guidance to its pooled trust preferred securities 
in april  the fasb amended existing guidance  asc  on the disclosure about fair value of financial instruments to include interim reporting periods  in addition to annual disclosures 
the company adopted the guidance on april  and began including the disclosures in its interim reports beginning with the june  reporting period 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance asc subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
in particular this statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize subsequent events or transactions and the disclosures required 
the company adopted this guidance for the year ended december  and concluded there were no material subsequent events the date that these financial statements were issued 
in june  the fasb amended the existing guidance to asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the revision pertains to accounting for transfers of loans  participating interests in loans and other financial assets and reinforced the determination of whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred financial assets 
that determination must consider the transferor s continuing involvements in the transferred financial asset  including all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  the transfer  even if they were not entered into at the time of the transfer 
it added the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
a qualifying participating interest requires each of the following conveys proportionate ownership rights with equal priority to each participating interest holder  involves no recourse other than standard representations and warranties to  or subordination by  any participating interest holder  and does not entitle any participating interest holder to receive cash before any other participating interest holder 
if the transfer does not meet those conditions  a transferor should account for the transfer as a sale only if it transfers the entire financial asset or a group of entire financial assets and surrenders control over the entire transferred assets in accordance with the conditions in asc  as amended 
the company adopted the guidance as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb improved the financial reporting of variable interest entities and provided clarification as a result of the elimination of qualifying special purpose entities 
for calendar year companies  this statement is effective for annual periods ending on december  and for all interim and annual periods thereafter 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb established the accounting standards codification asc as the source of authoritative us gaap 
rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
going forward the board will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standards updates asu 
the board will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right 
asu will serve only to update the codification  provide background information about the guidance  and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the codification 
the company applied this guidance beginning with the interim reporting period of september  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb updated the codification on accounting for distributions to shareholders that offers them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all shareholders can receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in eps prospectively and is not a stock dividend 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods after december   and would be applied on a retrospective basis 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosure about fair value measurements which requires new disclosures related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the asu requires new disclosures about the transfers into and out of levels and as well as requiring disclosures about level activity relating to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the update also clarifies that fair value measurement disclosures should be at an appropriate level of disaggregation and that an appropriate class of assets and liabilities is often a subset of the line items in the financial statements 
the update also clarifies that disclosures should include the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value in levels and for both recurring and nonrecurring measurements 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for disclosures on the level activity relating to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements which are effective for interim and annual periods after december  in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
the amendments in the asu remove the requirement for companies that are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements 
revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of us generally accepted accounting principals us gaap 
the fasb also clarified that if the financial statements have been revised  then an entity that is not an sec filer should disclose both the date that the financial statements were issued or available to be issued and the date the revised financial statements were issued or available to be issued 
the fasb believes these amendments remove potential conflicts with the sec s literature 
all of the amendments in the asu were effective upon issuance  except for the use of the issued date for conduit debt obligors  which will be effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation can be found in the increased cost of our operations because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary and interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our assets and liabilities are principally financial in nature and the resulting net interest income thereon is subject to changes in market interest rates and the mix of various assets and liabilities 
interest rates in the financial markets affect our decision on pricing our assets and liabilities which impacts our net interest income  a significant cash flow source for us 
as a result  a substantial portion of our risk management activities relates to managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management committee monitors the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet using earnings simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
we have set policy limits of interest rate risk to be assumed in the normal course of business and monitor such limits through our simulation process 
in the past  we have been successful in meeting the interest rate sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
simulation models are prepared to determine the impact on net interest income for the coming twelve months  including using rates at december  and forecasting volumes for the twelve month projection 
this position is then subjected to a shift in interest rates of and basis points rising and basis points falling with an impact to our net interest income on a one year horizon as follows scenario s change in net interest income change in net interest income basis point rising basis point rising basis point falling asset liability management interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk which measures the relative dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which reprice within a specific time period  either through maturity or rate adjustment 
the gap is the difference between the amounts of such assets and liabilities that are subject to such repricing 
a positive gap for a given period means that the amount of interest earning assets maturing or otherwise repricing within that period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or otherwise repricing during that same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the cost of its liabilities 
conversely  the cost of funds for an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to decline less quickly than the yield on its assets in a falling interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on an institution with a negative gap 
following is our static gap schedule 
one to four family and consumer loans included prepayment assumptions  while all other loans assume no prepayments 
the mortgage backed securities included published prepayment assumptions  while all other investments assume no prepayments 
certificates of deposit reflect contractual maturities only 
money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  a higher percentage of the accounts have been included as repricing immediately in the first period 
savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive as money market accounts and for that reason a significant percentage of the accounts are reflected in the more than to years category 
we have been successful in meeting the interest sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
this has been accomplished primarily by managing the assets and liabilities while maintaining our traditional high credit standards
