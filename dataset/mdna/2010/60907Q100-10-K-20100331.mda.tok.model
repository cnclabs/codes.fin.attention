overview the purpose of this discussion is to provide information about the major components of our results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by monarch bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
monarch bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
we also generate income from non interest sources 
non interest income sources include bank related service charges  fee income from residential and commercial mortgage sales  fee income from the sale of investment and insurance services  income from bank owned life insurance boli policies  as well as gains or losses from the sale of investment securities 
analysis of operating results net income our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the bank and its subsidiaries  after all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests of   and  respectively  are deducted for the years ended december   and  after the income tax provision  to arrive at net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc the ensuing references and ratios are related to net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc  hereon referred to as net income after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest has been deducted 
year ended december  income before taxes income tax provision net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc we reported net income for december  of  compared to  and  for december  and december   respectively 
our basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  at december  basic and diluted earnings per share were for december   and and  respectively  for the year ended december  two important and commonly used measures of profitability are return on assets net income as a percentage of average total assets and return on shareholders equity net income as a percentage of average common shareholders equity 
our returns on average assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the returns on average shareholders equity were  and for the same time periods 
our net income for the year ended december  of  was a new company record 
it represented an increase of compared to and compared to there were three contributing factors to the improvement in net income  net interest income growth  noninterest income growth and  to a lesser degree  controlled noninterest expense relative to income growth 
net interest income increased million in compared to and million compared to the primary source of net interest income growth in was an approximate million decrease in interest expense coupled with a million increase in interest income 
net interest income had been relatively flat  at million and million  respectively in and  with both interest income and interest expense showing little movement 
this notable shift in net interest income is attributable to the lengthening of a lower but stable rate environment which has allowed us  through time  to re price both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities to more profitable levels 
non interest income increased million to million in  compared to million in  which was million higher than our non interest income of million 
high production and market expansion of monarch mortgage  our mortgage division  is the primary source of this growth 
non interest expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in  which was million higher than million in non interest expense in the majority of these increases were in salaries and benefits  loan origination expenses  fdic insurance and occupancy 
provision for loan losses  which had a major impact on our earnings in  increased nominally to million in compared to million in based on historical loan portfolio performance  our provision prior to was less than million 
this amount increased or million in compared to  and remains in that range  due to managements assessment of the impact of deteriorating economic conditions 
the net effect on pre tax and pre noncontrolling interest income was an increase of or  to  compared to  in  which was a or  decrease compared to  in net interest income net interest income  a significant source of revenue  is the excess of interest income over interest expense 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets  and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  this represents a marked improvement over both and when net interest income was  and  respectively 
in the wake of historically low rates and compared to the two prior years  the year ended december  has been relatively stable 
we appear to be at  or near  the bottom of a period of economic downturn that began late in at that time  the federal reserve open market committee fomc  which sets the federal funds rate  began to decrease target funds in an effort to stabilize the economy and head off a recession 
to that end they decreased the target funds rate three times for a total of basis points between september and december of and an additional five times in for an additional basis points  which has resulted in the historically low federal funds rate of  in december the federal funds target rate has remained at throughout and wall street journal prime wsjp  which moves in tandem with the federal funds target rate  has held at 
we have utilized this period of stability to reengineer our portfolio with regard to product mix and interest rate 
in and  our margin was severely compressed because we were asset sensitive  which meant  that our interest income producing products assets were re pricing to lower levels at a quicker pace than the underlying products used to fund those assets 
our largest segment of interest earning assets is our loan portfolio  the majority of which is historically indexed off of wsjp and set to re price quickly 
over the past fifteen months  we have negotiated a majority of our commercial and mortgage loans to include rate floors which limit how low an interest rate can go  despite how a loan is indexed 
in addition  we have renegotiated the price of our interest bearing liabilities to lower and longer terms which will be favorable to us in the future when rates begin to rise 
the goal of these changes is to move us away from asset sensitivity to a more neutral funding position 
total interest income was  in compared to  in and  in establishing floors  which are the contractually defined minimum rate that can be charged on variable rate loans  is one of the ways a traditionally asset sensitive lender can neutralize that sensitivity and buffer the impact of falling rates 
another alternative to establishing floors is to offer fixed term loans with shortened maturities and a slightly higher rate  to allow for more frequent re pricing that is less market sensitive 
interest and fees on loans are the largest component of our interest income 
at december   million  or of our commercial and real estate loans  excluding the majority of our home equity line loans  were either fixed rate loans with maturities of a year or less or floors  with an average yield of compared to  or million at an average rate of at december  total interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  and  respectively for and interest bearing deposits represent of interest bearing liabilities  and in both and  time deposits represent roughly of interest bearing deposits 
through maturity re pricing  the average cost of our time deposits have declined from in to in and in  while average maturities have been extended from months in to year in additional analysis with regard to interest income will reference the following tables 
for discussion purposes  our net interest income analysis and our changes in net interest income rate volume analysis tables are adjusted to include tax equivalent income on bank owned life insurance boli that is not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of our income statement presentation to these tables

the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income  ie the fte adjustment and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin 
table depicts interest income on average earning assets and related yields  as well as interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid for the periods indicated 
our net yield on earning assets or net interest margin  which is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets  was in compared to and in and  respectively 
our earning asset yield decreased basis points in to compared to a basis point decrease to in from the rate of 
during the same periods liability costs were in  and in and  respectively  for a decline of basis points in compared to a basis point decline in our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average cost on interest bearing liabilities  was in  compared to in and in the result of these changes is a basis point improvement in margin for compared to a basis point compression in comparing the three year decrease of basis points in our earning asset yield to the decrease in the index reveals that we have been able to soften  through portfolio management strategies  the effect of the basis point wsjp rate decline 
from the cost side  we have lowered rates and lengthened maturities to help buffer the impact of a potential increase in rates

the goal of a rate volume analysis is to compare two or more earning periods to determine whether the difference between the results of those periods is due to changes in rate  or volume  or some combination of the two 
this is achieved through a what if analysis 
we calculate what the potential income would have been in the new period if the prior period rate had remained unchanged  and compare that result to what the potential income would have been in the prior period if the current rates were in effect 
through the analysis of these income potentials  we are able to determine how much of the dollar change between periods is due to the impact of differing rates and how much is volume driven 
net interest income has been adjusted to include income from boli 
our net interest income improved in compared to due to contributions of rate and volume 
changes in rate provided additional income of million or of income growth and increased volume provided an additional million  for a rounded increase of million 
comparing to  net interest income declined thousand as changes in rate reduced income million  outpacing growth contributions of million 
analysis of the interest income component of compared to net interest income reveals that asset growth was the primary driver of income  contributing a potential million  while declining rates reduced that potential by million for a net benefit of million 
asset growth was in average loans which increased million over prior year 
comparing to for interest income  declining rates reduced income potential by million offsetting potential growth benefits of million for a thousand reduction in interest income 
consumer loan income contributed million from loan growth and thousand from rate increases to interest income in the year ended december  included in our consumer loans are home equity loans and our loans held for sale 
in activity in our loans held for sale  which consist of pre sold mortgage loans that have been funded and are awaiting investor purchase was at a record high with closings of billion 
most of these loans are held for days or less 
during the year ended december  the income contribution from consumer loans was significantly less  at thousand 
growth in consumer loans provided an income potential of million that was nearly offset by a million decline in income potential from falling rates related to our home equity loans  which are wsjp indexed and at that time did not carry rate floors 
lower interest expense was the greatest source of the increase in net interest income in compared to  with savings due to lower rates creating the potential expense reduction of million to income while additional growth reduced that reduction potential by million 
deposits  which are the primary source of interest expense  grew an average of million in at a potential cost of million which was more than offset by a million savings potential due to rate reductions 
in comparing to reductions in interest expense on deposits  lower rates contributed a potential million in savings but average growth of million created million in additional expense for an increase in interest expense on deposits of thousand 
when comparing to  the greatest savings in interest expense was in our time deposits 
in spite of an average million in time deposit growth which created a potential thousand in additional interest expense  we were able to achieve a potential savings due to lower rates of million for a net savings of million 
money market accounts increased an average of million in for a potential interest expense increase of thousand but lower interest rates created a potential savings of million for a net savings of million 
in  declining money market balances coupled with declining rates provided an interest expense savings of million that was offset by significant growth in time deposits 
average growth in time deposits in was million for a potential increase in interest expense of million that outpaced the savings potential of million from rate for an actual increase in time deposit interest expense of million

our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility  and our primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility are to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is composed of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of our earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
we also consider the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in table reflects our assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
interest bearing demand deposits and money market balances are considered interest sensitive for of the outstanding balances 
management believes this structure makes for a more accurate and meaningful view of our interest sensitivity position 
as illustrated in the table  monarch appears asset sensitive for three months or less  primarily due to loan products that are identified as having adjustable rates 
however  this asset sensitivity has been mitigated by floors that have been placed on the majority of our adjustable rate commercial and real estate loan portfolio 
to balance this  we have also kept a portion of the maturities on our borrowings short  allowing for pricing flexibility

simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising and falling interest rates in increments and decrements of  and to determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve months 
alco also measures the effects of changes in interest rates on mve by discounting future cash flows of deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
loan and investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates up and down  and on net interest income and on mve as of december  in thousands 
the projected changes in net interest income to changes in interest rates at december  were in compliance with established guidelines for both increases and decreases of  and 
the projected changes in mve to changes in interest rates at december   were in compliance with established policy guidelines for increases of  and  and decreases in rate of  as well 
however  the projected changes in income were not in compliance for a decrease in rate of or 
these projected changes in the mve model are based on numerous assumptions of growth and changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that our net interest income would rise if rates increase and fall if rates decline 
the simulation analysis supports the actions that management has made with regard to the introduction of rate floors and short term fixed pricing on loans coupled with deposit rate and term adjustments to position the company in a rate neutral position 
we continue to focus on compliance through the tightening of lending guidelines and the establishment of floors for certain products

in august  we sold our ownership interest in virginia asset group  llc vag to the minority shareholder 
we continue to offer investment services  on a smaller scale  through our investment division  monarch investments 
a non recurring gain of  was included in our investment and insurance commissions in due to the merger of the broker dealer  bi investments  llc  into infinex financial  llc 
following this merger  monarch investment  llc  owns a interest in infinex financial  llc 
service charges continued to grow with deposits 
the fees charged in connection with our overdraft nsf program  which allows retail clients to overdraw their accounts without the negative stigma associated with a returned check  also increased 
this program was initiated in with broad customer acceptance 
recent changes by the federal reserve to regulation e that will limit the ability of banks to charge fees for paying overdrafts caused by atm and debit card transactions could have a negative impact on this program in the future 
service charge pricing on deposit accounts is typically reevaluated annually to reflect current costs and competition 
there were no security gains or losses in net security losses in were related primarily to the sale of a poorly performing corporate debt security in the fourth quarter which carried a loss of  gains related to rate calls on discounted securities totaled  in the net loss on other real estate in was the result of the write down of two foreclosed properties of  offset by a net gain of  on the sale of ten additional foreclosed properties

our expansion of mortgage operations continued in with the addition of offices 
in addition we opened a banking office  hired additional lenders and support staffing which has increased the number of our employees by at december   we employed a total of full and part time employees compared to and at year end and  respectively 
in addition  higher production related commissions and compensation related benefits such as social security taxes and medicare taxes expenses have contributed to the increase 
the expansion of our mortgage operations has been the major contributor to the growth in loan expense 
costs associated with underwriting and processing mortgage loans at our current volume are significant 
additionally  expense related to the shipping of mortgage loan packages to secondary market investors has had an impact on postage 
bank related loan expense decreased in due to lower loan volume 
federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance expense increased significantly in due to external factors in the banking sector 
the fdic is an independent agency of the united states government that provides insurance on all bank deposits up to a specified dollar level 
the standard insurance is currently thousand per depositor  which represents a temporary increase from the standard thousand for most accounts 
this temporary increase is in response to the current economic climate 
in addition  banks failed in compared to in and in as members of the fdic insurance program the remaining banks are required to cover the costs associated with higher coverage and bank closures 
in  the fdic increased the basic premiums a bank pays on a quarterly basis which  coupled with our deposit growth  resulted in an approximate thousand in fdic insurance expense 
in  the fdic added a special assessment which cost monarch an additional thousand 
occupancy plus furniture and fixture expense has increased as a result of expansion 
we currently have thirty two offices  the majority of which we lease 
this compares with twenty seven office locations in and twenty in as a virginia bank  we are subject to franchise tax  as opposed to income based state tax 
franchise tax is based on capital levels with certain allowable exclusions 
as we continue to grow and increase capital levels  our franchise taxes will also increase 
in  we have incurred a notable increase in data processing expenses 
this increase is the result of a combination of factors including footprint growth and new technology 
as part of our disaster recovery plan  we moved much of our data processing to a remote co location or colo site in we continue to focus on controlling overhead expenses in relation to income growth 
the efficiency ratio  a productivity measure used to determine how well non interest expense is managed  was in  compared to in  and  in the bank only efficiency ratio was in  compared to in  and in a lower efficiency ratio indicates more favorable expense efficiency 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expense by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and non interest income 
the expansion of our non interest income lines of business has negatively impacted this ratio

the major difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate results from income that is not taxable and expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
the primary non taxable income is from bank owned life insurance and the primary non deductible expenses are for meals and entertainment 
segment reporting our reportable segments include community banking and retail mortgage banking services 
community banking involves making loans to and generating deposits from individuals and businesses in the markets where we have offices 
our mortgage banking services consist of originating residential loans and subsequently selling them to investors 
our mortgage banking segment is a strategic business unit that is managed separately from the community banking segment because the mortgage banking services segment appeals to different markets and  accordingly  requires different technology and marketing strategies

we do not participate in highly leveraged lending transactions  as defined by the regulators  and there are no loans of this nature recorded in the loan portfolio 
we do not have foreign loans in our portfolio 
at december   we had loan concentrations loans to borrowers engaged in similar activities which exceeded of total loans in two areas 
these areas of concentration are to borrowers who are principally engaged in the acquisition  development and construction of single family homes and developments and to residential home owners with equity lines

our management is responsible for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by the board of directors 
among other factors  we consider on a quarterly basis our historical loss experience  the size and composition of our loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits including impaired loans and our risk rating based loan watch list  and national and local economic conditions 
the economy of our trade area is well diversified 
there are additional risks of future loan losses that cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those factors include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the sum of these elements is our management s recommended level for the allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is based on loss factors that cannot be associated with specific loans or loan categories 
these factors include management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  external audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio segments  etc 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
we developed a methodology to determine an allowance to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio based on evaluations of the collectability of loans  historical loss experience  peer bank loss experience  delinquency trends  economic conditions  portfolio composition  and specific loss estimates for weaker risk rated loans 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
based on management s evaluation  estimated loan loss allowances are assigned to the individual loans which present a greater risk of loan loss 
if necessary  reserves would be allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow 
any reserves for impaired loans are measured based on the present rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
we evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
a composite allowance factor that considers our and other peer bank loss experience ratios  delinquency trends  economic conditions  and portfolio composition are applied to the total of commercial and commercial real estate loans not specifically evaluated 
the remaining loan loss allowance is allocated to the remaining loans on an overall portfolio basis based on industry and or historical loss experience 
the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage loans  and home equity loans are not individually reviewed and are generally risk graded at the same levels 
the risk grade and reserves are established for each homogenous pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs from a current trend in delinquencies  losses or historical experience and general economic conditions 
in  we accrued  in provision for loan losses compared to  in based on the current economic environment and the composition of our loan portfolio  the level of our charged off loans combined with our peer bank loss experience  we considered this provision to be a prudent allocation of funds for our loan loss allowance

the allowance for loan losses totaled  at december   an increase of over december  the ratio of the allowance to loans  less unearned income  was at december  and at december  the allowance to loans ratio is supported by the level of non performing loans  the seasoning of the loan portfolio  and the growing experience of the lending staff in the market 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any inherent losses on existing loans in our loan portfolio at december  see note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k for more information concerning our loan loss and recovery experience

we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by recoveries from losses 
charged off loan balances are subtracted from the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on a quarterly basis 
various factors as defined in the previous section allowance and provision for loan losses are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status after they are past due for days 
non performing loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments  and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings  and these are detailed in table total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were and at december  and december   respectively 
there were twenty three loans totaling  in non accrual status at december  and three loans at december  totaling  all of these loans have been identified as impaired according to accounting standards codification  receivables 
a loan is considered impaired if it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we have provided specific reserves for these loans in our allowance for loan loss of  at december   and  in we recognized interest income on these loans of  and  in and  respectively

deposits provide funding for our investment in loans and securities 
our primary objective is to increase core deposits as a means to fund asset growth at a lower cost 
interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
we offer individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money market  and certificates of deposit

non interest bearing demand deposits  which continue to be a focus due to their low cost  grew an average million or in savings accounts increased an average of million in due to a higher yielding savings product that was introduced in in we developed a rising rate cd product with a two year maturity and three built in rate increases that allowed us to retain lower cost deposits in the short term and attempt to match the rate increases with anticipated changes in the market 
this product brought in million in cds  with overall growth partially offset by other cd runoff 
in we developed two higher yielding products in areas that have traditionally offered lower rates  an interest bearing demand account and savings account 
in response  interest bearing demand deposits increased million on average with an average rate increase of over and average savings deposits have increased million with average rate increase of 
non interest bearing demand deposits increased an average of million 
we are a participant in the federal deposit insurance transaction account guarantee program which provides that through june   our clients receive unlimited coverage for balances in their non interest bearing deposits 
stiff competition in the industry for money market accounts coupled with a level of migration to other products we offer have resulted in a limited growth in average money market accounts

liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through short term borrowings 
our liquidity is provided from cash and amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other banks  repayments from loans  increases in deposits  lines of credit from the federal home loan bank and five correspondent banks  and maturing investments 
as a result of our management of liquid assets  and our ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  we believe that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet clients credit needs 
we also take into account any liquidity needs generated by off balance sheet transactions such as commitments to extend credit  commitments to purchase securities and standby letters of credit 
we monitor and plan our liquidity position for future periods 
liquidity strategies are implemented and monitored by our asset liability committee alco 
cash  cash equivalents and federal funds sold totaled million as of december   an increase of  from the year ended december  at december   cash  securities classified as available for sale and federal funds sold were million or of total earning assets  compared to million or of total earning assets at december  we have additional sources of liquidity available to us including the capacity to borrow additional funds through several established arrangements 
further information on borrowings is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
in the course of operations  due to fluctuations in loan and deposit levels  we occasionally find it necessary to purchase federal funds on a short term basis 
we maintain unsecured federal funds line arrangements with five other banks  which allow us to purchase funds totaling  these lines mature and reprice daily 
no federal funds purchased existed at december   while at december   we had  in federal funds purchased 
we also have access to the federal reserve bank of richmond s discount window should a liquidity crisis occur 
we have not used this facility in the past and consider it a backup source of funds 
we are a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and as such  may borrow funds under a line of credit based on criteria established by the fhlb 
this line of credit would allow us to borrow up to of assets  or approximately  if collateralized  as of december  we currently pledge loans and investment securities to secure this line 
blanket liens pledged on certain designated loan portfolios amounted to million at december  and million at december  additionally  investment securities with carrying values of thousand at december  and thousand at december  were pledged to secure any borrowings 
based on pledged collateral we had a line of million at december  this line was reduced by million  which has been pledged as collateral for public deposits 
should we ever desire to increase the line of credit beyond the limit  the fhlb would allow borrowings of up to of total assets once we met specific eligibility criteria 
in february  we negotiated an additional line of credit with fhlb that was secured by specific loans held for sale lhfs 
we pledge these loans  which have been sold to fhlb approved investors  as collateral 
in return  we are allowed to borrow up to of these loans for days 
we had  of fhlb borrowings outstanding on our primary line and  outstanding on our lhfs line on december   and  outstanding on our primary line as of december  we had  in daily rate borrowings which re price daily and matures july   and  in two fixed term advance contracts outstanding on december  the first advance  which was used to match fund several amortizing longer term fixed rate loans  matures on september  and bears interest of at december  the second advance matures on november   bears a fixed interest rate of 
advances on the lhfs line are re priced daily 
outstanding advances on are as follows balance outstanding advance date original amount total advance capital resources we review the adequacy of our capital on an ongoing basis with reference to the size  composition  and quality of our resources and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards 
we seek to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and absorb potential losses 
in november  we raised a net of million in capital through the sale of  shares of par value  series b noncumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock  in a public offering 
the stock carries a conversion feature for the stock holder for shares of our common stock which reflects an initial conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to certain adjustments 
the stock also carries a conversion feature for the company that allow us to exercise our conversion right if  for trading days within any period of consecutive trading days  the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the then applicable conversion price of the series b preferred stock 
the stock has a liquidation preference of per share plus an amount equal to the sum of all declared  accrued and unpaid dividends 
in december  we were approved for and received million from the us treasury department under the tarp capital purchase program 
under this program we issued  shares of series a   liquidation value  cumulative perpetual preferred stock 
this stock carried a dividend for each of the first years of the investment  and thereafter  and certain warrants on our common stock 
in december  we repurchased all of our series a cumulative perpetual preferred stock from the us treasury department 
in june  we raised million net in capital through the sale of  shares of our common stock in two private placements 
selling shareholders were accredited investors and included certain qualifying insiders 
these insiders were members of our board of directors and senior management whose purchases were made in accordance with nasdaq capital market guidelines 
on july   we issued trust preferred subordinated notes in the amount of  through a private transaction 
these notes  which are non dilutive to common stock  may be included in tier i capital for regulatory capital determination purposes 
the notes have a libor indexed rate which adjusts  and is payable  quarterly 
the rate on the notes at december  was 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with pnc bank of pittsburgh to fix this rate at for five years 
the trust preferred subordinated notes may be redeemed at par beginning on september  this capital was used for general corporate purposes to support the continued growth 
on april   we announced an offering of a minimum of  shares and a maximum of  shares of common stock at a pre established price of per share 
the offering ran until may  with the full  shares sold 
this capital was used for general corporate purposes to support the continued growth 
the federal reserve  the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance bank adopted capital guidelines to supplement the existing definitions of capital for regulatory purposes and to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
at december   the required minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets was  of which must be tier one capital 
tier capital includes stockholders equity  retained earnings and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less certain goodwill items 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio was  which is well above the regulatory minimum of and the well capitalized minimum of 
further information on capital adequacy for the company may be found in note of monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
all share and per share amounts are retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend and splits 
off balance sheet transactions we enter into certain financial transactions in the ordinary course of performing traditional banking services that result in off balance sheet transactions 
our off balance sheet transactions recognized as of december  were a letter of credit to secure public funds  commitments to extent credit and standby letters of credit 
our letter of credit to secure public funds was from the federal home loan bank  and was for million at december  and commitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments under existing lines of credit amounted to million at december  and million at december   which represent legally binding agreements to lend to clients with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue guaranteeing the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
at december  and december   we had million and million respectively  in outstanding standby letters of credit 
we do not have any off balance sheet subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
there were no commitments to purchase securities at december  or december  we and our subsidiaries have twenty six non cancellable leases for premises 
further information on lease commitments is contained in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those applications of accounting principles or practices that require considerable judgment  estimation  or sensitivity analysis by management 
in the financial service industry  examples  though not an all inclusive list  of disclosures that may fall within this definition are the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  valuation of derivatives or securities without a readily determinable market value  and the valuation of the fair value of intangibles and goodwill 
except for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and fair value estimations related to foreclosed real estate  we do not believe there are other practices or policies that require significant sensitivity analysis  judgments  or estimations 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
our critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth in note to monarch s financial statements included as an exhibit in this form k 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on gaap guidance which requires that losses be accrued when they have a probability of occurring and are estimable and that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various economic factors and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur may be mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified loans 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the unallocated allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
fair value measurements under gaap we are permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets  including loans held for sale  available for sale securities  rate lock commitments  and foreclosed real estate owned 
these assets are recorded at fair value or lower of cost or fair value  as applicable 
the fair values of loans held for sale are based on commitments from investors 
the fair values of available for sale securities are based on published market or dealer quotes for similar securities 
the fair values of rate lock commitments are based on net fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements 
the fair value of foreclosed real estate owned is estimated based on our evaluation of fair value of similar properties 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and subject to material changes that could impact our financial condition and results of operation 
non gaap presentations our management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
this is a non gaap financial measure which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
in referring to our net income  we are referring to income under gaap 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
we feel the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconcilement of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income under gaap is provided in those statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
due to this fact  the effects of inflation on our balance sheet are minimal  meaning that there are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
we feel that the most significant impact on financial results is changes in interest rates and our ability to react to those changes 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to measure  monitor and control interest rate risk 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by our board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
our board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  this committee develops guidelines and strategies that govern our asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while this committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling month horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given a  and basis point bp upward or downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the range of our net interest income sensitivity analysis and market value of portfolio equity sensitivity as of december  all of the results in the net interest income met the approved policy limits of our asset liability management policy 
the results of changes in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity indicate that downward shifts of and basis points would yield results that were not within the approved limits  while a downward shift of basis points and all increases in basis points would be within the approved limits 
we continue to focus its efforts on complying with approved limits 
table change in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity changes in net interest income changes in market value of portfolio equity change in interest rates amount percent amount percent up up up down down down our simulation model makes assumptions including the slope and timing of rate increases  the rates that drive certain financial instruments  prepayment assumption  etc 
represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the current rate environment 
represents the difference between market value of portfolio equity in the current interest rate environment 
at the end of  our interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could increase by on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
in our balance sheet grew by million 
deposit inflows  primarily in the form of money market accounts and certificates of deposits have provided the funding for the growth in the loan portfolio 
overall  we continue to have moderate interest rate risk to both falling and rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  we could expect an average positive impact to net interest income of  over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  the company could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  asset and liability growth  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flow 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on clients with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that our alco committee might take in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates
