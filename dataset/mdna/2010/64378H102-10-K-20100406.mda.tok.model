revenues declined in all segments with instant noodles decreasing  flour products decreasing and soybeans declining only 
the demand for our products decreased significantly and was responsible for of the revenue decline 
the price of our instant noodle also decreased and attributed to of the revenue decline 
although the global economy is recovering  the level of recovery is different from country to country and industry to industry 
as our products like flour  soybean powder and packing materials are upstream goods for the food industry  the recovery and growth of business is dependant on the recovery and growth of the downstream business to a great extent  which was reversing slowly 
in addition  the overseas market has not recovered as strongly as the domestic chinese market  which substantially affected our export sales and export price 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december   cost of goods sold was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the decrease was in line with the decrease in sales of our products 
for the year ended december   as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased to of sales as compared to of sales for that of the prior year 
for the year ended december   gross margin loss decreased to as compared to for the prior year

for the year ended december   the gain in this regard was million 
for the corresponding period of  the gain in this regard was million 
the determination of the change in the value of the derivatives requires the use of a complex valuation model and can fluctuate significantly between periods based on changes in the price of our shares and the time remaining in the life of the underlying financial instruments 
increase in our stock s market value increases the value of the derivative creating losses in our income statements and decrease in the stock s market value reduces the value of the derivatives creating gains in our income statements

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated from sales of flour  soybean products and instant noodles 
all of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
we determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions after considering whether a contract exists  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the contract have been fulfilled and delivered 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  now accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award 
under asc  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of asc  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have adopted the requirements of asc for the fiscal year beginning on december   and recorded the compensation expense for all unvested stock options 
contractual joint ventures a contractual joint venture is an entity established between the company and another joint venture partner  with the rights and obligations of each party governed by a contract 
currently  the company has established three contractual joint ventures with three chinese partners in china  with percentage of ownership ranging from to 
pursuant to each chinese joint venture agreement  each chinese joint venture partner is entitled to receive a pre determined annual fee and is not responsible for any profit or loss  regardless of the ownership in the contractual joint venture 
in view of such contracted profit sharing arrangement  the three contractual joint ventures are regarded as owned by the company 
hence  the company s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the contractual joint ventures 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  fasb issued fsp and fsp  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments now codified within asc  investments debt and equity securities 
asc provides greater clarity about the credit and noncredit component of an other than temporary impairment event and more effectively communicates when an other than temporary impairment event has occurred

under asc  an other than temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis
