these risks and uncertainties  as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations  are described in greater detail in item a of part i  risk factors  which  along with the previous discussion  describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
general 
our core business is acquiring and leasing pursuant to operating leases  commercial aircraft engines and related aircraft equipment  and the selective sale of such engines  all of which we sometimes refer to as equipment 
we have no current plans to enter into finance leases although we may do so in the future 
as of december   we had lessees in countries 
our portfolio is continually changing due to acquisitions and sales 
as of december   our total lease portfolio 
table of contents consisted of engines and related equipment  four aircraft and three spare engine parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
as of december   we also managed engines and related equipment on behalf of other parties 
on december   we entered into a joint venture called wolf with oasis international leasing usa  inc  which is now known as waha capital pjsc 
wolf completed the purchase of two airbus a aircraft from boeing aircraft holding company for a purchase price of million 
we actively manage our portfolio and structure our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased assets 
our leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet engines manufactured by cfmi  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engines 
these engines are the most widely used engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  mcdonnell douglas  bombardier and embraer aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  impairments and bad debts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  grouped by our activities  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  we do not recognize revenue until received 
we also estimate and charge to income a provision for bad debts based on our experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers may adversely affect future lease revenues 
as of december   all of our leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  we retain title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
we generally depreciate engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for equipment which is unlikely to be repaired at the end of its current expected life  and is likely to be disassembled upon lease termination  we depreciate the equipment over its estimated life to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
currently  engines having a net book value of million are depreciated using this policy 
it is our policy to review estimates regularly to more accurately expense the cost of equipment over the useful life of the engines 
on april and july  and again on july   we adjusted the depreciation for certain older engine types within the portfolio 
the change in depreciation estimate resulted in a million increase in depreciation in and on an annual basis will result in an increase in depreciation expense of million per year assuming no change in our portfolio 
the net effect of the change in depreciation estimate is a reduction in net income of million or in diluted earnings per share over what net income would have otherwise been had the change in depreciation estimate not been made 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by us  future write downs may be recorded or a loss may be realized upon sale of the equipment 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of our lease portfolio  we recognize the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
asset valuation 
in august of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards codification asc  property plant and equipment fasb asc  formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of generally be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
impairment is identified by comparison of undiscounted forecasted cash flows  including estimated sales proceeds  over the life of the asset with the asset s book value 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the book value  we write the asset down to its fair value 
we determine fair value by reference to independent appraisals  quoted market prices eg  an offer to purchase and other factors 
if the undiscounted forecasted cash flows and fair value of our long lived assets decrease in the future we may incur impairment charges 

table of contents accounting for maintenance expenditures and maintenance reserves 
use fees received are recognized in revenue as maintenance reserve revenue if they are not reimbursable to the lessee 
use fees that are reimbursable are recorded as a maintenance reserve liability until they are reimbursed to the lessee or the lease terminates  at which time they are recognized in revenue as maintenance reserve revenue 
our expenditures for maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that meet the criteria for capitalization are recorded as an addition to equipment recorded on the balance sheet

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued an amendment to fasb asc  consolidation  formerly sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
fasb asc is intended to address the effects on certain provisions of fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept in fasb asc  and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of interpretation r  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the interpretation do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this statement must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november  the company does not expect the adoption of fasb asc to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  which addressed the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
asu will require the companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific 
table of contents objective evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price 
asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and early adoption will be permitted 
the company is assessing the potential impact of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during  the fasb issued several asu s asu no 
through asu no 
except for those asu s discussed above  the asu s entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore do not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through borrowings secured by our equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively our primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
purchases of equipment including capitalized costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under our lease agreements  which comprise lease revenue and maintenance reserves  and are offset by interest expense 
note that cash received from reserves arrangements for some of our engines on lease are restricted per our debt arrangements 
the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while virtually all of our debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase  it is unlikely we could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in our earnings and operating cash flows 
revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of our assets were on lease at december  compared to approximately at december  the average utilization rate for the year ended december  was compared to a year ago 
if there is any increase in off lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates  there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations 
at december   notes payable consists of loans totaling million net of discounts of million payable over periods of months to approximately years with interest rates varying between approximately and excluding the effect of our interest rate derivative instruments 
the significant facilities are described below 
at december   we had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
we closed on this facility on november  and it replaced a million revolving credit facility for which the revolving period had ended on june  with a final maturity on june  the proceeds from the new facility  net of million in debt issuance costs  was used to pay off the balance remaining from the previous facility  with any shortfall made up from unrestricted cash balances 
as of december   million was available under this facility 
the revolving facility ends in november the interest rate on this facility at december  was one month libor plus 
under the revolver facility  all subsidiaries except west engine funding llc jointly and severally guarantee payment and performance of the terms of the loan agreement 
the maximum guarantee is million plus any accrued and unpaid interest  fees or reimbursements but is limited at any given time to the sum of the principal outstanding plus accrued interest and fees 
the guarantee would be triggered by a default under the agreement 
on august   we closed the asset backed securitization through a newly created  bankruptcy remote  delaware statutory trust  willis engine securitization trust west 
west issued and sold million of term notes and approximately million of series warehouse notes 
the series warehouse notes were increased by million to million on april  and were then converted to term notes of west on march  with the sale of 
table of contents million of series a notes and million of series b notes 
we used these funds net of a million discount on the series a notes to pay off the balance remaining of the series a and b notes of million  pay off million of our indebtedness related to the transfer of engines from us to west  pay transaction expenses of approximately million and received cash of approximately million for general corporate purposes 
interest on the series a and b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and  respectively 
the series a term notes expected maturity is march and the series b term notes expected maturity is march from march  to june   our investment banker  acting as our agent to sell the notes  was the holder of million of the series b notes 
on june   we secured a million senior term loan and used the loan proceeds to re purchase the series b from our investment banker 
the series b notes were pledged as collateral for the million senior term loan 
the loan is for a term of two years with maturity on july  and is structured as a bullet loan with no amortization with all amounts due at maturity 
the interest rate for the term loan is one month libor plus 
our investment banker continues to market the series b notes and in the event the series b notes are placed with an investor prior to july   the term loan will be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the series b notes 
we would be required to fund any difference between the amount owing under the million senior term loan and the amount of proceeds received from the sale of the series b notes 
any payment would be funded by the use of unrestricted cash reserves  from cash flows from ongoing operations and additional financing capacity if required 
any amounts received from the sale of the series b notes at less than par would be recorded as a loan discount and would be amortized over the remaining year term of the b notes 
any amounts received in excess of par would be recorded as a purchase premium and amortized over the remaining year term 
we are also currently discussing extending the term of this loan with our investment banker  which would allow more time for the marketing of the series b notes 
west s ability to make distributions and pay dividends to us is subject to the prior payments of its debt and other obligations and west s maintenance of adequate reserves and capital 
under west  cash is collected in a restricted account  which is used to service the debt and any remaining amounts  after debt service and defined expenses  are distributed to us 
additionally  maintenance reserve payments and lease security deposits are accumulated in restricted accounts and are not available for general use 
cash from maintenance reserve payments are held in the restricted cash account and are subject to a minimum balance established annually based on an engine portfolio maintenance reserve study provided by a third party 
any excess maintenance reserve amounts remain within the restricted cash accounts and are utilized for the purchase of new engines 
on december   we closed on a new million warehouse facility within west  consisting of million of series a floating rate notes and million of series b floating rate notes 
at december   million was available under these warehouse notes 
the series warehouse notes allow for borrowings during a three year term through december   after which it is expected that they will be converted to term notes of west 
interest on the series a notes and the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and  respectively 
the facility has a committed amount of million 
the series a notes mature approximately december and the series b notes mature approximately december at december   million of west term notes and million of west warehouse notes were outstanding 
the term notes are divided into million series a notes  million series a notes and million series b notes 
the warehouse notes are divided into million series a notes and million series b notes 
the assets of west  west engine funding llc and any associated owner trust are not available to satisfy our obligations or any of our affiliates 
west is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
west entered into a senior liquidity facility on december  which expires on the final maturity date of the series a term notes in march the facility is provided by our investment bank and the maximum facility size is of the outstanding series a notes and series a notes 
this facility replaced the requirement to maintain cash reserves for the a notes and the series a notes 
the facility may be drawn on any payment date should the cash flow at west be insufficient to pay interest on the series a notes  series a notes and any required hedge payments 
a commitment fee is payable on the facility 
the establishment of this facility resulted in the release of million of cash held previously in the senior restricted cash account in december on january   we closed on a new term loan for a four year term totaling million 
interest is payable at a fixed rate of and principal and interest is paid quarterly 
the loan is secured by engines 
the funds were used to pay down our revolving credit facility 

table of contents at december   we had warehouse and revolving credit facilities totaling approximately million compared to million at december  at december   and december   respectively  approximately million and million were available under these combined facilities 
the decrease in availability in was due to the reduction in the size of the revolving credit facility from million to million upon the renewal of the facility on november  as well as the drawdown of funds from the facilities to support engine purchases 
at december  and  one month libor was and  respectively 
approximately million of our debt is repayable during which includes the million senior term loan owed to our investment banker 
such repayments primarily consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
repayments are funded by the use of unrestricted cash reserves and from cash flows from ongoing operations 
the table below summarizes our contractual commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments under long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we have estimated the interest payments due under long term debt by applying the interest rates applicable at december  to the remaining debt  adjusted for the estimated debt repayments identified in the table above 
actual interest payments made will vary due to changes in the rates for one month libor 
the interest estimate excludes the effect of any derivative instruments in place at the balance sheet date 
approximately million of the above debt is subject to our continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  under these facilities  we can typically borrow to of an engine purchase and between and of an aircraft or spare parts purchase 
therefore we must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or we will not be permitted to draw on these facilities 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if we do not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  we may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we have paid deposits to secure the purchase during of four engines for a gross purchase price of million  for delivery in as at december   non refundable deposits paid related to this purchase commitment were million 
in october  we entered into an agreement with cfm international cfm to purchase new spare aircraft engines 
the agreement specifies that  subject to availability  we may purchase up to a total of cfm b and cfm b spare engines over a five year period  with options to acquire up to an additional engines 
our purchase orders with cfm for four engines represent deferral of engine deliveries originally scheduled for and are included in our commitments to purchase 
we entered into a new lease effective november  for our offices in novato  california that covers approximately  square feet of office space 
the total remaining rent commitment is approximately million and expires february  the sub lease of our premises in san diego  california expires in october our shanghai  china office lease expires in december we believe our equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain our level of operations through a decline in the level of internally generated funds  such as could result if the amount of equipment off lease increases or there is a decrease in availability under our existing debt facilities  would impair our ability to sustain our level of operations 
we are discussing additions to our capital base with our commercial and investment banks 
if we are not able to access additional capital  our ability to continue to grow our asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and our future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 

table of contents management of interest rate exposure at december   all but million of our borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to one month libor 
our equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue we realize under our leases and the interest rate that we pay under our borrowings 
we have entered into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk and not to speculate or trade in these derivative products 
we currently have interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between seven and months and fixed rates of between and 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was negative million and negative million  respectively  representing a net liability for us 
we record derivative instruments at fair value as either an asset or liability 
we use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
while substantially all our derivative transactions are entered into for the purposes described above  hedge accounting is only applied where specific criteria have been met and it is practicable to do so 
in order to apply hedge accounting  the transaction must be designated as a hedge and the hedge relationship must be highly effective 
the hedging instrument s effectiveness is assessed utilizing regression analysis at the inception of the hedge and on at least a quarterly basis throughout its life 
all of the transactions that we have designated as hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these hedges flows through earnings in the current period 
the hedge accounting for these derivative instrument arrangements increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
this incremental cost for the swaps effective for hedge accounting was included in interest expense for the respective periods 
we will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
we anticipate that we may hedge additional amounts of our floating rate debt during the next year

because of the question regarding collectability of amounts due under these leases  lease rent revenue for these leases have been recorded on a cash basis until such time as collectability becomes reasonably assured 
after taking into account the deferred amounts  island air owes us million in overdue rent related to february december we hold letters of credit for  which may be used to partially offset our claims against island air

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in libor rates would affect our cost of borrowing 
increases in interest rates  which may cause us to raise the implicit rates charged to our customers  could result in a reduction in demand for our leases 
alternatively  we may price our leases based on market rates so as to keep the fleet on lease and suffer a decrease in our operating margin due to interest costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
all but million of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
we estimate that for every one percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments  annual interest expense would increase or decrease million in  million per annum 
we hedge a portion of our borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
this hedging activity helps protect us against reduced margins on longer term fixed rate leases 
based on the implied forward rates for one month libor  we expect interest expense will be increased by approximately million for the year ending december   as a result of our hedges 
such hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect us from increases in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is possible that we can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
we are also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during   and  respectively    and of our total lease rent revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of our leases require payment in us dollars 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments
