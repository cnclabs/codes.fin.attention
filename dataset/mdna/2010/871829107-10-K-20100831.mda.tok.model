item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights weak economic conditions in the united states and canada combined with lower consumer confidence contributed to a difficult business environment in fiscal  however  this environment improved as the year progressed 
although these factors unfavorably impacted financial results in fiscal  improving sales trends in the second half of the year and our attention to cost control throughout the year helped us achieve earnings growth in fiscal we also settled an outstanding tax matter with the internal revenue service irs in the first quarter of fiscal and recorded gains on corporate owned life insurance coli policies  both of which positively impacted net earnings and earnings per share 
sysco s fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest to june th 
this resulted in a week year ending july  for fiscal and week years ending june  and june  for fiscal and  respectively 
sales increased in fiscal from the comparable prior year period to billion primarily due to the additional week included in fiscal and improving case volumes in the second half of the fiscal year 
these were partially offset by deflation  change in sales mix and weak economic conditions and the resulting impact on consumer spending 
deflation  as measured by changes in our product costs  was an estimated during fiscal the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by and sales from acquisitions within the last months favorably impacted sales by 
operating income increased to billion  a increase over the prior year  primarily driven by the additional week included in fiscal and a decrease in operating expenses 
operating expenses declined primarily due to reduced fuel costs and a favorable comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values year over year 
partially offsetting these operating expense declines were increases in pay related expenses and net company sponsored pension costs 
net earnings increased to billion  an increase over the comparable prior year period  primarily due to the factors discussed above including the additional week in fiscal and a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the one time reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs and the non taxable gains recorded on coli policies 
basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were both  an increase of from the comparable prior year period  primarily due to the factors discussed above including the additional week in fiscal both basic and diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted by per share in fiscal due to the one time reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs and the gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 
this compares to a per share negative impact to earnings per share in fiscal from the losses recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are primarily located throughout the united states  canada and ireland and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  hotel supply operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 
we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we served about of this approximately billion annual market 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food away from home  market represents approximately of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states 
this share grew from about in to nearly in and did not change materially until when it declined to the current level of 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately in calendar year and in calendar year real sales declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 

table of contents strategy we continue to invest in our core business to expand our market share and grow earnings 
we will continue to use our strategies to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy  handle and market products for our customers 
these strategies include sales growth we intend to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers  development of new customers  improving customer retention  the use of fold outs new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other sysco operating companies  investment in new technologies  the addition of more marketing associates and a disciplined acquisition program 
our business review program  which is designed to help our customers grow their business  and the size and expertise of our sales force are key factors in maintaining and growing sales 
we continue to improve our pricing models to ensure our pricing is market relevant in order to grow sales 
business transformation project we are developing and implementing an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes to further streamline our operations and reduce costs 
these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems 
erp implementations are complex and time consuming projects that involve substantial investments in system software and implementation activities over a multi year timeframe 
as is the case in most erp implementations  we expect that the implementation of our erp system will require transformation of business processes in order to realize the full benefits of the project 
we view the technology as an important enabler of this project  however the larger outcome of this project will be from transformed processes that standardize portions of our operations 
this will include the addition of a shared business service center to centrally manage certain back office functions which are currently duplicated at each operating company location 
productivity gains we continue to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers 
in our distribution centers we are focused on improving the speed and accuracy of processing orders by utilizing state of the art software and equipment 
we continue to implement and enhance truck routing programs to minimize miles driven and fuel consumed while increasing cases delivered on each truck route 
lowering procurement costs we intend to lower our cost of goods sold by leveraging sysco s purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end to end view of our supply chain 
our national supply chain initiative is focused on inventory levels  inbound freight costs  product costs  operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
a component of our national supply chain initiative is the use of redistribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in a geographic region 
we currently have two rdcs located in virginia and florida and have made initial investments to build two additional rdcs 
we are evaluating the most appropriate timing for the building of these rdcs  balancing both market conditions and the spending on our business transformation project discussed below 
our primary focus is on growing and optimizing our core foodservice distribution business in north america  however  we will continue to explore and identify opportunities to expand the core business by growth in new international markets and in other areas of business that complement our core foodservice distribution business 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 
business transformation project we have substantially completed the design and build phases of our business transformation project and we are currently testing the underlying erp system and processes 
implementation is anticipated to begin with the first operating company location in the first half of calendar and our shared business services center in fiscal implementation is anticipated to occur across the majority of our broadline and sygma operating companies by the end of fiscal although we expect the investment in the business transformation project to provide meaningful benefits to the company over the long term  the costs will exceed the benefits during the early stages of implementation  including fiscal we expect total cash outlay for the business transformation project to be approximately million 
approximately million of cash outlay was incurred in fiscal  of which approximately million was capitalized 
approximately million to million of cash outlay is expected in fiscal  of which approximately million to million will be capitalized

this resulted in a week year ending july  for fiscal and week years ending june  and june  for fiscal and  respectively 
because the fourth quarter of fiscal contained an additional week as compared to fiscal  our results of operations for fiscal are not directly comparable to the prior year 
management believes that adjusting the fiscal results of operations for the estimated impact of the additional week provides more comparable financial results on a year over year basis 
as a result  the results of operations discussion for fiscal presented below in certain instances discusses operating items that have been adjusted by one fourteenth of the total metric for the fourth quarter  except as otherwise noted with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share 
failure to make these adjustments would cause the year over year changes in certain metrics such as sales  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share to be overstated  whereas in certain cases  a metric may actually have declined on a more comparable year over year basis 
our results of operations discussion includes reconciliations of the actual results for fiscal to the adjusted results for fiscal based on a week fiscal year 

table of contents sales sales for fiscal were higher in fiscal than fiscal  however the additional week contributed approximately to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal set forth below is a reconciliation of actual sales growth to adjusted sales growth decline for the periods presented see further discussion at impact of week fiscal year above weeks sales for the week periods estimated sales for the additional week adjusted sales actual percentage increase adjusted percentage decrease in addition to the extra week in fiscal  improving case volumes increased sales 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal sales from acquisitions within the last months favorably impacted sales by for fiscal product cost deflation and the resulting decrease in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal estimated changes in product costs  an internal measure of deflation or inflation  were estimated as deflation of during fiscal a change in customer sales mix as compared to fiscal also negatively impacted fiscal sales 
case volumes increased at a greater rate within our contract based customer group which generally receives lower pricing for higher volume 
sales for fiscal were less than fiscal product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal estimated product cost increases  an internal measure of inflation  were approximately during fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by compared to fiscal non comparable acquisitions offset the rate of sales decline by for fiscal our sequential quarterly sales trend demonstrated a decline throughout most of fiscal  all of fiscal and into the second quarter of fiscal  ranging from a positive in the first quarter of fiscal to a negative in the first quarter of fiscal our sales trend turned positive in the third quarter of fiscal to as compared to the third quarter of fiscal  a result largely driven by improving case volumes and favorable foreign exchange rates 
this positive trend continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal we experienced estimated product cost inflation during the four quarters of fiscal ranging from to 
during fiscal  we experienced estimated product cost deflation of approximately 
during the four quarters of fiscal  we experienced product cost deflation in the first three quarters of the fiscal year as high as and product cost inflation in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year of 
we believe the weak economic conditions experienced in fiscal and much of fiscal  which placed pressure on consumer disposable income  are constricting growth in the foodservice market and  in turn  have contributed to reduced sales growth rates 
while economic conditions are showing signs of improvement  we believe consumer disposable income will remain under pressure  which could continue to affect sales 
we believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities  commitment to quality  investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthening customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers 
we also believe these activities help our customers in this difficult economic environment 
operating income cost of sales primarily includes our product costs  net of vendor consideration  and includes in bound freight 
operating expenses include the costs of facilities  product handling  delivery  selling and general and administrative activities 
fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins  fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 
operating income increased in fiscal from fiscal to billion  and as a percentage of sales  increased to of sales 
this increase in operating income was primarily driven by the additional week included in fiscal and a decrease in operating expenses 
gross margin dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  while operating expenses decreased in fiscal set forth below is a reconciliation of actual operating income to adjusted operating income for the periods presented see further discussion at impact of week fiscal year above 
table of contents weeks operating income for the week periods estimated operating income for the additional week adjusted operating income actual percentage increase adjusted percentage increase operating income decreased in fiscal from fiscal to billion  or of sales 
operating income declined primarily due to a decline in sales  partially offset by a decline in operating expenses 
gross margin dollars decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses decreased in fiscal gross margin dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the additional week included in fiscal in addition  gross margins reflected product cost deflation in fiscal as compared to product cost inflation in fiscal we may be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup 
as a result  our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation  even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
gross margin dollars for fiscal were also impacted by lower fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million lower in fiscal than fiscal assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we do not expect fuel surcharges to change significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin dollars for fiscal and fiscal were impacted by product cost inflation 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sysco began experiencing high levels of product cost increases in numerous product categories 
these increases persisted throughout fiscal at levels approximating and rose even higher to in the first weeks of fiscal the level of product cost increases began moderating during the third quarter of fiscal and was in the fourth quarter of fiscal generally  sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers  however  because of contractual and competitive reasons  we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately 
prolonged periods of high inflation  such as those experienced in fiscal and fiscal  have a negative impact on our customers  as high food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market 
as a result  these factors may negatively impact our sales  gross margins and earnings 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal over fiscal usage of these surcharges was greater in the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  due to sustained  increased market diesel prices during that period 
operating expenses for fiscal were lower than in fiscal primarily due to reduced fuel costs and a favorable comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in both periods 
partially offsetting these operating expense declines were increases in pay related expenses  net company sponsored pension costs and approximately million of expense associated with the additional week included in fiscal operating expenses for fiscal were lower than in fiscal primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower payroll expense related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation 
the positive impact of these expense reductions was partially offset by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables 
in addition  our fuel costs increased during fiscal compared to fiscal sysco s fuel costs decreased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to decreased contracted diesel prices 
our fuel costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices 
sysco s costs per gallon decreased in fiscal over fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal over fiscal sysco s activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques  improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
we periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes for a portion of the fiscal year 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 

table of contents as of july   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through september these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
we adjust the carrying values of our corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis 
the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments  which include publicly traded securities 
as a result  the cash surrender values of these policies will fluctuate with changes in the market value of such securities 
the changes in the financial markets resulted in gains for these policies of million in fiscal  compared to losses for these policies of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the performance of the financial markets will continue to influence the cash surrender values of our corporate owned life insurance policies  which could cause volatility in operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
the provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal and increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in our provision for losses on receivables in fiscal reflects fewer customer accounts exceeding our threshold for write off in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  the economic conditions and related decrease in consumer demand combined with tightening credit markets impacted the liquidity of some of our customers  resulting in an increase in delinquent payments on accounts receivable 
the increase in our provision for losses on receivables in fiscal was related to customer accounts across our customer base without concentration in any specific location 
customer accounts written off  net of recoveries  were million  or of sales  million  or of sales  and million  or of sales  for fiscal  and  respectively 
our provision for losses on receivables will fluctuate with general market conditions  as well as the circumstances of our customers 
pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project  increased by million in fiscal from fiscal and decreased by million in fiscal from fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily due to increased provisions for management incentive accruals and cost associated with the additional week included in fiscal partially offsetting these increases were lower pay related expenses due to reduced headcount 
the fiscal decline was due to a combination of reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation 
the criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance 
in fiscal  the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses was met  therefore  the provision for current management incentive bonuses was higher in fiscal than in fiscal when the company assessed it did not meet the criteria for paying certain annual bonuses 
in fiscal  the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses were not met  therefore  corporate executive officers did not receive bonuses for fiscal and operating company management bonuses were at lower levels for fiscal as compared to fiscal headcount declines occurred due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales 
headcount was lower at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal and lower at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were million higher than in fiscal net company sponsored pension costs were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to lower returns on assets of sysco s company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to lower returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan during fiscal and the merging of participants from a multi employer pension plan to the retirement plan  partially offset by a decrease in expense due to an increase in the discount rates used to calculate the plan s liabilities and amendments to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal are expected to increase by approximately million over fiscal due primarily to a decrease in discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense  partially offset by reduced amortization of expense from actuarial gains from higher returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan during fiscal expenses related to our business transformation project  inclusive of pay related expense  increased by million in fiscal from fiscal our business transformation project began in january  therefore  fiscal only included six months of activity 
sysco redeployed employees to work on the business transformation project and did not backfill all of these positions  therefore  not all expenses related to this project are incremental from operating expenses incurred by sysco in the applicable periods in the prior fiscal year 
additionally  certain labor costs  which would have been expensed absent this project  are being capitalized as software costs as a result of this project 
we believe the increase in total expense  including all 
table of contents pay related expenses  related to the business transformation project in fiscal as compared to fiscal will be approximately million to million 
we recorded provisions related to multi employer pension plans of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations  multi employer pension plans 
share based compensation expense decreased million in fiscal from fiscal contributing to the decrease in fiscal was reduction in the level of option grants being awarded compared to previous years  resulting in reduced compensation expenses being recognized 
also affecting the decrease in fiscal was the removal of the previous stock award component from the management incentive plan annual bonus awards beginning with fiscal as a result  the share based compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years was not incurred in fiscal  and overall share based compensation expense was reduced as compared to fiscal net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below  as well as the factors discussed above including the additional week in fiscal set forth below is a reconciliation of actual net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented see further discussion at impact of week fiscal year above weeks net earnings for the week periods estimated net earnings for the additional week adjusted net earnings actual percentage increase adjusted percentage increase net earnings declined in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below  as well as the factors discussed above 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate of for fiscal was favorably impacted by two items 
first  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million resulting from the one time reversal of a previously accrued liability related to the settlement with the irs see liquidity and capital resources  other considerations  bscc cooperative structure for additional discussion 
second  the gain of million  which had a tax impact of million  recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values in fiscal  was non taxable for income tax purposes and had the impact of decreasing the effective tax rate in the period 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was negatively impacted primarily by two factors 
first  we recorded tax adjustments related to federal and state uncertain tax positions of million 
second  the loss of million  which had a tax impact of million  recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values was non deductible for income tax purposes and had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the period 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of million previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately million resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change  million related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and million related to the reduction in net canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions  share based compensation expense and the recognition of losses of million  which had an unfavorable tax impact of million  recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 

table of contents earnings per share both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased in fiscal from the prior year 
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
these changes were primarily the result of factors discussed above including the additional week in fiscal  as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding 
the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases 
the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an increase in the number of anti dilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 
both basic and diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted by per share in fiscal due to the one time reversal of interest accruals for the tax contingency related to the irs settlement and the gains recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values 
this compares to a per share negative impact to earnings per share in fiscal from the losses recorded on the adjustment of the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values

the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item of this form k 
intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 
the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments 
these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 
management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results  which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs 
while a segment s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins  expenses  or a combination thereof  over the long term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth 
this is consistent with our long term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth

broadline segment the broadline reportable segment consists of the aggregated results of the united states  canadian and european broadline segments 
broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to customers 
broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco s operations 
in fiscal  the broadline operating results represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 

table of contents there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments 
we have invested substantial amounts in assets  operating methods  technology and management expertise in this segment 
the breadth of its sales force  geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment s earnings 
sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by compared to fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal product cost deflation  which led to decreases in selling prices  and a change in customer sales mix partially offset case volume improvement in fiscal the additional week also contributed to the sales growth in fiscal sales for fiscal were less than fiscal case volume declines attributable to the impact of the negative business environment caused a decline in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by compared to fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal product cost inflation  which led to increases in selling prices  partially offset case volume declines in fiscal operating income the increase in operating income in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods 
operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the additional week in fiscal contributed to the gross margin increase  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to less usage of these surcharges in fiscal expense performance for fiscal was primarily due to reduced fuel cost and lower provision for losses on receivables and operating efficiencies  such as reduced pay related expense due to reduced headcount 
fuel costs were million lower in fiscal than in the prior year 
partially offsetting these expense declines were increases in expenses related to the additional week in fiscal the increase in operating income in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to effective management of operations in the weak economic environment 
effective management was also evidenced by margins declining at a lower rate than our sales decline and by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods 
gross margin dollars decreased while operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal offsetting the gross margin decline was an increase in fuel surcharges of million as a result of increased usage of fuel surcharges in the first half of fiscal due to sustained increased market diesel prices 
expense performance for fiscal was aided by lower payroll related expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies  partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on receivables and increased fuel cost 
fuel costs were million higher in fiscal over fiscal we attempt to mitigate fuel costs by reducing miles driven  improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we expect fuel costs for our broadline segment to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal and we do not expect fuel surcharges to change significantly in fiscal as compared to fiscal we recorded provisions related to multi employer pension plans of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal sygma segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 
sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s other segments 
this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins 
these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 
sales sales were greater in fiscal than fiscal and greater in fiscal than in fiscal the additional week contributed to the sales growth in fiscal case volume improvement caused an increase in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal this case growth was largely attributable to new customers added largely in the latter part of the fiscal 
table of contents year and the additional week in fiscal partially offsetting these case volume improvements was a decline in volume from existing customers due to the weak economic environment which applied continued pressure to consumer discretionary spending and negatively impacted overall restaurant traffic counts 
product cost deflation  which led to decreases in selling prices also impacted fiscal sales growth 
in fiscal  sales growth was primarily due to significant contracts with new customers and product cost increases  which led to increases in selling prices 
these increases were partially offset by lost sales due to the elimination of unprofitable business and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting sygma s existing customer base 
one chain restaurant customer wendy s arby s group  inc accounted for approximately of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended july  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer 
while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma  we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 
operating income operating income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin dollars increased while operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the additional week in fiscal contributed to the gross margin increase  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower fuel prices in fiscal expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas  as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions 
also contributing to the decrease in operating expenses was a decrease of million in fuel costs in fiscal from the prior year due to lower fuel prices 
operating income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin dollars increased while operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal offsetting the gross margin increase  was a decrease of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal compared to fiscal expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas  as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions 
offsetting these expense declines were increased fuel costs of million in fiscal over fiscal assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment to increase as compared to fiscal other segment other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments  including our specialty produce  custom cut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers 
these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 
on an aggregate basis  our other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s broadline segment 
sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years 
these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry 
these operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment 
in fiscal  in the aggregate  the other segment represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 
operating income increased for fiscal from fiscal the increase in operating income was caused primarily by increased sales in our specialty produce segment and increased operating income in all segments due to favorable expense management 
the additional week in fiscal also contributed to the increase in operating income 
operating income decreased for fiscal from fiscal the decrease in operating income was caused primarily by reduced sales in all segments attributable to the deteriorating economic environment 
liquidity and capital resources sysco s strategic objectives require continuing investment  and our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is generally allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  systems  fleet  other equipment and technology  acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy  and cash dividends 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high quality  short term instruments or applied toward the cost of the share repurchase program 
as a part of our on going strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and 
table of contents sales of assets and businesses  and our overall capital structure 
these transactions may materially impact our liquidity  borrowing capacity  leverage ratios and capital availability 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future  including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months and beyond  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 
we have continued to maintain the highest credit rating available for us commercial paper 
we believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively as well as the long term capital markets  if necessary 
operating activities we generated billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal  billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the decrease of million between fiscal and fiscal was driven largely by million of payments related to the irs settlement and million of pension contributions made in advance for fiscal additionally  several less significant items had offsetting impacts when comparing the cash flow from operations between fiscal and fiscal as described under other considerations  bscc cooperative structure  we will continue to make payments under the irs settlement in fiscal and fiscal  in the amount of million per year 
if equivalent levels of net earnings are achieved in fiscal  we expect cash flows from operations to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was primarily due to net income and non cash depreciation and amortization expense  offset by decreases in accrued income taxes and other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
cash flow from operations in fiscal was primarily due to net income  non cash depreciation and amortization expense  an increase in accrued income taxes  and increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the increases in fiscal were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable balances and accrued expenses 
cash flow from operations in fiscal was primarily due to net income  changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
the increases in fiscal were reduced by decreases in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal was primarily due to sales growth 
the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal was primarily due to the sales decline 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal was primarily due to sales growth 
the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal was primarily from the growth in inventory resulting from sales growth 
the decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline 
the increase in accounts payable balances in fiscal was primarily due to inventory increases resulting from sales growth 
accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors  including changes in product mix  cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 
cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by an increase in accrued expenses of million during fiscal cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by decreases in accrued expenses of million during fiscal and million during fiscal the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation accruals resulting from improved operating performance in fiscal the remainder of the increase was driven by multiple changes in various other accruals  of which no item was individually significant 
the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses  offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses 
the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below 
this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixed rate debt issued in fiscal and an increase to a provision related to a multi employer pension plan 
see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at other considerations  multi employer pension plans 
in fiscal  we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of million within accrued expenses and a corresponding insurance receivable of million within prepaid expenses and other current assets 
in fiscal  these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment 
cash flow from operations for fiscal was negatively impacted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities of million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of million 
the main factor affecting both of these items  as well as cash taxes paid  was the irs settlement discussed below in other considerations  bscc cooperative structure  which resulted in the payment of taxes of million in fiscal for the settlement agreement as well as higher estimated tax payments for ongoing operations in fiscal offsetting the negative impact described above  the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities was impacted by the contribution of an additional million to our company sponsored qualified pension plan in fiscal for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal cash flow from operations for fiscal was positively impacted by an increase in accrued income taxes of million  partially offset by changes in

total cash taxes paid were  million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
other long term liabilities and prepaid pension cost  net  decreased million during fiscal  decreased million during fiscal and increased million during fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to three items 
first  pension contributions to our company sponsored plans exceeded net company sponsored pension costs 
second  our liability for deferred incentive compensation decreased due to accelerated distributions taken by plan participants of all or a portion of their vested balances pursuant to certain transitional relief under the provisions of section a of the internal revenue code and other regular distributions 
third  our liability for uncertain tax positions decreased as a result of the settlement with the irs  as well as a reclass to accrued income taxes for amounts expected to be paid in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax benefits related to our settlement with the irs 
see additional discussion of an irs settlement at other considerations  bscc cooperative structure 
the decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net company sponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals

financing activities equity we traditionally have engaged in board approved share repurchase programs 
the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were  shares for million in fiscal   shares for million in fiscal and  shares for million in fiscal an additional  shares were repurchased at a cost of million through august   resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to  shares  based on the trades made through that date 
on august   the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program covering an additional  shares 
our current share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our diluted average shares outstanding relatively constant 
based on forecasted share exercises pursuant to our option plans  we expect to repurchase more shares in fiscal than in fiscal dividends paid were million  or per share  in fiscal  million  or per share  in fiscal and million  or per share  in fiscal in may  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal of per share  which was paid in july in november  we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions

in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
total debt total debt as of july  was billion of which approximately was at fixed rates with a weighted average of and an average life of years  and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of

sysco was in compliance with all debt covenants as of july  other as part of normal business activities  we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements 
as of july  and june   letters of credit outstanding were million and million  respectively 
other considerations multi employer pension plans as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multi employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans  a plan s termination  our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multi employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi employer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
generally  sysco does not have the greatest share of liability among the participants in any of these plans 
based on the information available from plan administrators  which has valuation dates ranging from january  to june   we estimate our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi employer plans in which we participate could have been as much as million as of july  based on a voluntary withdrawal 
the majority of the plans we participate in have a valuation date of calendar year end 
as such  the majority of our estimated withdrawal liability results from plans for which the valuation date was december   therefore  our estimated liability reflects the asset losses incurred by the financial markets as of that date 
in general  the financial markets improved during calendar year  therefore  we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could differ from this estimate 
in addition  if a multi employer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements  the irs may impose a non deductible excise tax of on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund 
as of july   we have approximately million in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multi employer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal had already occurred 
required contributions to multi employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  the pension protection act  enacted in august  requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 
during fiscal  we obtained information that a multi employer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be 
table of contents required as well as the payment of excise tax 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded a liability of approximately million related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we effectively withdrew from this multi employer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this under funded plan 
we agreed to pay million to the plan  which included the minimum funding requirements 
in connection with this withdrawal agreement  we merged active participants from this plan into sysco s company sponsored retirement plan and assumed million in liabilities 
the payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal if this plan were to undergo a mass withdrawal  as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation  prior to september  we could have additional liability 
we do not currently believe a mass withdrawal from this plan prior to september is probable 
we have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multi employer pension plans 
total withdrawal liability provisions recorded include million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal bscc cooperative structure sysco s affiliate  baugh supply chain cooperative bscc  is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code  the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments 
the irs  in connection with its audits of our through federal income tax returns  proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts 
sysco reached a settlement with the irs in the first quarter of fiscal to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis  pay the amounts that were recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a three year period and make a one time payment of million  of which approximately million is non deductible 
the settlement addresses the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our through federal income tax returns  and settles the matter for all subsequent periods  including the and federal income tax returns already under audit 
as a result of the settlement  we will pay the amounts owed in the following schedule amounts paid annually in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal as noted in the table above  million was paid related to settlement in fiscal amounts to be paid in fiscal and will be paid in connection with our quarterly tax payments  two of which fall in the second quarter  one in the third quarter and one in the fourth quarter 
we believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand  cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments on all of the amounts noted above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of july   certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans unrecognized tax benefits and interest irs deferred tax settlement unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to commercial paper and debt retirement plan long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions 
as of july   we had a liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and million for related interest that could result in cash payment  of which million is expected to be paid during fiscal sysco reached a settlement with the irs in the first quarter of fiscal related to timing of tax payments 
apart from these items  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time 
accordingly  the related non current balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of july   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
the impact of our outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of july  provides the estimated minimum contribution to the retirement plan through fiscal to meet erisa minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year  based on actuarial assumptions 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed  including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of july  included million in cash 
this amount is not included in the table above 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  company sponsored pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  goodwill and intangible assets and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy  has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods 
allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
in addition  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  as was the case in fiscal  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
company sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased basis points to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes decreased our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the july  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes will increase our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
a basis point increase in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease sysco s net company sponsored pension cost by million  while a basis point decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by million 
the impact of a basis point increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a basis point decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates 
therefore  a basis point increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a basis point decrease in the discount rate 
we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
we used a plan specific age related set of rates for the retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of as of july  and as of june  for determining the benefit obligations as of july   the serp calculations use an age graded salary 
table of contents growth assumption 
as of june   the serp calculations use an age graded salary growth assumption with reductions taken for determining fiscal pay due to base salary freezes in effect for fiscal the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and fiscal the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds  historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately    and  over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net company sponsored pension costs for fiscal by approximately million 
pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of july  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  increased net company sponsored pension costs by approximately million in fiscal changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to increase net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal by approximately million 
we made cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the contributions in fiscal of million to the retirement plan included the minimum required contribution for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
the contributions in fiscal of million to the retirement plan were voluntary contributions 
we do not have a minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
we contributed million to the retirement plan in fiscal for contributions that would normally have been made in fiscal additional contributions to the retirement plan are not currently anticipated in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan is approximately million 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

table of contents vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in some instances  vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities 
we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold 
our inventory turnover is usually less than one month  therefore  amounts deferred against inventory do not require long term estimation 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
historically  adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our eight operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our eight operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into eight reporting units 
we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models 
the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our eight operating segments 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums  earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past  future cash flow estimates of the reporting units  which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital  along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
when possible  we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 
we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal  and our past estimates of fair value for fiscal  and have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results 
sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units 
in the fiscal analysis  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for our lodging industry products reporting unit if the estimated fair value for this reporting unit had been lower 
for the remainder of our reporting units  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 
the reporting units aggregated as other in the financial statement disclosures specialty produce  custom cut meat  lodging industry products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the broadline or sygma reporting units 
this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired  and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the broadline and sygma reporting units 
in addition  these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the broadline reporting units 
as such  these other reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and various non employee director plans 
as of july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company s stock price as of the date of grant 
for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents  the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date 
the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post vesting restriction 
the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans with respect to years prior to fiscal was based on the stock price on the last day of the fiscal year less a discount for post vesting restrictions 
the discount for post vesting restrictions was estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 
the stock award component of the management incentive plan bonus awards was removed beginning in fiscal the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan through fiscal was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus related 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
in those cases  we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in other cases  certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate 
in these cases  if it is probable that the performance condition will be met  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period  otherwise  we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 
in addition  certain of our share based awards provide that if the award holder retires at certain age and years of service thresholds  the options continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director 
in these cases  for awards granted prior to july  our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards  we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires 
for awards granted subsequent to july   we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings  the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business  sales and expense trends  anticipated multi employer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multi employer pension plans  expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest  expectations regarding share repurchases  expected trends in fuel pricing  usage costs and surcharges  our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable  our intention to lower our cost of goods sold by leveraging our purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end to end view of our

these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a above and elsewhere 
in addition  the success of sysco s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control 
our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control  including actions by our competitors and or customers 
as implementation of the erp system and the business transformation project begins  there may be changes in design or timing that impact near term expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget  and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required  which could also impact project expense and timing 
company sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors  including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time 
our plans with respect to growth in international markets and complimentary lines of business are subject to the company s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally 
legal proceedings are impacted by events  circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco 
the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated  stock repurchases at historical levels  or other unexpected cash requirements 
predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent  and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect  our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect  as well 
the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect  and laws and regulations  as well as methods of enforcement  are subject to change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
fiscal as of july   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our long term debt obligations as of july  were billion  of which approximately were at fixed rates of interest  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt swap 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt swap 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and increasing floating interest rate exposure 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
as of july   the swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets of million 
the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is and the floating interest rate on the swap is three month libor which resets quarterly 
as of july   the swap was recognized as an asset within the

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars 
our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars positively impacted sales by in fiscal compared to fiscal and negatively impacted sales by in fiscal compared to fiscal the impact to our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal and fiscal a unfavorable change in the fiscal weighted year to date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal sales by and would not have materially impacted our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our canadian financing subsidiary has the us dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in us dollars 
we have the potential to create taxable income in canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date 
a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
fuel price risk due to the nature of our distribution business  we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food away from home purchases 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  incurred by sysco decreased by approximately million in fiscal from fiscal and increased by million in fiscal over fiscal from time to time  we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
as of july   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through september these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel 
fuel costs in fiscal  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
a unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential increase to million to million 
investment risk sysco invests in corporate owned life insurance policies in order to fund certain retirement programs which are subject to market risk 
the value of our investments in corporate owned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments  which include publicly traded securities 
therefore  the value of these policies will be adjusted each period based on the performance of the underlying securities which could result in volatility in our earnings 
should the financial markets decline  we would take charges to adjust the carrying value of our corporate owned life insurance  and if the market declines are significant  these charges could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating expenses  net income and earnings per share 
a unfavorable change in publicly traded securities held within our investments in corporate owned life insurance would not have a material impact on our operating expenses  net income and earnings per share 
our company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan s liability 
fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and pension expense to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end  which is when this plan s funded status is measured 
also  the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets 
specifically  decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations 
to the extent the 
table of contents financial markets experience declines  our anticipated future contributions  pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years 
a unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company sponsored retirement plan at the plan s fiscal year end december  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal  however  this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal by million and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of july  by million
