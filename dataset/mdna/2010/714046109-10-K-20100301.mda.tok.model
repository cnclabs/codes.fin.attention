overview of fiscal year the global economic contraction negatively affected certain of our end markets during fiscal year  however  several of our other end markets performed better than we anticipated 
our overall sales in fiscal year declined million  or  as compared to fiscal year  reflecting a decline of million  or  in our human health segment sales and a decline of million  or  in our environmental health segment sales 
this decline in our human health segment sales during fiscal year was due primarily to decreased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market  as well as order deferrals related to fiscal year delays in government stimulus monies in the research market 
the decreased demand for our medical imaging products resulted from continued constraints on medical providers capital budgets  and a lack of financing availability for our customers 
the government stimulus related order delays in the research market resulted from many of our customers continuing to defer instrument purchases in hopes of obtaining grants for larger instrument purchases 
the decline in our environmental health segment sales during fiscal year was due primarily to the decline in spending by private and public testing labs  and continued weak demand in detection and intrusion sensors in the environmental and safety and security markets  as well as traditional chemical and semiconductor markets reducing capital purchases in response to continued tight capital budgets and difficulty accessing credit markets 
these declines have been offset in part by certain of our businesses operating in markets which are more isolated from current economic trends  or where our businesses have benefited from a push for more efficient spending 
in our human health segment  we experienced strong growth in sales in the diagnostics market related to our genetic screening business during fiscal year as compared to that market in fiscal year the genetic screening business was driven by continued expansion of neonatal and prenatal screening platforms  with broad based growth experienced across all major geographies 
we expanded newborn screening in china through our recent sym bio acquisition and also advanced adoption and capacity of first trimester prenatal screening  setting up national labs in new zealand  the philippines  vietnam and malaysia 
our cord blood business also contributed to the growth of our genetic screening business during fiscal year in the research market  demand for our reagents and low end instrumentation was encouraging as customers continued to spend on basic research 
as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers  we anticipate that while there is continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability  the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease  which can result in savings of long term health care cost as well as creating better outcomes for patients  are increasingly valued and we will continue to see growth in these markets 
in our environmental health segment  our laboratory services business enables our customers to drive efficiencies  increase production time and reduce maintenance costs  all of which are increasingly critical in this distressed economic environment 
during fiscal year  we continued to grow by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service and expanding in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services 
we were also encouraged by improving demand trends in our traditional service offerings which we believe are indicative of improving economic confidence 
while overall sales in the environmental and safety and security markets were driven down by the decline in spending by private and public testing labs and the decline in spending for detection and intrusion sensors  sales of environmental  food and consumer safety testing products grew in fiscal year due to increased demand for the production and analysis of renewable energy technologies and new testing requirements for consumer product safety applications as a result of new regulations 
we experienced increased demand from government agencies in china for products with food safety 
table of contents and consumer safety applications to comply with recently adopted regulatory requirements in the united states 
we believe that the need for increased inspection  testing and tracking of contaminants will continue to drive increased demand for our products 
our gross margins increased approximately basis points in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to changes in product mix  especially growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings  and cost containment initiatives  partially offset by lower demand 
however  our consolidated operating margin declined approximately basis points in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of lower demand  additional restructuring activities  increased sales and marketing expenses  particularly in emerging territories  increased pension expenses and foreign exchange  partially offset by cost containment initiatives 
we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of our end markets where spending trends have countered the prevailing downturn  and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services 
overall  we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets  deep portfolio of technologies and applications  leading market positions  global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation to weather the current economic climate

the restructuring plan for the first quarter of fiscal year was intended principally to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets 
the restructuring plan for the third quarter of fiscal year was intended principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy 
the activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations 
we expect the impact of immediate cost savings from the restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the decline in revenue 
we expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible  as we will incur offsetting costs

the following table summarizes the components of the q plan activity recognized by segment human health environmental health total in thousands severance closure of excess facilities total previous restructuring and integration plans the principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years through were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our human health and environmental health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy 
during fiscal year  we paid million related to these plans and recorded a reversal of million related to lower than expected severance costs for several of these plans 
as of january   we had approximately million of remaining liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans  primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities in both our human health and environmental health segments 
payments for these leases  the terms of which vary in length  will be made through fiscal year lease charges to facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year  we were required to guarantee the lease obligations that the buyer assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operated 
the lease obligations continue through march while we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business  the buyer subsequently defaulted under the lease  and the lessor sought reimbursement from us 
we recorded a charge of million in fiscal year related to payments for this lease obligation 
the buyer filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal year and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses 
the buyer ceased operations in the third quarter of fiscal year and vacated the property

in process research and development charge compared to in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
under this guidance  ipr d is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale 
we did not have an ipr d charge in fiscal years and compared to we did not have an ipr d charge in fiscal year the ipr d charge for fiscal year was million  which related to the acquisitions of evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa in january in determining the value of the in process projects  we considered  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the ipr d  using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset  including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life  and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined  represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date  and the amount represents management s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  consisted of the following in thousands interest income interest expense discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts gains on disposition of investments  net other expense  net total interest and other expense  net compared to interest and other expense  net for fiscal year was million  as compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million 
the decrease in interest and other expense  net  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts  with a million loss that was recognized into interest expense during fiscal year  as well as lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances  partially offset by the increase in the mix of fixed rate versus variable rate debt 
interest income decreased million as a result of lower interest rates on lower cash balances 
other expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year decreased by million  and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation 
a more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents compared to interest and other expense  net for fiscal year was million  as compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million 
the increase in interest and other expense  net  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts with a million loss that was recognized into interest expense during fiscal year  and higher outstanding debt balances  primarily related to our purchase of viacell in fiscal year  which was partially offset by lower interest rates on those outstanding debt balances 
interest income decreased million as a result of lower interest rates  which were partially offset by higher cash balances 
other expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year increased by million  and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation 
provision for income taxes compared to the fiscal year provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  as compared to a provision of million for fiscal year the effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the expected mix of profits from higher tax rate jurisdictions in as compared to fiscal year and reflects the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide in fiscal year in october  the tax relief and health care act of the tax act was enacted 
the tax act retroactively restored expired research and experimental tax credit provisions and extended the credit through december  as a result of the tax act  we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in fiscal years and in the amount of million for each year 
compared to the fiscal year provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  as compared to a provision of million for fiscal year the effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable settlement of an income tax audit in fiscal year discontinued operations as part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities  we have discontinued certain businesses 
we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and  accordingly  have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately  and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of january  and december  we recorded the following gains and losses  which have been reported as loss on disposition of discontinued operations during the three years ended january  december  december  in thousands gain loss on disposition of certain instrument businesses loss on disposition of viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses net loss on disposition of other discontinued operations net loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes loss on disposition of discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
table of contents as part of our new strategic business alignment into our human health and environmental health segments and our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities  in december  our management approved separate plans to divest our photonics and photoflash businesses within our environmental health segment 
photonics and photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and modules 
these products are used in a variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine tools 
the distressed economic conditions during fiscal year adversely impacted our plan to market and sell the photonics and photoflash businesses 
we initiated necessary actions during fiscal year to respond to these changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that we could not effectively market and sell the photonics business given the changed circumstances and  after careful consideration  we decided to cease our plan to actively market and sell the photonics business 
the photonics business is no longer reflected as discontinued operations 
however  we remain committed to a plan to actively market and sell the photoflash business 
this business continues to be reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
in addition  during december  our management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our human health segment cellular screening fluorescence and luminescence workstations  analytical proteomics instruments and proteomics and genomics instruments 
the shut down of the cellular screening fluorescence and luminescence workstations business  the analytical proteomics instruments business  and the proteomics and genomics instruments business resulted in a pre tax gain of million and a pre tax loss of million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value during fiscal years and  respectively 
in november  we acquired viacell  which specializes in the collection  testing  processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells 
following the viacell acquisition  our board approved a plan to sell the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses that were acquired with viacell 
we determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by our human health segment 
we also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses  we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products 
after careful consideration  we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year to shut down the viacyte sm and cellular therapy technology businesses 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million for severance and facility closure costs during fiscal year and recorded an additional pre tax loss of million related to facility closure costs during fiscal year during fiscal years  and  we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year  a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year and a pre tax loss of million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we reached a settlement with the landlord of a closed facility and recognized a pre tax loss of million 
during fiscal year  we substantially completed the remediation of an environmental matter within the lithography business and recognized a pre tax loss of million 
the benefit from income taxes of million recorded in discontinued operations in fiscal year includes million of income tax benefits related to the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during the third quarter of fiscal year as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

we anticipate that the transfer of the interest will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year we expect to pay approximately million in cash for this acquisition  and to record a gain on our previously held interest 
we expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 
purchase of intangible assets from ge healthcare 
in september  we purchased the core technology and patents of ge healthcare s h and c catalog radiochemicals  scintillation proximity assay spa reagents and cytostar t plate portfolios for aggregate consideration of million in cash 
the catalog radiochemical products are used for a variety of research applications  including screening of potential drug candidates through binding assays 
the spa bead based light emitting assay and cytostar t plate technologies are offerings that enable the automation of high throughput screening hts processes to help drug discovery researchers determine if potential new drug compounds are effective against their intended disease targets 
we expect that incorporation of these technologies will strengthen our g protein coupled receptor and kinase research product lines and complement our hts and research reagent solutions 
the core technology and patents that we purchased do not meet the definition of a business  as the purchased assets were not accompanied by any associated processes 
purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we report the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of our human health segment from the purchase date 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review on a periodic basis for long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished

we expect this acquisition to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions 
we initially paid pediatrix medical group  inc approximately million in cash for this transaction 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we received approximately million from pediatrix medical group  inc for net working capital adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we paid approximately million to pediatrix medical group  inc as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill  all of which is tax deductible 
we report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our human health segment from the acquisition date 
the fiscal year acquisitions of sym bio  analytica and opto technology were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
allocations of the purchase price for these acquisitions were based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired  and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
the fair values assigned to contingent consideration  tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
contingent consideration has been measured at fair value at the acquisition date with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings 
the acquisitions completed prior to fiscal year were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired  and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
the excess purchase price over those assigned values was recorded as goodwill 

table of contents as of january   the purchase price and related allocations for the sym bio acquisition was preliminary 
the preliminary allocation may be revised as a result of additional information regarding taxes 
for acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year  during the measurement period  we will recognize additional assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements 
the effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date 
the effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation  amortization  or other income or expense recognized in prior periods 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
contingencies  including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of january   which represents our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the time period over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a prp  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred  the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded

 against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief 
in  the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants 
we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo s patents are invalid 
in july  the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and  we believe  excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo s patents 
summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january  and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july in january  the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march  the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs 
applera corp 
and tropix  inc  which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo s case against us

 relating to certain aspects of the collection  cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood pharmastem i 
after several years of proceedings at the district court level  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision in july that viacell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid 
pharmastem filed a certiorari petition in january seeking to have the united states supreme court review the appellate court s decision as to the invalidity of the patents  but did not seek any further review of the non infringement decision 
however  the united states supreme court denied certiorari in march  so the decision by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in favor of viacell is final and non appealable 
pharmastem had also filed a second complaint against viacell and other defendants in july in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  alleging infringement of united states patents no 
 and  which also relate to certain aspects of the collection  cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood pharmastem ii 
the delaware court granted viacell s motion in october to stay the proceedings in pharmastem ii pending the outcome of pharmastem i and a decision from the united states patent and trademark office us pto on certain patent re examination issues 
on september   the us pto issued a re examination certificate cancelling all claims of united states patent no 
 and on september   the us pto issued a re examination certificate cancelling all claims of united states patent no 
 as a result of the cancellation of all patent claims involved in pharmastem ii by the us pto  we sought and in december the court entered a stipulation of dismissal  dismissing all claims between the parties with prejudice 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings  and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters 
while each of these matters is subject to uncertainty  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we re measured several of our uncertain tax positions related to fiscal years through during fiscal year based on new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years 
we also effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide 
the re measurements and closure of audits included positions in hong kong  the united kingdom  australia and the united states 
during fiscal year  we effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide  including in canada  the netherlands  the united kingdom and the united states covering various years ranging from through during fiscal year  the us internal revenue service concluded its audit of our federal income taxes for fiscal years through there was a single open issue related to this audit which we favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year tax years ranging from through remain open to examination by various state and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  such as singapore  canada  germany  italy  the united kingdom and the united states 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in

capital expenditures during fiscal year  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year  primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  and to develop information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 
other potential liquidity considerations at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and an amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility with million available for additional borrowing

distressed global financial markets have adversely impacted general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability  creating increased volatility in security prices  widening credit spreads  and decreasing valuations of certain investments 
the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold 
increases in credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable  could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
we cannot predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected 
in difficult global financial markets  we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost  or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 
our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets  however  as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets  our pension funds had a negative return for fiscal year  offset by modest gains for fiscal year  which in turn created increased pension costs in fiscal year and potentially in additional future periods for all pension plans 
we may be required to fund our pension plans outside the united states with a contribution of up to million by the end of fiscal year  and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in 
table of contents future periods for all pension plans 
additionally  we expect to contribute up to million to the pension plan in the united states during fiscal year for the plan year in connection with the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  as described above 
effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements significant aspects of a business combination 
under this guidance  acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date  ipr d is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed rather than capitalized  contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date  with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense 
this guidance amends the accounting for income taxes such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of this guidance would also apply the provisions of this guidance 
this guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
we adopted this authoritative guidance on business combinations in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our acquisition activity in fiscal year see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on noncontrolling interests

this guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the objective of this guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash 
table of contents flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under the new authoritative guidance on business combinations  and other accounting principles 
this guidance applies to all intangible assets  whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise 
we adopted this authoritative guidance on determination of the useful life of intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  which requires additional disclosures for employers pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of the guidance on fair value measurements 
this guidance requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under the fair value measurement guidance  including the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets  and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
we adopted this authoritative guidance about postretirement benefit plan assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and have evaluated the requirements  which provide for additional disclosure on our postretirement benefit plan assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for our disclosure on postretirement benefit plan assets 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  which amends and clarifies the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and related disclosures of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this guidance is effective for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december  we adopted this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year in conjunction with the adoption of the new authoritative guidance on business combinations 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our acquisition activity in fiscal year see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
prior to this guidance  fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed annually 
this guidance requires all entities to disclose the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and is effective for interim periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  in periods after initial adoption  this guidance requires comparative disclosures only for periods ending after initial adoption 
we adopted this authoritative guidance in the second quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on subsequent events  which establishes general standards for the accounting and disclosure of events or transactions that occur during the period after the balance sheet date that management will need to evaluate for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
we adopted this authoritative guidance on subsequent events in the second quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification and the hierarchy of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the codification will now be the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority

as of the effective date  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other nongrandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification will become nonauthoritative 
we adopted this authoritative guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this guidance is intended to improve practices that have developed that are not consistent with the original intent and key requirements of the original disclosure requirements  including establishing a new participating interest definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting  clarifying and amending the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale  and changing the amount that can be recognized as a gain or loss on a transfer accounted for as a sale when beneficial interests are received by the transferor 
this guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to provide information about transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets in the first quarter of fiscal year we expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this guidance requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity based on whether the entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
also  this guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary  and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity 
enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities in the first quarter of fiscal year we expect the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue generating activities 
this guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating and measuring deliverables and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in this guidance also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms of significant deliverables  and a vendor s performance within those arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality of the product and excludes these products from current software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality 
once adopted the amendments will subject software enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements  such as guidance 
table of contents surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period  or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
warranty costs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale 
warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand  or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements  or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 

table of contents business combinations 
business combinations are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  ipr d is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair value for assets and liabilities acquired 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process 
the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january or the first day of each fiscal year 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered 
non amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
through fiscal year  we assessed the annual impairment testing using the analytical sciences and laboratory services  illumination and detection solutions  genetic screening  bio discovery and medical imaging reporting units 
we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january  and december   and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business  and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future  and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement plans 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the 
table of contents recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of january   we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was and was for all plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by million for fiscal year in the united states and by million for fiscal year for all plans outside the united states 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by million for fiscal year in the united states and by million for fiscal year for all plans outside the united states 
we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled restructuring and lease charges reversals  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets  and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the fiscal year ended january   we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets 
we recorded million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings  and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions  and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and 
table of contents deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  other income tax credits and certain pension accruals 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january  we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only  and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments 
by nature  all financial instruments involve market and credit risks 
we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing  investing and operating the business 
the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies  with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 
we did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal year 
table of contents principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp  canadian dollar cad  euro eur  japanese yen jpy  and singapore dollar sgd 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at january  and million at december   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material 
the duration of these contracts was generally days during fiscal years  and we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october  with notional amounts totaling million and a weighted average interest rate of  that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our senior unsecured notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance  with a notional amount totaling million  was no longer probable 
as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable  we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and recognized a loss of million  in interest and other expense  net 
as of january   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
we amortized into interest expense million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year for these derivative losses 
market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
moreover  we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states  material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states  resulting in a natural hedge 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of january   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year  the value at risk ranged between million and million  with an average of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and 
table of contents our earnings 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 
we entered into forward interest rate contracts in october  with notional amounts totaling million and a weighted average interest rate of  that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our senior unsecured notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive loss income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance  with a notional amount totaling million  was no longer probable 
as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable  we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and recognized a loss of million  in interest and other expense  net 
as of january   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
we amortized into interest expense million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year for these derivative losses 
interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of january   our debt portfolio consisted of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at january  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate
