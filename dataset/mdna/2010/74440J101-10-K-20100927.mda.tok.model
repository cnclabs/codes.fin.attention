table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop tiny  sustained release  drug delivery products that are administered by implantation  injection or insertion 
once administered  a drug is released on a controlled and level basis for months or years 
we have two core technology systems  durasert and biosilicon 
utilizing three generations of our durasert technology system  we have one product candidate for chronic eye disease that has been given priority review by the fda and two of the only three products approved by the fda for the long term  sustained release delivery of drug to treat chronic eye disease 
we have a collaboration agreement with pfizer  our largest shareholder  to develop additional ophthalmic products 
iluvien  the product candidate with priority review  is designed to provide sustained release treatment for dme 
dme is a leading cause of vision loss for people under the age of and has been estimated to affect over  people in the united states 
using the third generation of our durasert technology system  iluvien is injected into the eye and delivers the corticosteroid fa over a period of up to years 
iluvien is licensed to alimera  which is completing fully recruited phase iii clinical trials 
based on month data released in december  alimera filed an nda with the fda in june and registration filings in various european countries in july on august   the fda granted priority review status and  as a result  alimera could receive a response to its nda from the fda by the end of calendar year if approved  alimera has indicated that it expects to commercialize iluvien as early as the first calendar quarter of under our collaboration agreement with alimera  iluvien is also being studied in investigator sponsored pilot clinical trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of iluvien in both wet and dry amd and rvo 
our two fda approved sustained release products utilize earlier generations of our durasert technology system  second generation retisert for the treatment of posterior uveitis and our first generation vitrasert for the treatment of aids related cmv retinitis 
we have licensed both of these products and the technologies underlying them to bausch lomb 
under our worldwide collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer  we are working together on a joint research program aimed at developing ophthalmic products using our sustained release drug delivery technologies not licensed to others 
retisert provides sustained release treatment for approximately two and a half years  and vitrasert provides sustained release treatment for six to nine months 
biosilicon  our other principal technology system  is a fully erodible  nanostructured  porous silicon designed to provide sustained delivery of various therapeutics  including small drug molecules  proteins and peptides 
based on results of our preliminary studies  we are currently targeting biosilicon as a key second prong of our drug delivery technology platform 
effective june   we reincorporated from western australia to the united states the reincorporation 

table of contents equity financing in july  we sold  units at a price of per unit for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consisted of i one share of common stock  and ii one warrant to purchase share of common stock at per share 
in addition  we simultaneously completed a sale of  units for gross proceeds of approximately million 
license and collaboration agreements alimera upon execution of the alimera agreement in march  we received consideration of million in cash and alimera cancelled million of accrued development cost liabilities  including related penalties and accrued interest  owed by us to alimera as of march  in addition  we received a million conditional note providing for aggregate principal and interest payments of up to approximately million through september  alimera agreed to pay us a million milestone payment upon fda approval of iluvien for dme and alimera assumed all financial responsibility for the development of licensed products under the alimera agreement  which had previously been shared equally  including reimbursement of approved development costs incurred by us in support of the ongoing clinical studies of iluvien and anticipated regulatory submissions 
in exchange  we decreased our share in any future profits  as defined  on sales of iluvien by alimera from to  subject to an offset of of pre profitability commercialization costs  as defined  incurred by alimera 
in the event alimera sublicenses commercialization  we are entitled to receive of royalties and of non royalty consideration received by alimera  less certain permitted deductions 
alimera has indicated that it intends to commercialize iluvien  if approved  through a direct sales force in the united states and to seek marketing collaboration partners for the commercialization of iluvien outside of the united states 
the scheduled payment terms on the million conditional note consisted of i interest only at an annual rate of payable quarterly through march and ii principal payments of  per month commencing april  together with interest payable quarterly at an annual rate of 
upon the occurrence of certain defined liquidity events such as an initial public offering of alimera  other sales of capital stock of alimera and or the sale or other disposition of substantially all of alimera s assets that resulted in aggregate cash and or noncash proceeds to alimera in excess of million  the note became immediately due and payable 
failure by alimera to repay the note upon the occurrence of a defined liquidity event constituted an event of default under the note 
if no liquidity event occurred on or before september   the note would automatically be cancelled 
based upon the terms of the note  payment was within the control of alimera unless there was a liquidity event or an event of default 
pursuant to the alimera agreement  a total of million of deferred revenue was recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the month performance obligation period from the amendment effective date through december  following consummation of the alimera agreement  we received conditional note interest payments and reimbursements of approved development costs totaling approximately million  million and  during the years ended june   and  respectively 
in addition  on april   following consummation of its initial public offering  alimera paid the million conditional note in full 
cash consideration received from alimera during the performance period was recognized as revenue ratably over the performance period  including immediate revenue recognition catch up for the pro rata period from the amendment effective date to the date of each receipt 
cash consideration received subsequent to december  is being recognized as revenue upon receipt or at such earlier date  if applicable  on which any such amount is both fixed and determinable and reasonably assured of collection 
pfizer under our worldwide collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer  beginning in calendar year and continuing until commencement of the first phase iii clinical trial  pfizer has agreed to provide us 
table of contents with a minimum of  per quarter in research funding 
to date  the joint research program has consisted of pre clinical studies 
under the agreement  we are also entitled to receive clinical development milestone payments and  following commercialization of any products  sales based milestones and royalties 
because we have been unable to define the period of our performance obligations under this agreement  none of the cash payments received from pfizer to date has been recognized as revenue 
at june   approximately million was recorded as non current deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
bausch lomb bausch lomb sells vitrasert and retisert 
our collaboration agreement with bausch lomb provides for royalties on such sales 
in june we received a million advance from bausch lomb in consideration of million of future retisert royalties that otherwise would be payable to us 
bausch lomb retained million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal of retisert royalties that otherwise would have been payable to us 
during the quarter ended june   bausch lomb retained the final portion of these royalties otherwise payable and we recorded an incremental  of royalty income  which was paid by bausch lomb 
subsequent to june   we are entitled to receive of the retisert royalties pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
vitrasert royalties were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal intrinsiq in connection with a january exclusive field of use license with intrinsiq for nutraceutical and food science applications of biosilicon  we received license fee payments of  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal  we received the first contractual minimum royalty payment of  subject to continuation of the license agreement  which is cancellable by intrinsiq on days notice  we are entitled to receive additional scheduled minimum royalty payments totaling approximately million through april  creditable against quarterly royalties earned  if any 
the next scheduled minimum royalty payment of  is due in january summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience  anticipated results and trends and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
by their nature  these estimates  judgments and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe that a few of these accounting policies and related estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are most critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance because these specific areas require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time  and different estimates which also could have been reasonable might have produced different financial results 
it is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies discussed below 
revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements for the development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing our durasert and biosilicon technology 
table of contents systems 
the terms of these arrangements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  granting of license rights  providing research and development services and manufacturing of clinical materials  participating on joint research committee in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
license fees and multiple element arrangements 
we recognize non refundable license fees as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
we analyze multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if we determine the license either i does not have stand alone value or ii has stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must assess the period over which our performance obligations will be completed 
we then recognize collaborative research and development revenue on a straight line basis over the expected performance period using the cumulative catch up method 
under this method  the portion of any such payment except payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones represented by the time elapsed from the commencement of the performance period to the payment date as a percentage of the total performance period is recognized immediately as revenue  with the remainder amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
we limit the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under an arrangement to the cumulative amount of payments received as of the period ending date 
all payments received following the end of the performance period are recognized as revenue when earned 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligations either cease or become inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligations become inconsequential and perfunctory 
we then recognize revenue over the remaining estimated period of performance 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a research or steering committee as part of an arrangement accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether the nature of our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
if such services are determined to be other than inconsequential  performance obligations are combined with other performance obligations in determining the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
reimbursement of costs 
our business includes providing research and development services on behalf of our collaboration partners to assist in advancing the developmental cycle of the licensed products 
we act primarily as a principal in these transactions  and amounts received are classified as a component of revenue to be recognized consistent with the revenue recognition policy summarized above 
we record the expenses incurred and reimbursed on a gross basis 
royalty income 
royalty income is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the applicable arrangement 
if royalties are received while we have remaining performance obligations  such amounts are attributed to the services being performed under the arrangement and are recognized as collaborative research and development revenue over the expected performance period using the cumulative catch up method 

table of contents deferred revenue 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue amounts not expected to be recognized within one year following the balance sheet date are classified as non current liabilities 
applying the policies described above  we reported collaborative research and development revenues of million for the year ended june  fiscal  million for the year ended june  fiscal and million for the year ended june  fiscal 
substantially all of these revenues were attributable to our march amended and restated collaboration agreement with alimera 
with respect to our alimera collaboration agreement  management determined that our performance obligations ended as of december  amounts received after that date are immediately recognized as revenue and for fiscal included payment in full by alimera of a million conditional note in april in connection with our license and collaboration agreement with pfizer  we have been unable to estimate the period of our performance obligations 
accordingly  we recorded an aggregate of approximately million of payments received through june  as non current deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
the current portion of deferred revenue and the remainder of the non current deferred revenue at june  is attributable to our intrinsiq license  which includes license and minimum royalty payments that are being amortized over the life of the associated patents through valuation of intangible assets our intangible assets include the durasert and biosilicon technology systems 
we review these intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life of the asset is no longer appropriate 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant change relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant industry or economic trends and developments 
if an impairment trigger is identified  we determine impairment by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  and the carrying value is adjusted 
the estimated future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows related to existing contractual agreements as well as projected cash flows from potential future research and development collaboration agreements utilizing the underlying technology system 
future adverse changes or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge with respect to some or all of the million of intangible assets that appear on our consolidated balance sheet as of june  such an impairment charge could materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified

for fiscal  the alimera related revenues included payment in full by alimera of the million conditional note plus interest 
we are entitled to receive a million milestone payment from alimera within days following an fda approval of iluvien 
however  absent an fda approval of iluvien during fiscal  we currently expect to record an insignificant amount of collaborative research and development revenue attributable to the alimera collaboration agreement in fiscal pursuant to a june side letter to the collaboration agreement with bausch lomb  cds received million from bausch lomb as an advance payment in consideration of million of future retisert royalties that otherwise would have been payable to us 
during fiscal  million of retisert royalties otherwise payable was retained by bausch lomb  thereby completing the advance royalty agreement  and  was recorded as royalty income  which amount was received from bausch lomb in august the fiscal total of royalties payable and otherwise payable of approximately million compared to approximately million of royalties otherwise payable for fiscal  a decrease of 
for the year ending june  fiscal  we will record royalty income equal to of the retisert royalties reported by bausch lomb 
research and development research and development decreased by approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to an approximate million 
table of contents reduction of uk based research and development costs  primarily related to third party costs of our brachysil clinical program and third party biosilicon manufacturing development for the period prior to consummation of our intrinsiq supply agreement 
approximately  of the total decrease was attributable to the relative strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling 
general and administrative general and administrative costs decreased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal this net decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors the absence of a million provision for losses in fiscal on a note receivable  the elimination of approximately  of legal fees and consulting services incurred in fiscal directly related to the june reincorporation  an approximate  reduction in us salaries and benefits  primarily related to fiscal salary and severance agreement costs of a former executive officer  partially offset by an approximate  increase in stock based compensation 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives represented an expense of  for fiscal compared to income of  for fiscal detachable warrants issued in share offerings denominated in a were recorded as derivative liabilities  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
the change in fair value of derivatives  determined using the black scholes valuation model  primarily reflected a net increase in the market price of our shares in fiscal resulting in a smaller spread between the market price and the us equivalent exercise prices of the warrants compared to a net decrease in the market price of our shares in fiscal the change in fair value was also impacted by the year weighted average remaining life of the underlying warrants at june  we are required to re value these warrants at each subsequent balance sheet date  and changes in their fair values will result in adjustments to our recorded derivative liabilities approximately million at june  and a corresponding income or expense in our statement of operations 
fluctuations in the fair values of these warrants could have a substantial impact on our future quarterly and annual operating results until the last to expire of these warrants in july interest income interest income decreased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  primarily due to sharply lower weighted average interest rates earned on money market funds 
other expense income other expense  net of  for fiscal compares to other income of  for fiscal this change was primarily attributable to the absence in fiscal of foreign exchange gains of  recognized in fiscal resulting from the reclassification into earnings of foreign currency translation reserve balances in connection with the dissolution of subsidiaries

impairment of goodwill in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million equal to the total carrying value of goodwill 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
research and development research and development decreased by approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors the absence in fiscal of million of iluvien co development costs incurred in fiscal as a result of the assumption by alimera of all financial responsibility for the development of licensed products pursuant to the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with alimera  and a decrease in fiscal of approximately million in uk based research and development costs  of which approximately million was attributable to the relative strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling and approximately  was primarily attributable to reduced levels of personnel  legal  facilities and depreciation expenses

recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted the provisions of asc  collaborative arrangements  formerly emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements 
this standard defines a collaborative arrangement as a contractual arrangement in which the parties are i active participants to the arrangement  and ii exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend upon the commercial success of the endeavor 
it also addresses the appropriate statements of operations presentation for activities and payments between the participants in a collaborative arrangement as well as for costs incurred and revenue generated from transactions with third parties 
adoption of this standard did not have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
asu updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the update provides principles for allocation of consideration among multiple elements of revenue arrangements  allowing more flexibility in identifying and accounting for separate deliverables under an arrangement 
asu introduces an estimated selling price method for valuing the elements of a bundled arrangement if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available 
in addition  the update also significantly expands related disclosure requirements 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are evaluating the potential application of this new accounting update to new or materially modified revenue arrangements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic milestone method of revenue recognition a consensus of the fasb eitf asu 
asu amends asc and established a revenue recognition method for contingent consideration that is payable on achievement of an uncertain future event  referred to as a milestone 
the scope of the milestone method is limited to research and development agreements and is applicable to milestones in multiple deliverable arrangements involving research and development transactions 
the guidance does not preclude the application of any other applicable revenue guidance 
the guidance will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of asu on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal to  we financed our operations primarily from license fees  research and development funding and contingent cash payments from our collaboration partners and  to a lesser degree  from the july private placement of our equity securities 
at june   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  
table of contents cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
our cash equivalents are invested in institutional money market funds and our marketable securities are invested in investment grade corporate debt  government agency securities and commercial paper with maturities at june  ranging from to months 
with the exception of fiscal  we have incurred operating losses since inception  and  at june   we had a total accumulated deficit of million 
we generally expect negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis at least until such time as one or more of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval and achieves sufficient sales 
we believe we can fund our operations as currently conducted into at least calendar year whether we will require  or desire  to raise additional capital will be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to the continuation of our existing collaborations with pfizer and alimera  including their continued funding of our programs and our receipt of milestone  royalty and other payments  the timing of fda regulatory approval and commercialization of iluvien  the amount of quarterly royalty payments from sales of retisert  which payments resumed in august following completion of an advance royalty agreement  the scope and extent of our internally funded existing operations and programs  any new product candidates and any new business opportunities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements for product candidates for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the success of our products and product candidates  including the timing and costs of regulatory approvals and the commercial success of approved products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and changes in our operating plan  including the pursuit of new business opportunities  which may affect our need for capital 
absent adequate levels of funding from new and existing collaboration agreements and or financing transactions  management currently believes that our cash position thereafter will be substantially dependent upon the timing of fda approval and the initiation and success of commercialization of iluvien  and the resulting occurrence of certain milestone events under the terms of our collaboration agreement with alimera 
alimera has agreed to pay us million upon fda approval of iluvien for dme and a profit share on its sales of iluvien  subject to offset of of defined pre profitability commercialization costs incurred by alimera 
in the event alimera sublicenses commercialization  we would receive of royalties and of non royalty consideration received by alimera  less certain permitted deductions 
there is no assurance that the fda will approve iluvien  or that iluvien will achieve market acceptance even if it is approved by the fda 
the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets have made it significantly more difficult and more expensive to obtain financing 
if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital in the future  we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity  and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms  including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if adequate financing is not available if and when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  postpone the pursuit of product candidates and new business opportunities  or otherwise reduce our cash requirements

the downward historical trend of all other cash outflows  net was attributable to several factors  primarily including the completion of phase ii clinical studies for an internally financed product candidate and the elimination of personnel  occupancy and related overhead costs attributable to the closing of the perth  australia office in connection with the reincorporation

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for pre clinical costs  supplies and other operating needs 
we also have contractual obligations that are variable in nature and  as such  are not included in the above table 
these include the following executive contracts 
at june   we had agreements with two executive officers that would require us to make severance payments to them if we terminate their employment without cause or the executives resign for good cause 
such severance agreements would require us to make aggregate payments of up to approximately  the amounts payable pursuant to severance arrangements change over time depending upon the date of termination and then current salaries 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to changes in the valuation of derivative liabilities  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative liabilities at june   the balance of our derivative liabilities  which relate to warrants denominated in a  totaled approximately million and was determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the change in fair value of derivatives resulted in an expense of  for fiscal and income of  for fiscal and million for fiscal our financial position and results of operations will continue to be sensitive to future revaluations of these derivative liabilities 
at june   these warrants had a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately months and a weighted average exercise price of per share compared to the nasdaq closing price of our common shares 
the primary factor that impacts the change in fair value of these derivatives is fluctuations in our share price 
reduction of the remaining useful life of the warrants  assuming that share price remains constant  would result in a significant decrease of the derivative liability value during fiscal based on the short remaining life of the underlying warrants
