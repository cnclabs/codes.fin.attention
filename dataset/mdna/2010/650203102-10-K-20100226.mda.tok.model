significant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the factors considered by management include  but are not limited to adverse changes in management s assessment of the factors used to determine that a security was not other than temporarily impaired could lead to additional impairment charges 
conditions affecting a security that we determined to be temporary could become other than temporary and warrant an impairment charge 
additionally  a security that had no apparent risk could be affected by a sudden or acute market condition and necessitate an impairment charge 
the company has seven securities that are currently valued at or more below book value that are not considered other than temporarily impaired 
at december   these securities have a fair value of million compared to a book value of million 
percentage and length of time by which an issue is below book value  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer including their ability to meet contractual obligations in a timely manner  ratings of the security  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions  whether the decline is due to interest rates and spreads or credit risk  the value of underlying collateral  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in market value or more likely than not will be required to sell a debt security before its anticipated recovery which may be until maturity 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we evaluate goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm  as appropriate 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using an independent valuation firm  and determined there was no impairment 
through year end  no events or circumstances subsequent to the annual testing date indicate that the carrying value of the company s goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at december   was million and million  respectively 
for further discussion on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  see the goodwill and intangible assets section on page of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including estimated future cash flows  comparable transactions  control premium and market peers 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
accounting standards require testing for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in the third quarter  given the economic climate and the company s market capitalization relative to book value  the company s management performed a review to determine if there were any triggering events which would require the company to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
this review included but was not limited to potential triggering events such as the following events and circumstances if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
management has evaluated the effect of lowering the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and determined that fair value would have to decline more than before step of the impairment analysis would be required under accounting guidance for goodwill impairment 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  impairment of other assets or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  cash flow or operating losses at the reporting unit level  negative current events or long term outlooks for specific industries  not meeting analyst expectations or internal forecasts in consecutive periods or downward adjustments to further forecasts  planned or announced layoffs or asset dispositions  market capitalization of the company below its book value 
upon consideration of the guidance on goodwill impairment and the company s financial position  the company concluded that the fact that its market capitalization was below its book value at september  was outweighed by the lack of other triggering events and no other events or circumstances occurred that would trigger the requirement to perform an interim test for goodwill impairment 
allowance for loan losses critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions it is the policy of newalliance to maintain an allowance for loan losses that equals management s best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management follows a guiding principle that the level of the reserve should be directionally consistent with asset quality indicators 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined based upon a detailed evaluation of the portfolio and sub portfolios through a process which considers numerous factors  including levels and direction of delinquencies  historical loss rates over the business cycle  non performing loans and assets  risk ratings  estimated credit losses using both internal and external portfolio reviews  current economic and market conditions  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in underwriting and experience of staff 
the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
for further discussion on the allowance for loan losses  see the allowance for loan losses section on page of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by analyzing and estimating losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to use historical information as well as current economic data to make judgments on the adequacy of the allowance 
as the allowance is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  it may impact the portfolio in a way currently unforeseen 
adverse changes in management s assessment of the factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses could lead to additional provisions 
actual loan losses could differ materially from management s estimates if actual losses and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized 
these factors and conditions include general economic conditions within newalliance s market  trends within industries  real estate and other collateral values  interest rates and the financial condition of the individual borrower 
while management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for losses  thereby negatively affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s asset and liabilities 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carryback refund claims could be made 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate related to the valuation allowance  including our assumptions about future profitability 
at december  and december   our valuation allowance was million and million  respectively  of which million for both years was established against the net state deferred tax asset as a result of the implementation of a connecticut passive investment company and is not a result of assumptions about future profitability 
because of a review of the factors discussed above related to the adequacy of the valuation allowance  our income tax expense for the year ended december  included an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to capital losses of  the increase was mainly due to additional capital losses incurred in for further discussion on our deferred taxes and valuation allowance  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
some judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in determining the valuation allowance  we use historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  the actual realization of net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our income taxes 
tax contingencies critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we regularly face challenges from domestic tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
for further discussion on current tax examinations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law  entry into new tax jurisdictions  the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 
we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcomes of known contingencies 
although we think that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may differ  which could be material to our financial statements 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate 
pension and other post retirement benefits critical estimates judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
management uses key assumptions that include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  benefits earned  interest costs  mortality rates  increases in compensation  and other factors 
the two most critical assumptions estimated return on plan assets and the discount rate are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurements 
these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually on a plan basis 
other assumptions are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors  and in accordance with us gaap the impact of these differences is accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate assumptions used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to published high quality bond indices  as well as certain yield curves 
the company used the citigroup pension liability index as a benchmark 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocations  as well as the long term historical risks and returns with each asset class within the plan portfolio 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets increases pension costs 
for further discussion on pension and other post retirement benefits  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
to reflect market interest rate conditions in calculating the projected benefit obligation  the pension discount rate was decreased from at december  to at december   and the postretirement discount rate decreased from to at each of these periods 
an expected rate of return on plan assets of was utilized at december  and while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect future pension or other postretirement obligations and expense 
continued volatility in pension expense is expected as assumed investment returns vary from actual 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by  while a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by  a basis point decrease or increase in the expected return on assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense  respectively  by recent accounting changes we have adopted the following new accounting pronouncements and authoritative guidance during except as indicated  the adoption of the following pronouncements did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

contents in each of these accounting topics are further organized by subtopic  section and paragraph 
changes to the codification are in the form of accounting standards updates issued by the fasb 
an accounting standards update is not authoritative  rather  it is a document that communicates the specific amendments that change the codification and provides background information about the guidance  including the basis for conclusions on changes made to the codification 
the adoption of sfas no 
and the codification did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements but changed the referencing system for accounting standards from the legacy gaap citations to codification topic numbers

operating results table summary income statements year ended december  change dollars in thousands  except per share data amount percent amount percent net interest income     provision for loan losses     non interest income     operating expenses     merger related charges  income before income taxes     income tax expense     net income     basic and diluted earnings per share earnings summary comparison of and the year was one of continued stress on the banking system  where raising capital and controlling credit costs were top priorities for the industry 
assisted by numerous government programs  the longest and deepest economic downturn since the s appears to have abated 
however  continued credit market tightness  damage to household balance sheets and lack of job security are tempering the economic recovery 
newalliance leveraged its position of financial and credit strength and proceeded aggressively to take deposit market share  build revenue momentum and take advantage of disruption in the marketplace 
as shown in table  earnings per share for the year ended december  increased over the same period in primarily due to a substantial reduction in our cost of funds while gaining deposit market share  predominantly core deposits  gains on sales of mortgage backed securities and residential mortgages 
these were the main drivers behind the increases in net interest income before provision and non interest income of million and million  respectively 
additionally  these increases more than offset the million increase in the provision for loan losses due to the economic environment and loan net charge offs  the increase in operating expenses of million  largely due to the fdic special assessment of million and a million increase in income tax expense due to higher net income along with an increase in the effective tax rate 
comparison of and in a year that had unprecedented turmoil in the economy and financial markets  newalliance improved the core performance of the company  was able to mitigate the steep declines in market interest rates with new growth and avoided vast losses in its loan and investment securities portfolios due to historically sound credit practices 
as shown in table  net income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  the largest single component for this year over year increase resulted from the securities restructuring in for which a net loss of million million  net of tax was recorded 
during the year ended december   newalliance sold approximately million of available for sale securities and realized net losses totaling million 
the sale was undertaken to reduce the company s exposure to fixed rate assets as well as to increase the yield on the portfolio  thereby providing a prospective improvement in the net interest margin 
newalliance replaced substantially all of the assets sold with higher yielding agency hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
excluding the restructuring charge  net income increased million from the prior year period 
the primary driver of this year over year increase was the increase in net interest income of million largely due to the reduction of deposit costs and organic growth in the loan portfolio  partially offset by declines in average loan yields and increased borrowings 
mostly offsetting the increase in net interest income was an increase in the provision for loan losses of million due to the increase in nonperforming loans and to reflect the rising risk inherent in the loan portfolio owing to the current economic environment  an increase in operating interest expenses of million largely due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense including payment of an executive severance and higher bonus accruals as well as increased outside services expense for consulting 
income tax expense also increased  primarily attributable to higher pre tax income 
average balances  interest and average yields cost table below sets forth certain information concerning average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their associated yields or rates for the periods indicated 
the average yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expenses by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown and reflect annualized yields and costs 
average balances are computed using daily balances 
yields and amounts earned include loan fees and fair value adjustments related to acquired loans 
loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans have been included in interest earning assets for purposes of these computations 
interest on nonaccrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income

net interest margin is the difference between the income on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
during  the frb left the overnight lending target rate unchanged at a range between and 
for the twelve months ended december   the frb lowered the target federal funds rate seven times  for a total decrease of basis points from to between and 
decreases of basis points and basis points occurred during the first and second quarters of  respectively  while the frb left the overnight federal funds target rate unchanged at for the quarter ending september  during the fourth quarter of the frb reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points 
comparison of and as shown in table  net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from december  the increase was due to a the average balances of interest earning assets outpacing the growth in interest bearing liabilities by approximately million  b the repricing or maturing of interest bearing liabilities outpacing that of interest earning assets  thereby allowing us to reduce our cost of funds at a faster pace and c the shift in the mix of interest bearing liabilities from higher cost time deposits and borrowings to core deposits which reduced the cost of funds by basis points 
the net interest margin increased seven basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was a net result of the loss of the fhlb boston dividend and a reduction in interest earning asset yields that were more than offset by the reduction in the costs of interest bearing liabilities 
as a voluntary member of the fhlb  the company is required to invest in stock of the fhlb in an amount based partly upon its outstanding advances from the fhlb 
stock is purchased at par value 
upon redemption of the stock  which is at the discretion of the fhlb  the company would receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock 
at its discretion  the fhlb may also declare dividends on its stock 
no dividends have been received for the year ended december  compared to dividends of million for the year ended december  on february   the fhlb boston advised its members that  while it currently meets all its regulatory capital requirements  it is focusing on preserving capital in response to ongoing market volatility  and accordingly  has suspended its quarterly dividend and extended the moratorium on excess stock purchases  primarily due to other than temporary impairment charges on its private label mortgage backed securities investments 
the fhlb boston has stated that it expects and intends to hold its private label mortgagebacked securities to maturity 
in a letter to member banks on october   the fhlb boston announced the filing of its quarterly report to the sec and disclosed that the credit quality of the loans underlying the bank s portfolio of private label mortgage backed securities remains vulnerable to the housing and capital markets  which could result in additional losses 
accordingly  to protect its capital base and build retained earnings  the moratorium on excess stock repurchases and the quarterly dividend payout suspension continue 
also  the fhlb boston has implemented a revised operating plan that includes certain revenue enhancement and expense reduction initiatives and the goal of the plan is to build retained earnings to an appropriate level so that they may eventually resume paying dividends and end the moratorium on excess stock repurchases 
the company does not anticipate a reinstatement of the fhlb boston dividend in based on these facts  the company evaluated its fhlb boston capital stock for potential impairment at december  capital adequacy  credit ratings  the value of the stock  overall financial condition of both the federal home loan bank system fhlb and fhlb boston as well as current economic factors were analyzed in the impairment analysis 
fhlb boston is one of the twelve individual banks within the fhlb 
although the individual banks of the fhlb operate as separate entities  the obligations of the individual home loan banks are joint and several obligations of all twelve individual banks 
under this structure  there have been no defaults and no interest deferrals for any of the fhlb s consolidated operations 
as of september   the fhlb had regulatory capital of billion and all twelve individual banks were in compliance with risk based capital rules and minimum leverage ratio requirements 
fhlb boston had regulatory capital of billion  or and leverage capital of at september   which were above the minimum requirements of and  respectively 
the core operations of the fhlb and the fhlb boston of issuing debt into the capital markets and making advances to their members remains a viable and profitable business 
they continue to have ample access to liquidity through the capital markets  the investing of fed funds  term deposits and issuing member advances 
additionally  the fhlb continues to have aaa rating from both moody s and standard and poors and is not on a watchlist for downgrade 
there is no indication that the stock has traded at any price below its carrying value of per share 
the company therefore concluded that its position in federal home loan bank capital stock is not impaired 
interest and dividend income decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  comprising of a decrease of million due to rate  offset by a million increase due to volume 
the decline in rate was primarily due to a newly originated loans and adjustable or variable rate loans that were reset at reduced rates due to the rate cuts imposed by the frb throughout  b the absence of a quarterly dividend from the fhlb boston and c a decline in the average yield in the investment securities portfolio due to a decline in market interest rates resulting from the current economic conditions 
loan yields have also been negatively impacted to a lesser extent by the increase in nonperforming loans 
investment growth helped to mitigate the effect of the rate decline on interest income as the average balance increase of million accounted for approximately million of the increase to interest income 
due to the growth in core deposits the company has expanded the securities portfolio primarily with purchases of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the average balance of the loan portfolio increased million for the period  which includes an increase of million in the average balance of loans held for sale 
given the economic and market conditions that have beset the industry over the last year  there have been fewer commercial originations that meet our underwriting criteria and although residential mortgage originations have been relatively strong  approximately half were originated at fixed rates and sold in the secondary market 
the cost of funds for the year ended december  decreased million  or nearly to million  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the company s continued strategy during this period was to reduce deposit costs and focus on the growth of core interest and non interest bearing deposits 
the result has been a decrease of million in deposit interest expense due to changes in the mix of deposits with net average balance growth of million and a decrease of basis points on the average rate paid 
this decrease in deposit interest expense was primarily in time deposits  which decreased million due to the declines in the average balances and average rate paid of million and basis points  respectively 
through targeted marketing campaigns and migration from maturing time deposits as they repriced at reduced rates  the company has been able to grow core deposit average balances by a total of million 
the main driver of core deposit growth has been savings and money market accounts with an average balance increase of million million  respectively 
additionally  when combined with the decline in the average rate paid of basis points on savings and basis points on money market  interest expense decreased by million during this period for these products 
a further benefit of the core deposit growth has been a substantial reduction in and reliance on borrowings from the fhlb 
fhlb advances and other borrowing costs decreased million due to the decline in the average balance and the average rate paid on fhlb advances of million and basis points  respectively 
the company was able to replace maturing advances with new advances at substantially lower rates or payoff maturing advances 
comparison of and as shown in table  net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was due to a basis point increase in the net interest margin to at december  from for the same period a year ago  primarily due to the significant reduction in costs associated with higher priced certificate of deposit accounts  growth in the loan portfolio and the investment portfolio restructuring in  partially offset by the effect of the decline in yield on adjustable and variable rate commercial and consumer loans 
interest income decreased million from the year ended december  and was comprised of a million decrease due to rate  offset by a million increase due to volume 
the decline due to rate was primarily caused by the significant rate cuts enacted by the frb in as average yields earned on loans and short term investments decreased basis points and basis points  respectively and the resulting decline in dividend yields on equity securities  mainly fhlb boston stock 
loan yields have also been negatively impacted by an increase in nonperforming loans 
slightly offsetting these rate declines was an increase in the average yield earned on the securities portfolio as a result of the restructuring 
strong loan growth  however  made the most substantial difference in mitigating the effects of the rate cuts as average loan balances increased million  or from the prior year 
three of the four loan categories experienced increases in average balances  with the residential real estate loan portfolio as the main driver of the growth 
the increase in average balances was due to increased loan originations as the company  with ready liquidity and capital  was able to take advantage of the pricing opportunities in our lending area due to the sustained dislocations in the credit market 
we expect this trend to continue in the near term  however  as other banks regain strength after receiving infusions of capital from the eesa and begin lending again  competition will likely increase 
for the year ended december  as compared to  the company experienced a significant reduction in its cost of funds in the amount of million as a shift in the mix of interest bearing liabilities reduced the average rate paid by basis points and helped to improve the net interest spread by basis points 
the company s continuing strategy has been to reduce deposit costs while being mindful of competitor pricing and focusing on growth of core deposits 
the shift was away from higher costing time deposits as well as from money market and now deposits and into savings deposits 
the free savings product  with an attractive interest rate  has been very successful for the company 
although the average rate paid on savings deposits increased by basis points from the prior year  the average rate paid on all interest bearing deposits declined a net basis points 
for the year ended december   total average interest bearing deposits declined million  however  average interest bearing core deposits increased million at a much lower rate 
partially offsetting the million decline in deposit interest expense was an increase in expense on borrowings of million  principally due to an increase of million in the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
fhlb advances were used to fund loan growth and to counter deposit outflows that occurred primarily in the first quarter of rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change

the provision is charged against earnings in order to maintain an allowance for loan losses that reflects management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management performs a monthly review of the loan portfolio  and based on this review determines the level of the provision necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
management recorded a provision of million for the year ended december  the primary factors that influenced management s decision to record this provision were the increase in nonperforming loans of million or  continuing trends in delinquencies  net charge offs of million and the ongoing support of estimated credit losses embedded in the portfolio 
further details about nonperforming loans can be found in the asset quality and allowance for loan losses sections beginning on page future provisions may be deemed necessary if economic conditions do not improve or continue to deteriorate 
a provision of million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans

the principal categories of non interest income are shown in table comparison of and as displayed in table  non interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  from the prior year period 
the main drivers of the increase were mortgage origination activity and loan sale income and net gain on securities 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in boli  investment management  brokerage and insurance fees  trust fees and other income 
mortgage origination activity and loan sale income increased million due to a greater number of mortgage loans originated for sale and sold in the secondary market during the year and the effect of originations that were in the pipeline at december  under commitments to be sold 
the increased origination activity has been driven by the low interest rate environment and the continued dislocation in the credit markets which has reduced the number of competitors in the short term 
net gain on securities increased due to the gains recorded on the sale of mortgage backed securities 
these securities were sold at a premium and were sold in order to reduce prepayment risk  to reduce high price premium risk and to fund the pay off of maturing fhlb advances primarily earlier in the year 
the increase in the net gain on securities is also due to the prior year impairment charges related to an investment in a trust preferred equity security in a regional bank and two preferred equity securities issued by freddie mac and lehman brothers 
partially offsetting the net gain on the sale of investments was other than temporary impairments recorded against the company s investment in an adjustable rate mortgage mutual fund and a pooled trust preferred security 
trust fees declined primarily due to a decrease in the year to date average assets under management 
the assets under management declined primarily as a result of the decline in the market value of the assets  which caused the reduction in the amount of management fees earned 
assets under management have begun to rebound in the second half of the year evidenced by the recent market improvement 
investment management  brokerage and insurance fees declined due to prevailing depressed market conditions and the ongoing lack of consumer confidence in longer term investment choices 
boli income decreased due to a decline in the average yield earned as a result of current market interest rates 
other income decreased due to a net loss of  recorded on limited partnerships during due to the decline in the fair value of the underlying investments compared to a net loss of  recorded in  b a decrease of approximately  in amounts earned on the outstanding balances of bank checks processed by a third party vendor due to the decline in market interest rates and c the prior year receipt of approximately  from the partial redemption of the company s stake in visa inc  following visa s initial public offering 
comparison of and as displayed in table  non interest income increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in non interest income was primarily attributable to the investment portfolio restructuring that resulted in a net loss recorded in of million 
excluding the investment restructuring  non interest income declined million primarily due to decreases in depositor service charges  loan and servicing income  boli and other income  partially offset by increases in net gain loss on securities and investment management  brokerage and insurance fees 
depositor service charges decreased due to a decline in overdraft fees  point of sale fees and inactive and dormant account fees 
the company eliminated debit card point of sale  inactive and dormant account service charges during the first quarter of for promotional and competitive reasons  while overdraft fees declined due to volume 
these decreases were partially offset by increased check card revenue resulting from expanded card usage due in part to a rewards program initiated in  which offers cash rewards to customers who use their check card  and an increase in merchant services income 
loan and servicing income declined largely due to a write down on the valuation of the bank s mortgage servicing asset and the decrease in commercial real estate prepayment fees and letter of credit fees 
investment management  brokerage and insurance fees increased mainly due to the sales of fixed annuity products resulting from a favorable rate environment for these products 
an increase in the number of sales personnel and increased marketing efforts have contributed to the increased trading activity and the sales of investment products 
boli income decreased due to a decline in the average yield earned as a result of current market interest rates 
net gain on securities increased million primarily due to the restructuring in which resulted in a total charge of million 
excluding the restructuring  net gain on securities increased million due to gains recorded on the sale of mortgage backed securities 
these securities were sold at a premium and were sold in order to reduce prepayment and duration risk 
partially offsetting the gain on mortgage backed securities were other than temporary impairment charges of million and losses recorded on the sale of bank stocks in the second quarter of the impairment charges primarily relate to an investment in a trust preferred equity security issued by a regional bank in the amount of million and for preferred equity securities issued by freddie mac and lehman brothers in the amounts of  and  respectively  due to their sudden loss in market value 
the company did not expect the financial position of the regional bank or the current price of its security to improve meaningfully over the near term and also considered its market price to reflect enhanced risk in the timely realization of cashflows and it was  therefore  written down to market value through the income statement 
the lehman brothers preferred equity security was deemed impaired as a result of lehman brothers declaration of chapter bankruptcy in september the freddie mac preferred equity security was deemed impaired as a result of freddie mac being placed in conservatorship by the us treasury  frb and the federal housing finance agency 
additionally  dividends were halted on existing common and preferred securities and the us treasury invested billion in the form of senior preferred equity  which has priority over the company s preferred equity securities 
other income decreased mainly as a result of a prior year net gain on limited partnerships which resulted from the sale of an underlying investment compared to a net loss on limited partnerships in the current year period and a decrease in amounts earned on the outstanding balances of bank checks processed by a third party vendor due to the decline in market interest rates

the main driver of the increase was the fdic insurance premium 
there was also an increase in outside services  however  there was a reduction in expenses associated with the majority of all other non interest expense categories 
fdic insurance premium expense increased million from last year due to a a seven basis point increase in the assessment rate in the first quarter of and an additional two basis point increase in the assessment rate bringing the rate to fourteen basis points for the second quarter through the remainder of  b the exhaustion of the company s one time credit established by the federal deposit insurance reform act of in the first quarter of and c the special assessment in the second quarter of of million imposed by the fdic to provide for replenishment of the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the fdic required institutions to prepay their regular risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of   and on december  which amounted to approximately million 
included in the prepaid assessment was approximately million  which was recorded as expense in outside services increased primarily due to consulting costs associated with strategic planning initiatives and mortgage consulting costs 
salaries and employee benefits decreased as a result of reduced stock option expense as the majority of options granted to date became fully vested on december  and a decrease in restricted stock expense due to the retirement of executive officers in and salary expense also decreased due to a prior year severance payment for an executive who is no longer with the company  which was partially offset by current year severance payments 
partially offsetting the decreases were increased bonus accruals  an increase in pension plan expense due to the decline in the value of the pension assets and changes in assumptions for and additional expense in related to the supplemental executive retirement plan serp of approximately million resulting from the retirement of an executive officer in may and an unfavorable change in the discount rate associated with the measurement of the plan at december we expect to record additional serp expense in of approximately million due to the retirement of an executive officer in january and pension expense is expected to increase approximately million due to a decline in the discount rate for advertising  public relations and sponsorships declined primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to various media advertising and bonus campaigns to promote an array of business and consumer products 
during the second half of  advertising has picked up and we expect this trend to continue into due to planned media campaigns 
furniture and fixture expense decreased primarily due to a decline in depreciation expenses for various hardware and software that have been fully depreciated  ie branch and corporate telephone and computer systems 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased due to less amortization on core deposit intangibles from using the accelerated method of accounting whereas there was more amortization expense in compared to other expenses decreased due to reductions in general operating expenses partially offset by an increase in other real estate owned expenses as a result of the increased number of foreclosed properties 
comparison of and as displayed in table  non interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the main drivers of the increase were salaries and employee benefits and outside services  partially offset by decreases in amortization of identifiable intangible assets  merger related charges  and advertising  public relations and sponsorships 
salaries and employee benefits increased as a result of a severance recorded in the first quarter of for an executive who is no longer with the company b increased employee incentive accruals  including incentive payouts due to the increased sales of investment products c general merit increases d a decrease in capitalized salaries primarily due to the decline in commercial loan originations and e increased expense on the company s supplemental executive retirement plan compared to the twelve months ended december  due to changes in assumptions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in charges associated with the long term compensation plan ltcp for executives that are no longer with the company and a decrease in employee stock ownership plan expense due to the decline in the company s average year to date stock price 
outside services increased due to consulting costs associated with the implementation of a performance optimization project in an effort to enhance the overall effectiveness and revenue performance of the company 
during consulting costs for this project were approximately million 
outside services also increased due to charges incurred for outsourcing general internal audit work  legal and consulting costs related to human resources  partially offset by a decline in data processing expenses 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased due to using an accelerated method of amortization for core deposit intangibles which results in a higher level of expense in earlier periods and amortization of non compete agreements due to the expiration of all agreements in the third quarter of conversion and merger related charges decreased mainly due to charges for legal  consulting  advertising and data processing expense associated with the westbank acquisition that occurred in income tax expense income tax expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended  and were   and respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was due to an additional state tax liability as a result of new massachusetts legislation enacted in but effective in  an increase in of estimated non deductible excess remuneration pursuant to internal revenue code section m  the reduction in of favorable permanent differences  including bank owned life insurance income and the dividends received deduction  and the recognition in of the reversal of  of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions of prior years resulting from the settlement of the irs audit in the first quarter of the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was primarily due to the million increase in the valuation allowance required for the charitable contribution carryforward in and the reduction of  of unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions of prior years resulting from the settlement of the irs audit in the first quarter of newalliance continually monitors and evaluates the potential impact of current events and circumstances on the estimates used in the analysis of its income tax positions  and accordingly  newalliance s effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future 
newalliance evaluates its income tax positions based on tax laws and appropriate regulations and financial reporting considerations  and records adjustments as appropriate 
this evaluation takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities examinations of newalliance s tax returns and recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions  if any 
accordingly  the results of these examinations may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions taken by the company 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources financial condition summary from december  to december   total assets increased approximately million mainly due to an increase in investments  partially offset by a decline in loans 
liabilities increased million due to increases in deposits  partially offset by a decrease in borrowings 
stockholders equity increased million to billion due primarily to net income for the year ended december  and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the increase in the net unrealized gains on the investment portfolio  net of tax and an increase to recognize the year over year change in the funded position of the company s pension plans 
these increases are partially offset by dividends declared and treasury shares acquired 
investment securities the company maintains an investment securities portfolio that is primarily structured to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs  to generate interest income and to provide a means to balance interest rate sensitivity 
the securities portfolio is managed in accordance with regulatory guidelines and established internal corporate investment policies 
the following table sets forth certain financial information regarding the amortized cost and fair value of the company s investment portfolio at the dates indicated 
table investment securities december  december  december  amortized fair amortized fair amortized fair in thousands cost value cost value cost value available for sale us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations corporate obligations other bonds and obligations auction rate certficates marketable equity securities trust preferred equity securities private label residential mortgage backed securities residential mortgage backed securities total available for sale held to maturity residential mortgage backed securities other bonds total held to maturity total securities at december   the company had total investments of billion  or  of total assets 
the increase of million  from billion at december  was primarily the result of purchasing mortgage backed securities 
the company s increase in the investment portfolio was funded primarily by the growth in deposits and loan principal repayments 
while the company prefers lending as the primary use of its excess cash flows  the investment portfolio serves a secondary role in generating revenue while managing interest rate risk and liquidity 
the available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios are primarily composed of mortgage backed securities 
at december   mortgage backed securities comprised and of the total available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolios  respectively  the majority of which are issued by fannie mae and freddie mac 
the duration of the mortgage backed securities portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december the company s underlying investment strategy has been to purchase fnma and fhlmc hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  and seasoned and year government sponsored enterprise gse fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
the company has focused on the purchases of these securities due to their attractive spreads versus funding costs and for their monthly cash flows that provide the company with liquidity 
this strategy is also supplemented with select purchases of bullet and callable agency securities 
the average life for mortgage backed securities  when purchased  would range between two and four years and the maturity dates for agency obligations would range between one and five years 
fasb guidance requires the company to designate its securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading depending on the company s intent regarding its investments at the time of purchase 
the company does not currently maintain a portfolio of trading securities 
as of december   billion  or of the portfolio  was classified as available for sale and million of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
the company believes that the high concentration of securities available for sale allows flexibility in the day to day management of the overall investment portfolio  consistent with the objectives of optimizing profitability and mitigating interest rate risk 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value 
additional information about fair value measurements can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter of new other than temporary impairment otti guidance  fasb asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  was adopted and  for debt securities  requires that credit related otti be recognized in earnings while non credit related otti be recognized in other comprehensive income oci unless there is intent to sell or are required to sell 
the new guidance also requires that previously recorded impairment charges that do not relate to a credit loss be reclassified from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
therefore  during the quarter ended june   the company reclassified the non credit related portion of a previously recorded otti loss  as described below 
also during  the company recorded current otti losses on two securities in accordance with this new guidance  both of which are described below 
during  one of the individual name trust preferred securities was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter 
upon the adoption of the otti guidance discussed above  the company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment that increased retained earnings and decreased aoci by million  or million  net of tax 
a credit related otti loss in the amount of  was recorded against the company s position in an adjustable rate mortgage mutual fund that holds positions in non agency mortgage backed securities 
during the second quarter of  the fund experienced its first realized loss on a mortgage investment and management determined that the dollar amount of securities carrying a rating of ccc or lower had increased 
this decrease in the credit quality of the securities coupled with the loss recognized by the fund  resulted in management s determination that the fund was other than temporarily impaired and a credit impairment of  was recorded 
the credit related impairment was determined by applying the midpoint of the estimated default rates of ccc  cc and c rated securities to the investments in the portfolio and adjusting the par value downward by these estimated losses 
a white paper written by one of the rating agencies outlining estimated default ranges on residential private mortgage backed securities based upon credit rating was utilized by the company for its analysis 
the non credit related otti was million  or million  net of tax  and was recognized in oci 
in december  an additional credit impairment was recorded in the amount of  and was determined using the same methodology 
as of december   the fund has a current book value of million 
there is no intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell these securities 
a credit related otti loss in the amount of  was recorded on a pooled trust preferred security in december based on cash flow analyses 
the company received nine cash flow scenarios from the underwriter which were utilized by management to analyze this security for potential otti 
the nine scenarios covered various default rates  recovery rates and prepayment options over different time periods 
two of the nine cash flow analyses indicated impairment over the life of the security 
the driver of the indicated impairment was the recovery rate  which was modeled at in these two cash flow scenarios 
as the severity of the estimated loss in these two cash flow scenarios doubled since the prior otti analysis in the third quarter of and due to the fact that the past history of the security indicates that there have not been any recoveries to date from securities that have defaulted  the company recorded a credit related impairment charge 
the credit impairment represents the average loss of the two negative cash flow analyses 
the non credit related impairment of million  or  net of tax  was recognized in oci 
after the write down  the cost basis of the security was million at december  there is no intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell this security 
the net unrealized gain on securities classified as available for sale as of december  was million compared to an unrealized gain of million as of december  the appreciation in the market value of securities available for sale was primarily due to the increase in the fair value of mortgage backed securities and the unrealized gains on the mortgage backed securities purchased during the year  partially offset by gains on securities sold 
the net unrealized gain on the available for sale investment portfolio  that is primarily within the mortgage backed securities  is partially offset by unrealized losses on trust preferred equity securities and privately issued mortgage backed securities 
the changes in unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio are primarily due to credit spreads  liquidity and fluctuations in market interest rates during the period 
the net unrealized gain on mortgage backed securities is primarily from agency mortgage backed securities issued by fnma and fhlmc  partially offset by unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities issued by private institutions 
the unrealized gain on agency mortgage backed securities is due to the general decline in interest rates and the tightening in mortgage backed security spreads 
spreads have tightened in part due to programs initiated by the federal reserve to purchase the direct obligations of housing related gse s  fannie mae  freddie mac  and the fhlb s  and mortgage backed securities issued by fannie mae  freddie mac  and ginnie mae 
the goal of these purchases has been to maintain lower long term fixed mortgage rates to stimulate the housing market and improve the overall conditions in private credit markets 
these programs consist of the frb purchasing a total of trillion of agency mortgage backed securities and up to billion of agency debt 
the unrealized loss on mortgage backed securities primarily relates to securities issued by private institutions and is primarily concentrated in one bbb rated private label mortgage backed security which is substantially paid down  well seasoned and of an earlier vintage that has not been significantly affected by high delinquency levels or vulnerable to lower collateral coverage as seen in later issued pools 
widening in non agency mortgage spreads is the primary factor for the unrealized losses reported on private label mortgage backed securities 
none of the securities are backed by subprime mortgage loans and none have suffered losses 
one of the private issue securities was downgraded to bbb during the third quarter of and the remaining securities are rated aaa 
all are still paying principal and interest and are expected to continue to pay their contractual cash flows 
the company does not have any commercial mortgage backed securities 
management s review of the above factors and issuer specific data concluded that these private label mortgage backed securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
the unrealized losses on other bonds and obligations primarily relates to the non credit related otti loss on a position in an adjustable rate mortgage mutual fund that holds positions in non agency mortgage backed securities that are facing negative mark to market pressures due to widening spreads in non agency mortgage products 
although the fund has experienced declines in credit ratings since the beginning of the year  it was not due to customer redemptions or forced selling of the investments 
the fund recorded its first loss which factored into management s determination that the fund was other than temporarily impaired 
as discussed above  a credit related otti loss of  was recorded through earnings during the year ended december  the fund carries a market value to book value ratio of  a weighted average underlying investment credit rating of a and it continues to pay normal monthly dividends 
there is no intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell these securities 
the unrealized losses on auction rate certificates relate to certificates issued by an investment banking firm and are pools of government guaranteed student loans that are issued by state student loan departments 
in the first half of  the auction process for auction rate certificates began to freeze resulting from the problems in the credit markets 
these securities are currently rated aaa and are still paying their contractual cash flows and are expected to continue to pay their contractual cash flows 
management has concluded that no other than temporary impairment exists as of december  there is no intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell these securities 
in  the underwriter entered into a settlement agreement with several state regulatory agencies  whereby they have agreed to repurchase these certificates from both their retail and institutional customers at par 
the institutional buy back of these securities is scheduled on or around june  trust preferred securities are comprised of two pooled trust preferreds with an amortized cost of million  one of which is rated bb and the other is rated bbb 
the remaining million are comprised of twelve individual names issues with the following ratings million rated a to a  million rated bbb and million rated bb to bb 
except for the bb rated pooled trust preferred security  the unrealized losses reported for trust preferred equity securities relate to the financial and liquidity stresses in the fixed income markets 
although the ratings on some issues have been reduced since december   all are currently paying the contractual principal and interest payments 
a detailed review of the two pooled trust preferreds and the individual names trust preferred equity securities was completed which included an analysis of collateral reports  cash flows  stress default levels and financial ratios of the underlying issuers 
as discussed above  a credit related otti loss of  was recorded through earnings during the year ended december  on one of the pooled trust preferred securities 
management has performed a review of all investments with unrealized losses and determined that no other investments had credit related other than temporary impairment 
the company has no intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell any of these securities within the time necessary to recover the unrealized losses which may be until maturity 
the company does not plan on investing in securities backed by subprime mortgage collateral 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yield and contractual maturities of the company s investment portfolio as of december  in the case of mortgage backed securities  the table shows the securities by their contractual maturities  however  there are scheduled principal payments and there will be unscheduled prepayments prior to their contractual maturity

residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio as of december   comprising over fifty percent of total loans 
the decrease of million from december  was primarily due to prepayments outweighing new originations for the portfolio during the year 
this is attributable to the decline in interest rates to historically low levels resulting in customer refinancing to lock in fixed rate mortgages 
although the company had record originations of both adjustable and fixed rate mortgages of billion during the year  approximately million was originated for portfolio and the remainder was sold in the secondary market 
the company currently sells the majority of all originated fixed rate residential real estate loans with terms of years or more 
during the third quarter of  the company began to retain in its portfolio year jumbo fixed rate residential mortgage originations and for these originations totaled approximately million 
the company anticipates that mortgage origination activity will continue to be robust while interest rates remain low  but likely not at the levels 
the residential real estate loan portfolio has a weighted average fico score of and a current estimated weighted loan to value ratio of 
included in residential real estate is a purchased portfolio  which is made up of prime loans individually re underwritten by the company to our underwriting criteria  and includes adjustable rate and and year fixed rate residential real estate loans with property locations throughout the united states with no significant exposure in any particular state 
at december  the company s purchased portfolio had an outstanding balance of approximately million with the largest concentration in our footprint of connecticut and massachusetts at  followed by california and new york  which each make up approximately 
newalliance plans on resuming purchases when loan pools are available that meet its criteria 
commercial real estate loans increased million and commercial business loans decreased million from december  in general  loan growth has slowed due to current economic conditions 
originations  especially during the first half of  were dominated by financing requests from current customers and less from new customers 
this was due  in part  to fewer opportunities that met our underwriting and credit quality standards 
more opportunities are emerging in the form of refinances away from larger national banks as they have been internally focused or are targeting an up market customer base 
this has led mid sized businesses to look to regional community banks for relationship banking and personalized lending services 
the commercial construction portfolio of million includes approximately million of loans to commercial borrowers for residential housing development  million of which are for condominium projects 
the decrease in commercial construction of million is due to a decrease in residential housing development loans through a negotiated settlement  paydowns and further charge offs on nonperforming condominium projects  partly offset by originations of commercial construction to permanent loans 
although the company s commercial portfolios have declined  our long term strategy continues to be that of building a larger percentage of the company s assets in commercial loans including real estate and other business loans 
in the fourth quarter of  the company formed an asset based lending business 
asset based lending expands the bank s business lending offerings to include revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivable  inventory  and other assets 
an asset based loan is collateralized with a customer s balance sheet assets  which are considered the primary source of loan repayment 
this type of financing is particularly attractive to start up and growth companies  as well as those in restructuring  turn around  or other financially distressed situations that result in the inability to secure traditional commercial lending 
we remain an active commercial lender and will continue promoting strong business development efforts to obtain new business banking relationships  while maintaining strong credit quality and profitability 
we believe that our status as a healthy regional community bank focused on relationship banking bodes well for us to retain customers and to be a source for new businesses 
home equity loans and lines of credit decreased million from december  to december  the company continues to offer competitive pricing and is committed to growing this loan segment while maintaining credit quality 
however  as a result of the interest rate environment during  consumer demand shifted to residential mortgages and away from home equity products  attributing to the year over year decline in the portfolio 
the weighted average fico score and current estimated weighted combined loan to value ratio for home equity loans and lines of credit is and  respectively 
lending has been from organic originations in the company s market area  none of which is subprime

the company has a carrying value of million of commercial construction loans for residential development 
all of these loans are collateralized and carry a reserve allocation of approximately million 
this segment has total delinquencies of million  all of which are in the over day category 
within the residential portfolio  management uses two main early warning techniques to more closely monitor credit deterioration 
the company uses a matrix to identify where the concentration of outstanding loans fall in the risk continuum 
this matrix is constructed using estimated current loan to value ranges current balance ltv adjusted for estimated appreciation or depreciation in the appraised value and the latest available fico score ranges rescored quarterly 
the company considers loans with an estimated current loan to value ratio above and a fico score less than to be higher risk 
once identified  the higher risk loans are then reviewed by the special assets department to determine what  if any  action should be taken to mitigate possible loss exposure 
at december   higher risk loans comprised approximately million  or of the residential real estate portfolio 
the company also tracks loans that have a fico score that has declined points or more and are below as of december  loans meeting this criteria represent approximately million  or of the residential portfolio 
the estimated current ltv is determined using several methods including the case schiller composite home price index  the national association of realtors quarterly report on msa level house price averages  and an automated valuation random sampling across vintages and regions 
updated appraisals are generally obtained at days past due or at any point management determines that full repayment of the loan is unlikely 
asset quality loans are placed on nonaccrual if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt  if the loan has been restructured  or if any payment of principal or interest is past due days or more 
a loan may be returned to accrual status if it has demonstrated sustained contractual performance or if all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period 
as displayed in table  nonperforming assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december  the increase is primarily due to loans secured by residential one to four family loans and commercial business loans  partially offset by a decline in commercial real estate and commercial construction loans 
the increase in nonperforming residential loans of million was due to current economic conditions including factors such as the rise in unemployment rates reaching a twenty six year high and the continued softness in the real estate market 
the residential nonperforming category totaled million  representing of the total residential portfolio  just over half of which have property locations in connecticut and massachusetts 
the company routinely updates fico scores and ltv ratios and continues to originate loans with superior credit characteristics 
through continued heightened account monitoring  collections and workout efforts  the bank is committed to mortgage solution programs to assist homeowners to remain in their homes 
as has been its practice historically  the company does not originate subprime loans 
there are approximately million in restructured loans which have been modified from their original contractual terms and are included in nonperforming residential loans 
in the course of resolving nonperforming loans  the bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain real estate loans 
contractual terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with their current financial status which may be a reduction in interest rate to market rate or below  a change in the term  movement of the past due amounts to the back end of the loan or refinance 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon being restructured  even if they were not previously 
the bank s policy to restore a loan to performing status includes the receipt of regular payments  generally for period of six months 
the increase in nonperforming commercial business loans was primarily due to the general deterioration of economic conditions that have led to the inability of some businesses to properly service their debt 
the decline in nonperforming commercial real estate and commercial construction loans primarily relates to charge offs recorded against a number of loans  note sales and pay downs  the majority of which were condominium projects within the residential housing development segment 
as of december   the construction to permanent segment of commercial construction loans had no delinquencies or nonaccruals 
activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months and household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses  sluggish income growth  lower housing wealth  and tight credit 
if unfavorable economic and real estate market conditions persist or deteriorate further  there will be added stress on our loan portfolios 
the company believes  however  that its historical practice of prudent underwriting  the relatively modest size of its residential construction portfolio and strong average fico scores combined with low weighted average loan to value ratios associated with its residential portfolio are significant advantages in keeping asset quality manageable

when a property is placed in other real estate owned  the excess of the loan balance over the estimated fair market value of the collateral  based on a recent appraisal  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
estimated fair value usually represents the sales price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions  including normal loan terms from other financial institutions  less the estimated costs to sell the property 
management inspects all other real estate owned properties periodically 
subsequent writedowns in the carrying value of other real estate owned are charged to expense if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
at december   the company had million in other real estate owned 
due to current market conditions the company does expect foreclosure activity to increase moderately in classification of assets and loan review an internal risk rating system is used to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in the commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios 
under our internal risk rating system  we currently identify criticized loans as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
on a quarterly basis  a criticized asset committee composed of senior officers meet to review criticized asset reports on commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans that are risk rated special mention  substandard  or doubtful 
the reports and the committee focus on the current status  strategy  financial data  and appropriate risk rating of the criticized loan 
the internal risk ratings are subject to change based on the committee s review and approval 
in addition to the internal review  semi annually  the bank engages a third party to conduct a review of the commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios 
the primary purpose of the third party review is to evaluate the loan portfolio with respect to the risk rating profiles 
differences between the third party review and the internal risk ratings are discussed and rating classifications are adjusted accordingly 
at december   loans classified as substandard both accruing and nonaccruing totaled million  and consisted of million in commercial real estate loans  million in construction lines and million in commercial loans 
included in loans classified as substandard are million of loans that are considered impaired and carry a specific reserve of million 
impaired loans are measured based on either collateral values supported by appraisals  observed market prices or where potential losses have been identified and reserved accordingly 
special mention loans totaled million  and consisted of million of commercial real estate loans  million in construction lines and million of commercial loans 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  at december   loans classified as substandard both accruing and nonaccruing totaled million  and consisted of million in commercial real estate loans  million in construction lines and million in commercial loans 
special mention loans totaled million  and consisted of million of commercial real estate loans  million in construction lines and million of commercial loans 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  allowance for loan losses the board of directors and management of the company are committed to the establishment and maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses  determined in accordance with gaap 
our approach is to follow the most recent guidelines that have been provided by our regulators 
management believes that the methodology it employs to develop  monitor and support the allowance for loan losses is consistent with those guidelines 
while management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for losses  thereby negatively affecting the company s financial condition and earnings 
moreover  actual losses may be dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the allowance for loan losses may become necessary 
the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses based on management s on going evaluation of the risks inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans when it is determined that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth activity in the company s allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated table schedule of allowance for loan losses at or for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period    net allowances gained through acquisition  provision for loan losses    charge offs residential real estate loans commercial real estate loans commercial construction commercial business loans consumer loans total charge offs recoveries residential real estate loans commerical real estate loans commerical construction commercial business loans consumer loans total recoveries net charge offs    balance at end of period    ratios net loan charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans net charged off to allowance for loan losses total recoveries to charge offs deteriorating market conditions have been affecting loan portfolios since the latter part of as displayed in table  the company recorded net charge offs of million during the year ended december   compared to net charge offs of million for the year ended december  the majority of the charge offs in the residential category were adjustments based on current appraisals which continue to show the depression in home values while persisting adverse economic and housing pressures are affecting charge off levels in the commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial business portfolios 
as a result of the net charge offs  changes in nonaccrual and delinquent loans and adversely classified loan indicators  a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the company has a loan loss allowance of million  or of total loans as compared to a loan loss allowance of million  or of total loans at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and directionally consistent with asset quality and delinquency indicators and that it represents the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
to achieve this best estimate  numerous factors are evaluated and applied to the allowance for loan loss calculation 
management continues to assess loss factors based on recent economic events and incorporates that into the calculation 
the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio at december  was compared to at december  this ratio has declined because growth in the allowance is not proportional to growth in nonperforming loans due to classification of nonperforming loans is a backward looking indicator  often loans with credit weaknesses are identified and allocated higher levels of reserves if appropriate before becoming nonperforming  the majority of the company s nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collateral and while the entire loan is classified as nonperforming  only the amount of estimated losses would have been captured in the allowance for loan losses  the growth in nonperforming loans this year was concentrated in residential real estate loans in which the loss in event of default is traditionally low  certain nonperforming loans have already been partially charged off to the expected net realizable value and a portion of the allowance is to cover losses established under fasb asc  contingencies  for performing loans 
performing loans have not grown at the same rate as nonperforming loans 
the company employs a formal quarterly process to assess the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the process is designed to adequately capture inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the company s percent of allowance by loan category and the percent of the loans to total loans in each of the categories listed at the dates indicated table allocation of allowance for loan losses at december  percent of percent of percent of percent of percent of loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in each each each each each category to category to category to category to category to dollars in thousands amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans amount total loans residential real estate   commercial real estate   commercial construction    commercial business    consumer    unallocated     total allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses and the provision are determined based upon a detailed evaluation of the portfolio and sub portfolios through a process which considers numerous factors  including levels and direction of delinquencies  nonperforming loans  risk ratings  estimated credit losses using both internal and external portfolio reviews  current economic and market conditions  concentrations  industry data  peer comparisons  portfolio volume and mix  changes in underwriting  experience of staff  and historical loss rates over the business cycle 
the bank evaluates the allowance for loan loss requirements through an analysis of all impaired loans in accordance with impairment guidance within fasb asc receivables fas  with the balance of the portfolios  not impaired  analyzed under the guidelines of fasb asc contingencies fas  using a measurement of estimated credit losses based on historical loss rates adjusted for qualitative and environmental factors 
the qualitative and environmental factors include but are not limited to estimated embedded losses in non performing loans and criticized loans not impaired estimated losses in high risk residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit increased portfolio delinquencies changes in risk ratings and macro economic conditions  including unemployment  consumer confidence  and continued softness in the real estate market 
management follows a guiding principle that the level of the allowance for loan losses should be directionally consistent with asset quality indicators 
in establishing an acceptable range of losses for the total portfolio  the bank considers a high and low range of losses and a historical net loss analysis on individual loan portfolios 
the loan loss allowance allocations as of december  are between these high and low ranges 
management does not expect losses in this economic cycle to exceed the losses experienced in the early s 
the unallocated reserve increased slightly to million  or of the total reserve  for inherent losses  yet unidentified due to the current state of the economy 
the is on the high side of management s established range of to  which is appropriate based on the current economic environment 
the provision and allowance for loan losses are then reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had intangible assets of million  a decrease of million  from million at december  the decrease is due to year to date amortization expense for core deposit and customer relationship intangibles 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis  over their estimated lives 
management assesses the recoverability of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded to income 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances exist that indicate a possible reduction in the fair value of the business below its carrying value 
for purposes of goodwill impairment evaluation  the bank is identified as the reporting unit 
the company engaged an independent third party to assist with the annual test for goodwill impairment during the first quarter of the analysis performed evaluated the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of four valuation methodologies including  the public market peers approach  the comparable transactions approach  the control premium approach and a discounted cash flow approach 
based on the analysis  the company concluded an impairment charge was not deemed necessary 
given the economic climate and the company s market capitalization at the third quarter of  management reviewed a number of events that could potentially trigger the requirement to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
the review consisted of an analysis of potential triggering events  including  but not limited to a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  c unanticipated competition  d cash flow or operating losses  e long term outlooks for specific industries and f market capitalization of the company below its book value 
the fact that the market capitalization of the company was below its book value at september  was outweighed by the lack of other triggering events and management concluded that no events or circumstances occurred through september  which indicated that the carrying value of the company s goodwill may be impaired 
although the company s market capitalization was below its book value as of december   management again concluded that no events or circumstances subsequent to these evaluations through year end indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
sources of funds cash flows from deposits  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  securities sales proceeds and maturities  borrowings and earnings are the primary sources of the company s funds available for use in its lending and investment activities and in meeting its operational needs 
while scheduled loan and securities repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and investment security prepayments are influenced by prevailing interest rates and local and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain 
the borrowings primarily include fhlb advances and repurchase agreement borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further borrowings information 
the company attempts to control the flow of funds in its deposit accounts according to its need for funds and the cost of alternative sources of funding 
a loan and deposit pricing committee meets weekly to determine pricing and marketing initiatives 
actions of the committee influence the flow of funds primarily by the pricing of deposits  which is affected to a large extent by competitive factors in its market area and asset liability management strategies 
deposits the company receives retail and commercial deposits through its main office and other banking offices throughout connecticut locations and massachusetts locations 
customer deposits generated through the newalliance banking network are the largest source of funds used to support asset growth 
deposit customers can access their accounts in a variety of ways including branch banking  atm s  internet banking or telephone banking 
effective advertising  direct mail  well designed product offerings  customer service and competitive pricing policies have been successful in attracting and retaining deposits 
a key strategic objective is to grow the base of checking customers by retaining existing relationships while attracting new customers 
the deposit base provides a source of funding for the bank as well as an ongoing stream of fee revenue 
the company offers a wide variety of deposit accounts including checking  savings and certificate of deposit accounts that meet the needs of both the consumer and business customers 
table deposits december  in thousands change savings    money market    now    demand    time    total deposits as displayed in table  deposits increased million compared to december  the company s strategy has been to increase core deposits and reduce rates paid on interest bearing deposits  particularly on time deposits  in order to improve the net interest margin and the interest rate spread while continuing to build core relationships 
through well designed product offerings  the company has been able to grow core deposits by million  or  particularly through the company s money market and savings products 
the bank has also been focused on growing core deposits by launching essential checking and essential savings in the beginning of the year  which encompasses an interest bearing checking  a competitively priced savings account and a cash rewards debit card 
money market deposits have shown significant increases and have grown approximately million from year end due to the premium money market product which offers competitive pricing with a tiered rate structure 
the company has executed several programs  including telephone and direct mail campaigns to retain valued  higher balance deposit accounts through the cross sell strategy of offering our best banking product premium alliance checking and its companion accounts premium savings and premium money market 
as a result  the company was able to attract both retail and business customers throughout also positively impacting money market deposit balances was the transfer of approximately million of the bank s trust customer funds  awaiting investment or distribution  from institutional money market funds and into a money market account within the bank 
partially offsetting the growth in core deposits was a decrease in time deposit accounts of approximately million  as the company repriced maturing cd s at reduced rates causing retention of time deposits to drop 
however  the company was able to retain some of the time deposit balances through the free savings and premium money market products that offer competitive interest rates 
the company had million in time deposits of  or more outstanding as of december   maturing as follows table time deposit maturities of  or more weighted average dollars in thousands amount rate three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  total time deposits  or more borrowings newalliance uses various types of short term and long term borrowings to meet funding needs 
while customer deposits remain the primary source of funding loan originations  management uses short term and long term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and liquidity needs when the cost of these funds are favorable compared to alternative funding  including deposits 
the company is a member of the fhlb boston regional bank which is part of the fhlb 
members are required to retain capital stock in the fhlb boston and borrowings are collateralized by certain home mortgages and securities of the us government and its agencies 
the company s borrowing capacity at the fhlb boston is determined by the amount of fhlb boston capital stock owned by the company and the amount of loan and investment assets pledged to the fhlb boston by the company as collateral 
the following table summarizes the company s recorded borrowings at december  table borrowings december  in thousands change fhlb advances    repurchase agreements    mortgage loans payable   junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts total borrowings includes fair value adjustments on acquired borrowings  in accordance with purchase accounting standards of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
includes fair value adjustments on acquired borrowings  in accordance with purchase accounting standards of and  at december  and december   respectively 
the trusts were organized to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities 
the company acquired these subsidiaries when it acquired alliance bancorp of new england  inc and westbank corporation  inc 
the affiliated trusts are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and the payments of these securities are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the company 
the acquisition fair value adjustments premiums are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense on borrowings over their remaining term using the level yield method 
table above summarizes the company s recorded borrowings of billion at december   a decrease of million from the balance recorded at december   mainly in fhlb advances 
the decrease in fhlb advances was primarily due to principal pay downs and maturing advances  partially offset by new advances at reduced rates 
due to the growth in core deposits  the company has substantially reduced its originated borrowings with the fhlb in as a result  the company was able to lessen its reliance on borrowings from the fhlb by utilizing excess customer deposits to originate loans  invest in securities and meet other liquidity needs  while managing interest rate risk 
at december   all of the company s outstanding fhlb advances were at fixed rates ranging from to 
the decrease of million in repurchase agreements is primarily due to a decline in commercial customer repurchase agreements which fluctuate based on the operating needs of the customers and due to the low levels of market interest rates  some customer balances shifted to demand deposit and savings products 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity equaled billion at december   an increase of million compared to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to year to date earnings of million and an increase in the fair market value of available for sale investment securities of million  net of tax and an increase of million to recognize the year over year change in the funded position of the company s pension plans 
the increase in equity was partially offset by million for the payment of cash dividends declared on our common stock during the year ended december  for information regarding our compliance with applicable capital requirements  see liquidity and capital position below 
dividends declared for the year to date period ended december  were per share compared to per share for the same period last year 
on january   the company declared a per share cash dividend payable on february  to shareholders of record on february  this was the company s rd consecutive quarterly dividend payment 
book value per share amounted to and at december  and december   respectively  and tangible book value amounted to and at the same dates  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future short term financial obligations 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments and sales  maturities  paydowns and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities  borrowings from the fhlb and repurchase agreements 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investment activities during any given period 
at december   cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year amounted to million  or of total assets 
the company manages liquidity by determining its cash position daily 
the investment department compiles reports detailing the company s cash activity and cash balances occurring at its various correspondents and through its various funding sources 
the investment department then settles all correspondent and bank accounts by either investing excess funds or borrowing to cover the projected shortfall 
factors affecting liquidity include loan origination volumes  loan prepayment rates  maturity structure of existing loans  core deposit growth levels  time deposit maturity structure and retention  investment portfolio cash flows  the market value of investment securities that can be used to collateralize fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
the liquidity position is influenced by general interest rate levels  economic conditions and competition 
for example  as interest rates decline  payments of principal from the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio accelerate  as borrowers are more willing to prepay 
additionally  the market value of the securities portfolio generally increases as rates decline  thereby increasing the amount of collateral available for funding purposes 
the company has used borrowings from the fhlb boston to fund loan growth while managing interest rate risk and liquidity  however  during the company was able to reduce its reliance on the fhlb due to the growth in core deposits 
at december   total borrowings from the fhlb amounted to billion  exclusive of million in purchase accounting adjustments  and the company had the immediate capacity to increase that total to billion 
additional borrowing capacity of approximately billion would be readily available by pledging eligible investment securities as collateral 
depending on market conditions and the company s liquidity and gap position  the company may continue to borrow from the fhlb or initiate borrowings through the repurchase agreement market 
at december  the company s repurchase agreement lines of credit with three large broker dealers totaled million  million of which was available on that date 
agreement terms vary based on the collateral submitted 
newalliance s main source of liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from newalliance bank 
the main uses of liquidity are payments of dividends to common stockholders  repurchase of newalliance s common stock  the payment of principal and interest to holders of trust preferred securities  and help fund acquisitions 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information on dividend restrictions 
at december   the company had commitments to originate loans  unused outstanding lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling million 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  therefore  total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments and contractual obligations 
time deposits maturing within one year from december  amount to billion 
fhlb advances maturing within one year from december  amount to million and interest payments of approximately million are payable in management believes that the cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year  coupled with the borrowing line at the fhlb and the available repurchase agreement lines at selected broker dealers  provide for sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs 
if unforeseen market conditions or counterparty risk placed limitations on our ability to borrow from either the fhlb or the repurchase market  the company would be able to utilize the frb s discount window to obtain funds 
in october  the company filed a shelf registration with the sec  which facilitates increased flexibility to seize market opportunities as they present themselves 
the following tables present information indicating various obligations and commitments of the company as of december  and the respective maturity dates 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any terms or covenants established in the contract and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
table contractual obligations over one year over three years through three through five in thousands total one year or less years years over five years fhlb advances     repurchase agreements    mortgage loans payable   junior subordinated debentures issued to affiliated trusts  operating leases      tax reserves and interest total contractual obligations secured under a blanket security agreement on qualifying assets  principally mortgage loans

unadvanced portions of home equity loans are available to be drawn on at any time by the borrower for up to years 
commercial lines of credit are available to be drawn on at any time by the borrower for up to or years 
applicable regulations require the company and the bank to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements 
at december   the company and the bank were in full compliance with all applicable capital requirements and met the fdic requirements for a well capitalized institution 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the section titled regulation and supervision in item  concerning capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  newalliance engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us gaap  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers request for funding 
for the year ended december   newalliance did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions that would have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market and interest rate risk general market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has no foreign currency or commodity price risk 
credit risk related to investment securities is mitigated as the majority are government agency securities 
the chief market risk factor affecting financial condition and operating results is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates and spreads 
this risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given the company s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net earnings to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee  comprised of numerous senior executives  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors reviews the company s gap position and interest rate sensitivity exposure described below and asset liability committee minutes detailing the company s activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company s operating results  interest rate risk position and the effect changes in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income 
the extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings 
the principal strategies used to manage interest rate risk include i emphasizing the origination  purchase and retention of adjustable rate loans  and the origination and purchase of loans with maturities matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans  ii investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and or average lives and iii classifying a significant portion of its investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management 
by its strategy of limiting the bank s risk to rising interest rates  the bank is also limiting the benefit of falling interest rates 
the company employs two approaches to interest rate risk measurement  gap analysis and income simulation analysis 
gap analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is deemed to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s cumulative one year interest rate gap which is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was positive million  or positive of total assets 
the bank s approved policy limit is plus or minus 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
the following table sets forth the company s cumulative maturity distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio  and cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities ratio 
this table indicates the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
assumptions are made on the rate of prepayment of principal on loans and investment securities and on the sensitivity of accounts with indeterminate maturity dates 
however  this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest yield because the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the gap analysis  so that when interest rates rise  the gap becomes more negative  and when interest rates fall  the gap becomes more positive 
as a result  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same time period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
it should also be noted that this table reflects certain assumptions regarding the categorization of assets and liabilities and represents a one day position  in fact  variations occur daily as management adjusts interest rate sensitivity throughout the year

tested scenarios include instantaneous rate shocks  rate ramps over a six month or one year period  static rates  non parallel shifts in the yield curve and a forward rate scenario 
these simulation analysis are used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a three year period 
simulation analysis involves projecting a future balance sheet structure and interest income and expense under the various rate scenarios 
the company s internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for a range of interest rate scenarios  the estimated net interest margin over the next months should decline by less than as compared to the forecasted net interest margin in the base case scenario 
however  in practice  interest rate risk is managed well within these guidelines 
for the base case rate scenario the yield curve as of december  was utilized 
this yield curve was utilized due to continued uncertainty regarding the strength of the recovering economy as well as due to the comments from various frb officials that interest rates would likely remain flat for an extended period 
as of december   the company s estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve month period as compared to the forecasted net interest income in the base case scenario are as follows percentage change in estimated net interest income over twelve months basis point upward shock in interest rates basis point downward shock in interest rates as of december   a downward rate shock of basis points was a realistic representation of the risk of falling rates as the frb has reduced the overnight lending rate target to a range between and 
for an increase in rates  an upward rate shock of basis points is also a relevant representation of potential risk given the recent beginnings of an economic rebound due to the past reductions in the federal funds rate  the benefits of the government stimulus package and the expansion of the frb s balance sheet 
based on the scenarios above  net interest income would increase slightly in the month period after an upward movement in rates  and would decrease slightly after a downward movement in rates 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on time deposits and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
