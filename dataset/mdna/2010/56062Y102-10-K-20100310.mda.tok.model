the decrease from to in overall net income and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the  increase in the company s loan loss provision expense 
the increase in provision expense was partially offset by an increase of  in net interest income as the company s net interest margin increased by basis points year over year and average earning assets increased  key measures of the operating performance of the company are return on average assets  return on average common shareholders equity  and efficiency ratio

the company was able to match reductions in its yield on earning assets with a corresponding reduction in its cost of funds 
over the three year period interest income has been stable as increases in earning assets have offset decreases in yield 
yields on loans decreased over the past three years as variable rate loans have adjusted downward 
this is most notable in commercial loans  as the prime rate was flat throughout at  after trending downward during the federal reserve bank continues to target the fed funds rate at

table of contents non interest income non interest income was  for compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  or 
increases in mortgage banking  service charges on deposit accounts  and interchange income were the primary causes of the increase 
the low mortgage rates offered by freddie mac throughout the year resulted in increased mortgage refinance activity throughout in addition  the company expanded its geographic footprint and the markets it serves through acquisition activity in the latter part of and the first half of an increase in deposit accounts from the full year effect of recent acquisitions resulted in increased service charges and interchange income 
non interest income as a percent of non interest expense was for compared to for the decrease was caused by the goodwill impairment charge taken in total non interest income was  for compared to  for  an increase of  and increases in service charges on deposit accounts  interchange income and gains on the sale of investment securities were offset by the decrease in mortgage banking income and a reduction in income related to bank owned life insurance policies as the company recorded a charge on its separate account investments 
despite an increase in the level of mortgage loans originated for sale  mortgage banking income decreased as the company incurred an impairment charge of  related to its mortgage servicing rights 
non interest expense total non interest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  and 
the increase was primarily attributable to goodwill impairment charges of  based on the company s annual testing of goodwill for impairment  it was determined that goodwill was impaired and an impairment charge of  was taken in the second quarter and a  charge was taken in the fourth quarter 
to a smaller degree  additional fdic premiums of  and normal employee merit increases  a slight increase in the number of full time equivalent employees  and additional branches as a result of acquisition activity caused increases in non interest expenses 
total non interest expense was  in compared to  in  an increase of  and

income taxes the effective tax rate was in  in  and in the decrease in the company s effective tax rate from to was primarily due to the non deductibility of a portion of the goodwill impairment taken as well as lower pretax earnings 
the decrease in the company s effective tax rate from to was primarily attributable to lower pretax earnings with earnings from tax exempt assets remaining relatively flat 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns

increases in securities and other assets were offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents  loans  and goodwill 
loans  credit risk and the allowance and provision for loan losses loans remain the company s largest concentration of assets and continue to represent the greatest potential risk 
the loan underwriting standards observed by the bank are viewed by management as a means of controlling problem loans and the resulting charge offs 
the company also believes credit risks may be elevated if undue concentrations of loans in specific industry segments and to out of area borrowers are incurred 
accordingly  the company s board of directors regularly monitors such concentrations to determine compliance with its loan concentration policy 
the company believes it has no undue concentrations of loans 
total loans excluding those held for sale decreased by  from year end approximately half of this decrease was in the company s residential real estate portfolio as the majority of newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans were sold to the secondary market 
the remaining decrease was the result of reduced loan demand primarily in the construction and development area during residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest portion of the total loan portfolio and were of total loans at december  compared to of total loans at the end of

as a general rule  commercial and real estate loans are reclassified to nonaccrual status at or before becoming days past due 
interest previously recorded is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent interest payments collected on nonaccrual loans are thereafter applied as a reduction of the loan s principal balance 
non performing loans were  as of december  compared to  as of december  and represented of total loans at december  versus one year ago 
the following table details the company s non performing loans as of december for the years indicated 
non performing loans nonaccruing loans accruing loans contractually past due days or more total of total loans 
table of contents over of the non accrual loan balance was attributable to large credit relationships over  these loans are primarily land development and real estate backed loans 
the company is working with these borrowers in an attempt to minimize its losses 
the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the increase in the company s provision in was primarily due to the increase in non performing loans  the increase in net charge offs during  and the deterioration of the economy and real estate market 
net charge offs were  in compared to  in and  in as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs equaled   and in  and  respectively 
the large increase in charge offs in was primarily related to the deterioration in the economy and its effect on the real estate market 
substandard loans that were not classified as non accrual were  at december  and  at december  the large increase in this category of loans related to substandard commercial loans as they increased  from  at december  to  at december  substandard mortgage loans totaled  and substandard installment loans were at december  these loans are reviewed at least quarterly by senior management

this watch list  together with a listing of all classified loans  nonaccrual loans and delinquent loans  is reviewed monthly by management and the board of directors 
additionally  the company evaluates its consumer and residential real estate loan pools for probable losses incurred based on historical trends  adjusted by current delinquency and non performing loan levels 
the company has both internal and external loan review personnel who annually review approximately of all loans 
external loan review personnel examine all commercial credit relationships over the ability to absorb loan losses promptly when problems are identified is invaluable to a banking organization 
most often  losses incurred as a result of prompt  aggressive collection actions are much lower than losses incurred after prolonged legal proceedings 
accordingly  the company observes the practice of quickly initiating stringent collection efforts in the early stages of loan delinquency 
during the latter part of  the company established a separate group to address its deteriorating credit quality 
this group consists of six full time equivalent employees and reports directly to the chief credit officer of the company 
at the present time  this group is charged with the task of efficiently resolving non performing credits and disposing of foreclosed properties 
during the fourth quarter of  the company realized a significant amount of loan charge offs 
approximately million of these charge offs related to collateral dependent loans where the value of the collateral no longer supported the value of the loan due to declines in collateral values since origination 
these charge offs will impact future calculations of the allowance for loan losses as the historical loss ratios will increase for the commercial loan homogeneous pools 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed at least quarterly 
the determination of the provision amount in any period is based upon management s continuing review and evaluation of loan loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  classified loans including non accrual and impaired loans  current economic conditions  the amount of loans presently outstanding  and the amount and composition of loan growth 
the company s allowance for loan losses was  or of total loans  at december  compared to  or of total loans  at the end of the largest increases in the allowance occurred in the commercial  residential real estate  and construction and development loans 
as the economy is still in the depth of the recession  home buying has virtually ceased  placing builders and developers in stressed financial condition 
borrowers have also been unable to continue to cash flow their business 
during the company purchased certain loans that were subject to the accounting treatment under asc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of acquisition  these loans had evidence of credit deterioration 
in applying this 
table of contents accounting standard  an allowance for loan losses was not carried over or established for these loans 
instead these loans are carried at their fair value at date of acquisition including consideration of expected cash flows to be received 
the valuation allowance for these purchased loans as of december  was before the adoption of asc  this valuation allowance would have been included in the allowance for loan losses balance 
had this amount been included in the allowance for loan losses amount at december   the allowance would have been  or of total loans

the average life of the company s investment securities portfolio was years at december  during the investment portfolio significantly increased in size as excess cash  a by product of loan run off and deposit growth  was invested in portfolio holdings 
spreads on investment products tightened as confidence grew in an economic recovery leading to lower overall investment rates 
the combination of these two events lower reinvestment rates and increased portfolio size caused the portfolio yield to decline 
the portfolio credit risk remained low and allowed the portfolio to avoid any credit losses 
throughout investment opportunities were focused on balancing shorter cash flow horizons and maximizing earnings potential 
entering the portfolio is well positioned to manage the eventual increase in rates and improved lending environment 

table of contents the company and its investment advisor monitor the securities portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for other than temporary impairment otti 
the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if an entity intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti shall be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti shall be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
sources of funds the company relies primarily on customer deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase repurchase agreements  along with shareholders equity to fund earning assets 
federal home loan bank fhlb advances are used to provide additional funding 
the company also attempts to obtain deposits through branch and whole bank acquisitions 
deposits generated within local markets provide the major source of funding for earning assets 
average total deposits were of total average earning assets for both and  respectively

another source of funding is the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company had fhlb advances of  outstanding at december  these advances have interest rates ranging from to see note to the consolidated financial statements for the maturity schedule of these advances 
the company averaged  in fhlb advances during compared to  during this decrease in the average balance of fhlb borrowings was primarily due to the increased deposits generated by the company which reduced the need for other funding sources

the company s core capital tier consists of common shareholders equity adjusted for unrealized gains or losses on available for sale afs securities plus limited amounts of trust preferred securities less goodwill and intangible assets 
total capital consists of core capital  certain debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   tier capital to average assets was 
total capital to risk weighted assets was 
both ratios exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies 
risk adjusted capital levels of the company s subsidiary bank also exceed regulatory definitions of well capitalized institutions 

table of contents the trust preferred securities which are classified as subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital or core capital with respect to the company under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
under such guidelines  capital received from the proceeds of the sale of these securities cannot constitute more than of the total tier capital of the company 
consequently  the amount of trust preferred securities in excess of the limitation constitutes tier capital  or supplementary capital  of the company 
as of december   all of the company s trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital 
common shareholders equity is impacted by the company s decision to categorize its securities portfolio as available for sale afs 
securities in this category are carried at fair value  and common shareholders equity is adjusted to reflect unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes 
the company declared and paid common dividends of

book value per common share decreased to at december  compared to at the end of the net adjustment for afs securities increased book value per share by 
at december  and increased book value per share by 
at december  depending on market conditions  the adjustment for afs securities can cause significant fluctuations in shareholders equity 
on january   the company entered into an agreement with the united states department of treasury the treasury department as part of the treasury department s capital purchase program 
under this agreement  the company issued to the treasury department  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares warrant shares of the company s common stock  at an initial per share exercise price of 
like stock options  the warrant issued through the capital purchase program is potentially dilutive 
the average stock price for the company for was per share and the warrant issued in has an exercise price of per share 
this results in no additional potentially dilutive shares during the preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and per year thereafter 
the company may  at its option and at any time  redeem the preferred stock for the liquidation amount of  per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
while the preferred stock is outstanding  the company may only pay dividends on common stock if all accrued and unpaid dividends for the preferred stock have been paid 
the company cannot increase its quarterly cash dividend above the level paid in october without the prior consent of treasury until the earlier of three years following the date of the sale of the preferred stock to the treasury or the date the preferred stock is no longer held by treasury 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company s participation in the capital purchase program 
liquidity liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs  measured in terms of lower yields on short term  more liquid earning assets and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities maturing within one year and money market instruments 
in addition  the company holds approximately  of afs securities maturing after one year  which can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
maintaining a relatively stable funding base  which is achieved by diversifying funding sources  supports liquidity  extends the contractual maturity of liabilities  and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs may arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources  funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans 
the company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits  which provide a sizable source of relatively stable low cost funds 
the company defines core deposits as all deposits except certificates of deposits greater than average core deposits funded approximately of total earning assets during and approximately in management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the bank incurs off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
off balance sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments  although material losses are not anticipated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the company s off balance sheet arrangements 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
the company monitors compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
these policies require estimates and assumptions 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
in management s opinion  some of these areas have a more significant impact than others on the company s financial reporting 
these areas currently include accounting for the allowance for loan losses  goodwill  income taxes  and mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay including the timing of future payments  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
goodwill accounting standards codification states that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  if any  are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
the company has selected june as its date for annual impairment testing  but will test more frequently if circumstances warrant 
during  the company determined that goodwill might be impaired and tested it for impairment at may  and november  see note in the financial statements for further discussion of the goodwill impairment charges for the year 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and the municipalities in which it operates 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities 
the company reviews income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets  and as new information becomes available  the balances are adjusted as appropriate 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  the company makes judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws and also makes estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
mortgage servicing rights the company originally records mortgage servicing rights at fair value and amortizes them over the period of the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans 
the servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to the carrying amount 
impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics  such as interest rate  loan type and investor type 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping  to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount 
new accounting matters see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of new accounting standards in 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee and boards of directors of the company and its subsidiary bank 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following tables provide an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to generally decrease in the event of a increase in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands 
as of december  the company s estimated npv would generally decrease in the event of a increase in prevailing rates and decrease in the event of an decrease in rates
