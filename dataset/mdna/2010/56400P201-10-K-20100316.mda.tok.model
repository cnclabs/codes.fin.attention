item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic products for diseases such as diabetes and cancer 
our lead product candidate  afrezza  is an ultra rapid acting insulin 
in march  we submitted an nda to the fda requesting approval of afrezza for the treatment of adults with type or type diabetes for the control of hyperglycemia 
the fda accepted our nda for filing in may on march   we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding the nda for afrezza 
a complete response letter is issued by the fda s center for drug evaluation and research when the review of a submitted file is completed and questions remain that preclude the approval of the nda in its current form 
as recommended by the fda  we will request an end of review meeting with the agency to discuss our approach for resolving the remaining issues 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to satisfy all of the fda s requirements with currently available data or that the fda will find our proposed approach acceptable 
the fda could also request that we conduct additional clinical trials to provide sufficient data for approval of the nda 
no assurances can be made that we will obtain approval of the nda in a timely manner or at all 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as of december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of billion and accumulated deficit in stockholders equity of million 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  if we are unable to obtain additional funding in the future  there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have held extensive discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies concerning a potential strategic business collaboration for afrezza 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we could conclude an agreement with a partner 
there can be no assurance that any such collaboration will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
we do not expect to record sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of afrezza 
we currently do not have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates  and we may not receive such approvals 
we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates 
we expect to make substantial expenditures and to incur additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the clinical development of afrezza and new inhalation systems for the treatment of diabetes  seek regulatory approval to sell afrezza in the united states and other markets  increase our manufacturing capacity for afrezza to meet our currently anticipated commercial production needs  expand our cancer research  discovery and development programs  expand our proprietary technosphere platform technology and develop additional applications for the pulmonary delivery of other drugs  and enter into sales and marketing collaborations with other companies  if available on commercially reasonable terms  or develop these capabilities ourselves 
our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  competition from other products and technologies and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 

table of contents research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist mainly of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval for marketing and for which no alternative future use has been identified 
this includes the salaries  benefits and stock based compensation of research and development personnel  raw materials  such as insulin purchases  laboratory supplies and materials  facility costs  costs for consultants and related contract research  licensing fees  and depreciation of laboratory equipment 
we track research and development costs by the type of cost incurred 
we partially offset research and development expenses with the recognition of estimated amounts receivable from the state of connecticut pursuant to a program under which we can exchange qualified research and development income tax credits for cash 
included in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were purchases of insulin totaling million 
our research and development staff conducts our internal research and development activities  which include research  product development  clinical development  manufacturing and related activities 
this staff is located in our facilities in valencia  california  paramus  new jersey  and danbury  connecticut 
we expense the majority of research and development costs as we incur them 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are focused primarily on advancing afrezza through regulatory filings 
based on the results of preclinical studies  we plan to develop additional applications of our technosphere technology 
additionally  we anticipate that we will continue to determine which research and development projects to pursue  and how much funding to direct to each project  on an ongoing basis  in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
we cannot be certain when any revenues from the commercialization of our products will commence 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates other than afrezza  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
the costs required to complete the development of afrezza will be largely dependent on the cost and efficiency of our manufacturing process and discussions with the fda regarding its requirements 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for administrative  finance  business development  human resources  legal and information systems support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional service fees and business insurance costs 
critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates of expenses such as stock option expenses and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in more detail below 
impairment of long lived assets assessing long lived assets for impairment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  
table of contents a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we believe our assets to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the useful lives of the assets 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  our reported results could materially change 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses  and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
clinical trial expenses our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contract with vendors  consultants  and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts 
our objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
we account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial 
we determine accrual estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials  or the services completed 
service provider status is then compared to the contractual obligated fee to be paid for such services 
during the course of a clinical trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of the services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc compensation stock compensation  previously fasb statement no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon the fair value of the awards at the grant date 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans 
accounting for income taxes we must make management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have established a valuation allowance of million against all of our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues during the year ended december  we recognized no revenue  and during the year ended december   we recognized  in revenue under a license agreement 
we do not anticipate sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of afrezza 
research and development expenses the following table provides a comparison of the research and development expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change clinical manufacturing research research and development tax credit stock based compensation expense research and development expenses the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to decreased costs associated with the clinical development of afrezza as we completed our pivotal afrezza trials during  including decreased raw material purchases and clinical supplies costs  offset by a loss on disposal of approximately million in manufacturing expense related to the abandonment of medtone specific assets  which would no longer be used as we pursue the commercialization of the next generation device 
the decrease in research expenses reflects reduced salary related and other research costs as a result of a reduction in force that we implemented in april we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in as a result of our obligation to purchase an increased amount of insulin as well as increased costs associated with the development of our commercial inhaler 
the research and development tax credit recognized for the years ended december  and partially offsets our research and development expenses 
the state of connecticut provides an opportunity to exchange certain research and development income tax credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for forgoing the carryforward of the research and development credits 
estimated amounts receivable under the program are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses 
during the years ended december  and  research and development expenses were offset by million and million  respectively  in connection with the program 
general and administrative expenses the following table provides a comparison of the general and administrative expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change salaries  employee related and other general expenses stock based compensation expense general and administrative expenses the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to decreased stock compensation expense and the purchase of 
table of contents patents from emisphere technologies  inc during the first quarter of  offset by increased professional fees related to the recently completed transaction with pfizer during the second quarter of and partnership efforts during the third quarter of we expect general and administrative expenses to remain effectively the same in interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances as we used cash to fund operating and capital expenditures 
interest expense for the year ended december  was related to the convertible notes issued in december and amortization of the debt issuance costs  partially offset by capitalized interest related to construction in progress 
interest expense for the year ended december  also included interest related to amounts borrowed under the loan agreement with our principal stockholder in december years ended december  and revenues during the year ended december  and  we recognized  and  respectively  in revenue under a license agreement

during the years ended december  and  research and development expenses were offset by million and million  respectively  in connection with the connecticut program to exchange certain research and development income tax credit carryforwards for cash 
general and administrative expenses the following table provides a comparison of the general and administrative expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change salaries  employee related and other general expenses stock based compensation expense general and administrative expenses 
table of contents the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to increased salary related expenses and consulting fees 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower cash balances as we used cash to fund operating and capital expenditures 
interest expense for the year ended december  was related to the convertible notes issued in december and amortization of the debt issuance costs  partially offset by capitalized interest related to construction in progress 
interest expense for the year ended december  also included interest related to amounts borrowed under the loan agreement with our principal stockholder in december liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities and borrowings under our related party loan 
in october  we entered into a loan arrangement with our principal stockholder allowing us to borrow up to a total of million 
on february   as a result of our principal stockholder being licensed as a finance lender under the california finance lenders law  the promissory note underlying the loan arrangement was revised to reflect the lender as the mann group llc  an entity controlled by our principal stockholder 
interest will accrue on each outstanding advance at a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum and will be payable quarterly in arrears 
principal repayment is due on december  at any time after january   the lender can require us to prepay up to million in advances that have been outstanding for at least months 
if the lender exercises this right  we will have until the earlier of days after the lender provides written notice or december  to prepay such advances 
the principal stockholder has agreed not to exercise his prepayment right if such prepayment would require the use of existing working capital resources to repay the loan 
in the event of a default  all unpaid principal and interest either becomes immediately due and payable or may be accelerated at the lender s option  and the interest rate will increase to the one year libor rate calculated on the date of the initial advance or in effect on the date of default  whichever is greater  plus per annum 
any borrowings under the loan arrangement will be unsecured 
the loan arrangement contains no financial covenants 
there are no warrants associated with the loan arrangement  nor are advances convertible into our common stock 
as of december   the amount borrowed and outstanding under the arrangement was million 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for our operations compared to using million for our operations in the year ended december  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   of which million consisted of non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation 
we expect our negative operating cash flow to continue at least until we obtain regulatory approval and achieve commercialization of afrezza 
we used million of cash in investing activities during the year ended december   compared to million for the years ended december  for the years ended december  and  million and million  respectively  were used to purchase machinery and equipment to expand our manufacturing operations and our quality systems that support clinical trials for afrezza 
our financing activities generated million of cash for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   cash from financing activities was primarily from the common stock offering completed in august and related party borrowings as well as the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities including a million certificate of deposit held as collateral for foreign exchange hedging instruments 
although we believe our existing cash resources  including the million remaining available under our loan arrangement with an entity controlled by our principal stockholder  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements into the first quarter of  we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations and if we are unable to do so  there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
accordingly  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital  either through the sale of equity and or debt securities  the entry into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company or the establishment of other 
table of contents funding facilities  in order to continue the development and commercialization of afrezza and other product candidates and to support our other ongoing activities 
we intend to use our capital resources to continue the development and commercialization of afrezza  if approved  and to develop additional applications for our proprietary technosphere platform technology 
in addition  portions of our capital resources will be devoted to expanding our other product development programs for the treatment of different types of cancers 
we are expending a portion of our capital to scale up our manufacturing capabilities in our danbury facilities 
we also intend to use our capital resources for general corporate purposes  which may include in licensing or acquiring additional technologies 
we have held extensive discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies concerning a potential strategic business collaboration for afrezza 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we could conclude an agreement with a partner 
there can be no assurance that any such collaboration will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we enter into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company  we would expect  as part of the transaction  to receive additional capital 
in addition  we expect to pursue the sale of equity and or debt securities  or the establishment of other funding facilities 
issuances of debt or additional equity could impact the rights of our existing stockholders  dilute the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders and may impose restrictions on our operations 
these restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
we also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing  sale or divestiture of certain intellectual property and other assets  including our technosphere technology platform 
there can be no assurance  however  that any strategic collaboration  sale of securities or sale or license of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to enter into agreements with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently  and any such agreements may not be on terms as commercially favorable to us 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
if planned operating results are not achieved or we are not successful in raising additional capital through equity or debt financing or entering a business collaboration  we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay  reduction or curtailment of our projects  including afrezza development activities  or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration  and there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments and contingencies our contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
future payments relate to operating lease obligations including facility leases executed in march and november  the senior convertible notes  and open purchase order and supply commitments consisted of the following at december  in thousands 
table of contents payments due in less than more than contractual obligations one year years years years total open purchase order and supply commitments senior convertible note obligations note payable to principal stockholder operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the amounts included in open purchase order and supply commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order or contract by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our clinical trials  the acquisition of manufacturing equipment  and commitments related to the expansion of our manufacturing plant and the purchase of raw materials under long term supply agreements 
the senior convertible note obligation amounts include future interest payments at a fixed rate of and payment of the notes in full upon maturity in the obligation for the note payable to the principal stockholder includes future principal and interest payments related to the million of borrowings as of december  interest is paid based on a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate on the date of advance plus and the principal payment is due on december  related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions see note related party transactions in the notes to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october of  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf consensus on eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and issued accounting standards update asu which amends the guidance in asc on multiple element revenue arrangements 
this guidance addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables and how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting  when applicable 
the asu is effective for fiscal year beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
adoptions of this guidance is expected to have a significant effect on how revenue arrangements entered into subsequent to january  are reflected in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates impacting our short term investment portfolio as well as the interest rate on our credit facility with an entity controlled by our principal stockholder 
the interest rate on our credit facility with our principal stockholder is a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum 
our current policy requires us to maintain a highly liquid short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market funds and investment grade corporate  government and municipal debt 
none of these investments is entered into for trading purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our short term investments at december  are comprised mainly of a certificate of deposit and a common stock investment 
we have entered into a foreign exchange hedging transaction as part of our risk management program 
we continue to utilize our million credit facility to fund operations 
as of december   the amount borrowed and outstanding under the credit facility was million 
the interest rate is fixed at the time of the draw 
if interest rates were to increase from levels at december  we could experience a higher level of interest expense than assumed in our current operating plan
