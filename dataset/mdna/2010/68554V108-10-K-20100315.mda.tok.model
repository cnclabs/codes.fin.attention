factors that could affect results are discussed more fully under the item a  entitled risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
although forward looking statements help to provide complete information about us  readers should keep in mind that forward looking statements may not be reliable 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
we undertake no duty to update any forward looking statements made herein after the date of this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview we operate primarily in the in vitro diagnostic business 
our business principally involves the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary oral fluid technologies  as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types  and other medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic products include tests which are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care and tests which are processed in a laboratory 
these products are sold in the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospitals  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
one of our products is sold in the otc or consumer retail market in north america  europe  central and south america  and australia 
in vitro diagnostic testing is the process of analyzing oral fluid  blood  urine and other bodily fluids or tissue for the presence of specific substances or markers for infectious diseases  drugs of abuse or other conditions 
however  we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests 
when combined with their ease of use  non invasive and dignified nature  and cost effectiveness  our oral fluid tests represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic marketplace 
we rely heavily on distributors to purchase and resell many of our products 
for example  genomma labs has exclusive rights to our wart removal product in the otc market in mexico  argentina  brazil  and various other central and south american countries and ssl has similar rights to our wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
we have contracted with several distributors to sell our oraquick advance hiv test to the us physician office market and our intercept and orasure product lines are sold by several laboratory distributors 
we also use distributors to sell our histofreezer product into the domestic and international physician office markets 
we expect to enter into additional distribution agreements for existing and future products in the us and internationally 
if our distributors are unable or unwilling to meet the minimum purchase commitments set forth in their agreements or otherwise substantially reduce the volume of their purchases  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials and on related products supplied by third parties 
this is particularly true for our oraquick advance hiv test  our orasure oral fluid collection device and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources or if the related products supplied by third parties become unavailable  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 

table of contents competitive and economic outlook competition in the market for hiv testing is intense and is expected to increase 
we believe that our principal competition will come from existing point of care rapid blood tests  laboratory based blood tests  and urine assays or other oral fluid based tests that may be developed 
our competitors include medical diagnostic companies and specialized biotechnology firms  as well as pharmaceutical companies with biotechnology divisions 
the current economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue for the foreseeable future and intensify  and could adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers 
these circumstances could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments 
these circumstances may also adversely impact the capital or funding available to our customers and suppliers  which  in turn  could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment  raw materials or components 
in addition  demand for our products by consumers may also be adversely affected by the economic downturn 
current financial results during the year ended december   our total revenues were million  which represents an increase from the same period in our net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  our net loss in included a million pre tax charge for the impairment of patents and product rights and a million pre tax charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 
our net loss in included a million pre tax payment received in connection with the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit and an income tax charge of million recorded to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
cash flow used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  an improvement of million compared to the million used in operating activities for the year ended december  as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  and more recent developments oraquick hcv test during the fourth quarter of  we received approval to affix the ce mark to our oraquick rapid hcv test 
ce mark approval is the first step required in order to allow us to sell our hcv test in the countries that make up the european union 
our hcv test is the first and only rapid hcv test bearing a ce mark that can be used with oral fluid 
we are currently pursuing certain additional registrations in specific european countries where required 
during the fourth quarter of  we filed a pma with the fda for our oraquick hcv test for use in the us professional market 
the application sought approval for use of the product with multiple specimen types  including venous whole blood  fingerstick whole blood and oral fluid 
the clinical study data submitted in the pma showed a high degree of correlation to a comparator assay conducted at a central laboratory 
during its review of the pma  the fda indicated that our clinical data could potentially have been affected by bias because the same operators performed the test and interpreted the results on multiple specimen types derived from the same patient 
the fda had previously reviewed and concurred with our original clinical trial protocol 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the fda concluded that additional clinical testing would be required to obtain approval of the pma for a venous whole blood claim  and that a new clinical study would be required for approval of claims for oral fluid and other sample types 
although we believe the clinical data 
table of contents originally submitted to the fda is sufficient to support approval of our pma  we agreed to conduct the additional clinical testing and study mandated by the fda in order to obtain approved claims for oral fluid  venous whole blood  and fingerstick whole blood 
in december  we filed a pma amendment with the fda which contains the additional clinical data requested for use of the test in detecting hcv antibodies in venous whole blood samples 
we continue to work on the additional clinical study required to obtain approval of the hcv test for use with oral fluid and fingerstick whole blood 
we expect this clinical study to be completed during the first half of oraquick hiv otc test in august  we submitted the results of our observed use study to the fda as part of our efforts to obtain approval for an oraquick rapid hiv otc test 
the observed use study was designed to assess an individual s ability to interact with the product packaging  comprehend the instructions for use  take the test and interpret the results while a trained professional observed those activities 
the observed use study was stopped after testing was completed for the first  subjects  because data from the study met the success criteria initially established in the study protocol for this phase of the trials 
during the second quarter of  the fda reviewed the data from the observed use study at a meeting of its senior management 
following this meeting  the fda contacted us and indicated that both the results of the observed use study and our remaining clinical activities should also be reviewed and approved by the blood products advisory committee bpac  an advisory committee to the fda  before proceeding 
in november  we attended a bpac meeting in which we reviewed the results of our ongoing clinical studies related to our hiv otc test 
we received feedback from the bpac which will be used to continue our efforts to seek fda approval of our hiv otc test 
oraquick hiv manufacturing during the second quarter of  we experienced difficulty manufacturing a component for our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test in accordance with our internal quality requirements 
a multi functional team was organized and worked aggressively with the assistance of outside consultants to resolve this manufacturing issue 
as the second quarter progressed  this manufacturing issue remained unresolved and our inventory levels became depleted 
as a result  we were required to allocate available product across our customer base and this resulted in a million order backlog at june  we provided some customers with free orasure oral fluid collection devices in order to help them meet their hiv testing needs during this period 
early in the third quarter of  we identified the root cause of the manufacturing issue and implemented corrective action 
we resumed full scale production of our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test  fulfilled the million backlog  and replenished our finished goods inventories for this product 
availability of hiv antigen and screening tests in past years  biom rieux  inc bmx manufactured and sold the only oral fluid hiv enzyme immunoassay screening test eia that had received fda approval for use in detecting hiv in an oral fluid specimen collected with our orasure collection device 
bmx also supplied the hiv antigen used to manufacture our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test and was the exclusive world wide distributor of that product 
bmx discontinued manufacturing their hiv eia screening test during and our agreement with bmx for the supply of hiv antigen terminated on december  as a result  we purchased a two year supply of the antigen from bmx as permitted under the agreement 
during the third quarter of  we made arrangements to purchase additional hiv antigen from a third party subcontractor that historically had been used by bmx to manufacture this product for resale to us by bmx 
we believe this subcontractor can supply our future requirements for the hiv antigen 

table of contents as previously disclosed  we had initially planned to conduct clinical trials and seek fda approval of an alternate hiv eia for use in testing oral fluid samples collected with our orasure collection device 
however  in mid we learned that  avioq inc  who had acquired a license from bmx to produce a new hiv eia test originally developed by bmx  obtained fda approval of this product for use with our orasure device 
as a result  we no longer intend to conduct our own clinical trials or seek fda approval for an alternate hiv eia  as originally planned 
substance abuse testing in january  we signed an agreement with roche diagnostics for the worldwide commercialization of homogeneous  fully automated oral fluid drugs of abuse assays with our intercept oral specimen collection device 
the oral fluid assays are being jointly developed under a development agreement previously executed with roche 
the oral fluid assays are designed to run on various clinical chemistry automated analyzers  which is intended to allow oral fluid samples to be processed with the same efficiency currently provided by fully automated  urine based drug tests 
the commercialization agreement is structured to take advantage of each party s respective distribution strengths  including our established market presence with oral fluid testing and roche s established base of analyzers and broad marketing capabilities 
settlement of patent infringement lawsuit in november  we settled a patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by inverness medical and church dwight that primarily targeted our oraquick advance hiv test 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  we paid inverness million 
we recorded million of the million payment as litigation settlement expense in our statement of operations 
the remaining million was recorded as prepaid royalties and will be expensed to cost of goods sold based on oraquick revenues through december  for additional information regarding the terms of this settlement  please see the section entitled  legal proceedings  in this annual report 
termination of royalty agreement in july  we entered into a termination and release agreement with the third party from whom we had previously purchased certain patents  trademarks  copyrights and technology related to our cryosurgical systems product line 
pursuant to this agreement  we made a one time payment of  in full consideration of the termination of the original asset purchase agreement we executed with this third party in june  and its related royalty obligations  which would have extended until december we recorded this payment  net of the royalties previously accrued  as prepaid royalties  which will be expensed in relation to cryosurgical revenues through december  termination of license and supply agreement in january  we entered into an agreement with the supplier of certain hiv peptides used in the manufacture of our oraquick hiv test 
this agreement was executed in connection with the supplier s bankruptcy and terminated our obligation to exclusively purchase peptides from the supplier and pay royalties on worldwide sales of our oraquick hiv tests 
pursuant to this agreement  we made a one time payment of million to the supplier in full consideration of the termination of the original agreement with this supplier and satisfaction of our royalty and purchase obligations 
we also received a fully paid up worldwide  non exclusive license to the supplier s patent rights related to the peptides 
we recorded the payment  net of royalties previously accrued  as prepaid royalties  which will be expensed in relation to oraquick sales through june  
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to december  total revenues increased to million in from million in increased sales in the infectious disease  cryosurgical systems and insurance risk assessment markets were partially offset by declines in sales of our substance abuse testing products and a reduction in licensing and product development revenues 
revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the impact of foreign currencies was not material to our operating results 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands  except generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues licensing and product development total revenues infectious disease testing market sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to million in  primarily as a result of our switch to a direct sales model for the us hospital market which allowed us to realize a higher average selling price for these customers 
higher volumes in the us public health market and higher international sales also contributed to the increase 
oraquick and orasure sales during totaled million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million in  respectively 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands  except during and year ended december  customers change direct to us public health hospital market international total oraquick revenues during  oraquick sales to the us public health market increased by as compared to this increase was caused by higher purchase volumes due in part to the fact that a number of our hospital customers are procuring oraquick product through public health channels in lieu of purchasing the test directly from us 
we believe this pattern is the result of increased public health support of testing initiatives by hospitals across the country 
as a result  sales to the hospital market are being redirected to the us public health market  thereby increasing revenues within that customer category 
we expect this trend to continue in 
table of contents sales into the hospital market increased to million during  compared to million in in january  we switched to a direct sales model for us hospitals as a result of the termination of our distribution agreement with abbott laboratories at the end of the increase in revenues in the hospital market is primarily due to a higher average selling price realized under our direct sales model 
international sales of our oraquick test increased to million in from million in this increase reflects higher sales into latin america  europe and asia 
sales into africa remained flat at million in both and we continue to see evidence that sales of our oraquick advance hiv test are negatively impacting sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device in the infectious disease testing market in the us during  sales of orasure declined  from million in to million in some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are electing to purchase our oraquick advance test 
we believe this is the result of customers recognizing the benefits of rapid hiv testing  especially with oral fluid  and the cdc s efforts to increase rapid hiv testing in healthcare settings 
while it is not possible at this time to estimate the ultimate impact of such ongoing change in purchasing patterns  we believe orasure sales will continue to decrease in substance abuse testing market sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased in primarily as a result of lower sales of our intercept collection devices and oral fluid assays 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and year ended december  change market workplace testing criminal justice international direct total intercept revenues our workplace testing business decreased from million in to million in pre employment drug screening represents over of our workplace testing business and the current recession in the domestic economy and high unemployment levels have had a significant negative impact on this part of our business  as well as on our direct sales to small and mid size companies 
revenues in our workplace testing business are not expected to increase until employment rates begin to improve 
sales to the criminal justice market decreased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the availability of competing lower priced drug testing products 
international sales of intercept devices and assays decreased to million in from million in  also as a result of competition from lower priced drug testing products outside of the us we do not expect renewed growth in intercept sales until employment conditions in the us recover and overall economic conditions improve 
in addition  the microplate oral fluid drug assays  which are sold for use with the intercept collection device  have come under increasing competitive pressure from home brew assays developed internally by our laboratory customers and compete with urine based homogeneous assays that are run on fully automated  random access analyzers 
we believe our competitors are developing oral fluid tests suitable for use on these fully automated homogeneous assay systems and these assays  if and when they are developed and commercialized  could represent a significant competitive threat to our oral fluid microplate business 
pursuant to a development agreement with roche diagnostics  homogenous fully automated oral fluid 
table of contents drugs of abuse assays are being developed for use with our intercept collection device 
the assays use roche s technology and will run on various automated analyzers to allow oral fluid samples to be processed with the same efficiency currently achieved with urine based drug tests 
we have also entered into a commercialization agreement with roche pursuant to which a drug testing system comprised of our intercept device and the newly developed homogenous assays will be marketed and sold on a worldwide basis 
cryosurgical systems market sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily caused by higher sales to our latin american otc distributor  genomma  partially offset by lower sales to our european otc distributor  ssl  and decreased histofreezer sales in international professional markets 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total cryosurgery revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and year ended december  change market professional domestic professional international otc domestic n a otc international total cryosurgical systems revenues sales to genomma for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to  during the year ended december  during  genomma reduced its purchases in response to an increase in product returns from retailers in mexico who overstocked during the winter months of throughout and early in  genomma worked through its excess inventory levels and resumed purchasing product during the second quarter of in addition  genomma launched our cryosurgical wart removal product in brazil and we completed our first shipment to brazil in september we expect sales to genomma to increase during the increased sales to latin america were partially offset by a decrease in sales to ssl 
sales to ssl were million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues from ssl resulted from a reduction in the transfer price paid by ssl and a decrease in units purchased as a result of increased competition in the wart removal market in europe 
we expect this increased competition to continue and sales to ssl to decline in during the first quarter of  we reentered the us otc cryosurgery marketplace through the launch of our own cryosurgical wart removal product under our new national brand  freeze n clear skin clinic 
commencing in february  we shipped product to one major retailer and we plan to expand distribution to other retailers in the future 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in revenues from freeze n clear skin clinic 
however  these revenues were offset by million in promotional rebates  advertising  slotting and return allowances provided to the retail trade  which we netted against the revenues in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe our participation in these promotional and advertising programs  which were executed and controlled by the retail trade  was necessary in order to increase initial awareness and implement the launch of our product within the otc market 
it is not possible to predict at this time how successful our new brand will perform in the domestic otc marketplace or whether we will need to participate in future retail promotional and advertising programs at comparable levels 

table of contents sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states were million in both and sales of histofreezer in the professional international market decreased to million in  as compared to million in the selling prices for our histofreezer product are lower in some foreign countries due to differences in the healthcare systems in those countries 
during and early  some distributors in these countries purchased english labeled histofreezer product and resold it into the domestic distribution network to distributors who employ alternate sourcing programs 
although we tried to aggressively address this diversion issue  we believe it negatively impacted sales in the domestic physicians office market during and may continue to do so until the supply of diverted product is exhausted 
the decline in histofreezer revenues in the professional international market in is largely due to a reduction of sales to distributors that we believe were diverting product to the us market 
in early  we signed agreements with two manufacturer s sales representative organizations to support sales of our histofreezer product in the us under these arrangements  over additional sale representatives will be working with our physicians office distributors throughout the united states 
the addition of these sale representatives is expected to contribute to domestic histofreezer sales growth in we see evidence that sales of otc cryosurgical products may reduce the number of individuals that will seek to obtain treatment of their warts by a physician  which in turn could negatively affect sales of our histofreezer product in the domestic professional market 
furthermore  in the european professional marketplace  there is increasing pressure to change or exclude healthcare reimbursement for certain treatment types  including treatments for common warts 
the reduction in or elimination of reimbursement for wart treatments could negatively affect international sales of our histofreezer product 
however  it is not possible at this time to estimate the likelihood or financial impact of these changes 
insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market increased from million in to million in  due to variations in laboratory ordering patterns and an increase in purchases of lower face value insurance policies for which insurers use our oral fluid screening device 
overall  we expect our revenues in this market will remain at levels comparable to those attained in licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues decreased to million in  from million in in january  we entered into a license and settlement agreement with merck co 
inc merck  formerly called schering plough in which merck agreed to pay us royalties on us sales of their freeze away tm otc cryosurgical wart removal product 
licensing revenues represent these royalties from merck in and we expect licensing and product development revenues to increase in  primarily due to the anticipated achievement of certain regulatory milestones under our international collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of a rapid hcv oral fluid test 
payments received from merck upon reaching the defined milestones will be recorded as licensing and product development revenues 
gross margin the company s gross margin was in  compared to in gross margin was favorably impacted during primarily by our switch in january to a direct sales model for our oraquick advance hiv test in the us hospital market 
also contributing to the increase was an improvement in manufacturing efficiency in 
table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of decreased clinical trial spending for our oraquick hiv otc test and oraquick hcv test 
the majority of the initial product development and clinical costs associated with the oraquick hcv device and related pma submission was incurred during a decrease in staffing costs resulting from organizational changes made during the fourth quarter of also contributed to the current period decrease 
expenses in also included a million patent license milestone payment required as a result of our filing of a pma submission with the fda for our oraquick hcv device  while expenses did not include any such payment 
we expect our research and development costs will increase in as we continue clinical trials for the hiv otc test and oraquick hcv product and develop other new products 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in staffing costs increased in as a result of hiring a new sales force in support of our direct sales model for the us hospital market  as well as hiring  compensation  and relocation costs associated with new senior level sales and marketing personnel 
market research and consulting expenses related to our cryosurgical products also increased during these increases were offset by a decrease in reimbursement of distributor advertising expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase from levels as we incur full year staffing expenses for the new senior level sales and marketing personnel hired in and we launch our oraquick hcv test in the european market 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased staffing costs as well as legal expenses associated with the patent infringement lawsuit related to our oraquick advance hiv test filed against us by inverness medical and church dwight  which was settled in the fourth quarter of we expect general and administrative expenses to remain at approximately levels as decreases in legal expenses are expected to be largely offset by increased consulting costs 
in november  we settled the patent infringement lawsuit filed by inverness and church dwight 
pursuant to the settlement we paid inverness million 
we recorded million of the million payment as litigation settlement expense in our statement of operations 
the remaining million was recorded as prepaid royalties and will be expensed in cost of goods sold in relation to oraquick revenues generated through december  in the first quarter of  we received a payment of million as a result of the settlement of patent infringement litigation we had previously filed against merck 
in response to a comment letter received from the sec dated august   we reclassified our patent litigation settlement of million received in january from other income in our statement of operations to a reduction of operating expenses 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to license payments for certain hcv patents  which we previously capitalized 
management s intent in capitalizing these payments was to utilize this license in certain developing countries for the marketing and sale of an existing rapid hcv test supplied by a third party manufacturer 
however  we were unable to penetrate this international marketplace with the third party s rapid hcv test 
furthermore  given the impact of the current global recession and the deteriorating status of certain third world economies  we no longer believed that we would be successful in selling a third party s rapid hcv test in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the remaining unamortized book value of the patent and product rights in the second quarter of 
table of contents other income expense interest expense increased to  in from  in interest income decreased to  in from million in primarily as a result of lower yields earned on our investment portfolio  lower investment balances  and an overall conservative  shorter term investment approach 
income taxes in november  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted 
this new law extends the carryback period for a net operating loss nol from two years up to a maximum of five years 
the carryback of the nol can be applied to both regular tax nols and alternative minimum tax amt nols 
the new law also eliminates the limitation on the use of any amt nols 
as a result of the elimination of the limitations  we have elected to carryback our amt nol to our   and tax years and apply for a refund of the amt taxes paid for those years 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  federal tax benefit associated with this amt nol carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a nominal amount of state income taxes 
during  we evaluated whether or not we would realize the benefits associated with our total net deferred tax asset in the future 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the current economic recession  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  which would result in a net cumulative three year loss  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax assets in the immediate future 
accordingly  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of in order to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
year ended december  compared to december  total revenues decreased to million in from million in increased sales in both the infectious disease and insurance risk assessment markets  together with an increase in licensing and product development revenues  were more than offset by declines in sales of our cryosurgical wart removal and substance abuse testing products 
revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of our international sales are transactions in us dollars 
as such  the impact of foreign currencies was not material to our operating results

year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues licensing and product development total revenues 
table of contents infectious disease testing market sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to million in  primarily as a result of the continued strong performance of our oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test in an increasingly competitive environment 
oraquick and orasure sales during totaled million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million in  respectively 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands  except during and year ended december  customers change direct to us public health abbott international samhsa cdc total oraquick revenues during  oraquick revenue derived from direct sales to the us public health market increased by as compared to this increase is the result of continued growth in our base business and from incremental sales driven by the cdc s efforts to increase hiv testing 
in september  the cdc awarded incremental funding to expand hiv testing and prevention programs in populations disproportionately affected by hiv  primarily african americans 
these funds were allocated to targeted state and public health agencies  for utilization during for the year ended december   sales to our former hospital distributor  abbott  decreased to million  as compared to million in this decrease was largely the result of abbott s ordering patterns  the impact of negotiations to end our distribution agreement at the end of  and increased competition in the hospital market 
revenues derived from the cdc and samhsa declined significantly in when compared to in  the cdc and samhsa placed bulk purchase orders directly with the company for oraquick advance devices and related testing materials  for further distribution to various public health entities 
however  both the cdc and samhsa did not place new bulk orders in and are not currently engaging in bulk procurement and distribution activities 
international sales of our oraquick test remained relatively flat at million in both and  with sales in africa contributing and million of those revenues in and  respectively 
during  sales of our orasure collection device declined  from million in to million in 
table of contents substance abuse testing market sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased in as the use of our intercept device for workplace testing was impacted by the continuing adverse economic conditions 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and year ended december  market change workplace testing criminal justice international direct total intercept revenues cryosurgical systems market sales to the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of a significant decline in sales of our domestic and international otc cryosurgical products when compared to the table below shows a breakdown of our total cryosurgery revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and year ended december  market change professional domestic professional international otc domestic otc international total cryosurgical systems revenues our domestic otc cryosurgical product was previously distributed in the united states and canada by prestige brands  owner of the compound w line of wart removal products 
our distribution agreement with prestige terminated on december   and as a result  no sales were made to prestige in or will be made in the future to this distributor 
sales to prestige were million in we have an agreement with ssl under which we manufacture and supply  and ssl distributes on an exclusive basis  our cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
the product is manufactured and sold under ssl s scholl and dr 
scholl trademarks 
sales to ssl were million and million in and  respectively 
the million sales decline in was due to lower than expected outsales by ssl in key markets outside the united kingdom  primarily resulting from intense competition from an already existing brand and new market entrants 
we have granted genomma labs exclusive distribution rights to our cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc markets in mexico  argentina  brazil  and various other central and south american countries 
sales to genomma labs were approximately  in and million in during  genomma labs reduced its purchases from us  in response to an increase in product returns from retailers in mexico who overstocked during the winter months of throughout  genomma worked to reduce its excess inventory position  and accordingly did not purchase additional product from us 

table of contents sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states decreased to million in  as compared to million in sales of histofreezer in the international market increased to million from million in on a combined basis  however  cryosurgical sales in the professional market declined in  as this business was affected by the diversion of some lower priced histofreezer product from international sources into the us professional market 
the selling prices for our histofreezer product are lower in some foreign countries due to differences in the healthcare systems in those countries 
during  some distributors in these countries purchased english labeled histofreezer product and resold it into the domestic distribution network to distributors who employ alternate sourcing programs 
we aggressively addressed this diversion issue by increasing our international pricing  changing product labeling and packaging  and enforcing contractual rights against certain international distributors 
insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of an increase in revenues associated with our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test 
at the end of  bmx discontinued the distribution of our western blot hiv confirmatory test and  as a result  in we began and are now selling this product directly to our laboratory customers 
licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues increased to million in  from million in in january  we entered into a license and settlement agreement with merck formerly  schering plough in which merck agreed to pay us royalties on us sales of its freeze away tm otc cryosurgical wart removal product 
pursuant to the terms of that agreement  during  we recorded million in royalty payments from merck 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of a rapid oral fluid test for the detection of antibodies to hcv 
during  we recognized million in revenues associated with funded research and development under this agreement 
gross margin the company s gross margin was in  compared to in our gross margin was negatively impacted by the significant decline in higher margin cryosurgical sales and by increases in manufacturing scrap and spoilage expense 
scrap expense increased from million in to million in although scrap and spoilage expense exceeded levels  oraquick scrap and spoilage was down sequentially in each quarter of  as we identified its root cause and made the appropriate adjustments 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of increased product and clinical development costs for our oraquick hcv test  costs associated with our continued efforts to obtain fda approval to sell our oraquick hiv test over the counter  and costs to develop our homogeneous fully automated drugs of abuse assays for use with our intercept oral fluid collection device in collaboration with roche diagnostics 
also included in our expense is a million patent license milestone payment required as a result of our filing of a premarket approval application with the fda for our oraquick hcv device 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of incremental salaries  benefits  and recruiting and relocation expenses related to hiring additional direct sales personnel for the hospital market  as we prepared to assume control of this distribution channel from abbott in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in distributor advertising and promotional costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower cash and stock compensation costs  bank charges  consulting fees and legal expenses 
as a result of the license and settlement agreement we entered into with merck to resolve our patent infringement litigation  we received a payment of million during the first quarter of other income expense interest expense decreased to  in from  in  as a result of lower outstanding debt balances and our election to fix the interest rate on our primary facilities advance at until its maturity in june interest income decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of lower yields earned on our investment portfolio  usage of some previously invested cash to fund inventory purchases  capital expenditures  and the stock repurchase program initiated during  and an overall conservative  shorter term investment approach 
in january  we sold our ownership interest in a privately held nonaffiliated company and recorded a million pre tax gain on the sale of this investment 
we purchase some of our cryosurgical products from  or utilize the services of  vendors located in the netherlands 
although the majority of our international sales are denominated in united states dollars  as a result of the weakness of the dollar in relation to the euro  we recorded a net loss on foreign currency transactions in the amount of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes during  we evaluated whether or not we would realize the benefits associated with our total net deferred tax asset in the future 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the current economic recession  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  which would result in a net cumulative three year loss  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax assets in the immediate future 
accordingly  in accordance with fasb accounting guidance  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of in order to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
during  we recorded provisions for federal and state income taxes of million  which reflect a effective tax rate 
our effective rate reflects the impact of permanent differences  generated by items which are not deductible on our income tax returns 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of  related to the inclusion of a federal research and development tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million at december  to million at december   primarily as a result of using  to fund operations  million for 
table of contents property and equipment purchases   for debt repayments   to buy back shares under our stock repurchase plan and  for the retirement of common stock to pay minimum tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares 
net cash used in operating activities was  in  resulting from our net loss of million and a reduced provision for scrap and spoilage of  for the year  partially offset by non cash charges of million associated with the impairment of the hcv patent rights  stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
also contributing to net cash used in operations were increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to the change in to a direct sales model in the us hospital market and an increase in hospital sales in the fourth quarter of when compared to prepaid expenses include million and  in prepaid royalties associated with payments made pursuant to our inverness settlement and the termination and release agreement related to our cryosurgical product line  respectively 
other current assets increased as a result of the  in refundable amt taxes recorded at the end of an additional use of cash during was related to a decrease in accounts payable of  offsetting these uses of cash during the year was a million decrease in inventory related to the utilization of a significant amount of cryosurgical raw material inventory for the latin america otc market and an increase in accrued expenses of  primarily related to increases in our year end management incentive bonus accrual and our royalty obligations 
net cash provided by investing activities during was million 
payments of million for additions to property and equipment  were offset by million of net proceeds from maturities and redemptions of short term investments 
during the year ending december   we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily to purchase additional equipment  upgrade certain older equipment and make improvements to our facilities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of  in loan principal repayments and  used for the withholding and retirement of common stock 
during the year  we also used  to purchase  shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan and we received  in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
at december   we had in place a  credit advance with comerica bank comerica 
pursuant to the terms of the advance  principal  and interest fixed at  are payable monthly through june  at which time the remaining unpaid principal balance is payable 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this advance 
on june   our  working capital line of credit with comerica expired 
we elected not to renew this working capital line of credit  since our facility advance matures in june and we had in excess of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available as of june  to fund our ongoing operations and capital needs 
all borrowings from comerica are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including present and future accounts receivable  chattel paper  contracts and contract rights  equipment and accessories  general intangibles  investments  instruments  inventories  and a mortgage on our three facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
the comerica agreement contains certain covenants that set forth minimum requirements for our quick ratio  liquidity  and tangible net worth 
we were in full compliance with all covenants at december  the agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends  to make certain investments  to incur additional indebtedness  to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets  and to merge or consolidate operations with an unaffiliated entity  without the consent of comerica 

table of contents at december   we had nol carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company retained independent tax specialists to perform an ownership change study and analysis to determine the annual limitation amount applicable to utilization of the nol carryforwards due to past ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we continue to review ownership changes on an annual basis 
we do not believe that ownership change limitations would impair our ability to utilize our nols against taxable income that we may generate in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated by these nols 
establishment of this valuation allowance does not change our view of the company s long term financial outlook or the expected utilization of our nol carryforwards 
the combination of our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is expected to be more than sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs through at least the end of our cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the cost of any future litigation  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of market launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the impact of the ongoing economic downturn and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  clinical trial accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers except for warranty returns and return rights granted to retail customers for our domestic cryosurgical wart removal product 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
for our cryosurgical product sold in the retail market  a provision for estimated product returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period in which the revenue is recognized 
in addition  revenue from retail sales is also recorded net of promotional  advertising  and slotting allowances granted to the retail trade 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
up front licensing fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the related license period 
product development revenues are recognized over the period in which the related product development efforts are performed 
amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
grant revenue is recognized as the related work is performed and costs are incurred 
we record shipping and handling charges billed to our customers as product revenue and the related expense as cost of products sold 
taxes assessed by governmental authorities  such as sales or value added taxes  are excluded from product revenues 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was approximately  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
the current economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue indefinitely and intensify  and could adversely affect 
table of contents the operations  cash flows and financial condition of our customers 
these circumstances may adversely impact the liquidity or financial position of our customers and could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of million  million and  respectively  as a result of quality  scrap and product expiration issues 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the fair value of equity based awards as compensation expense in our statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model s computations incorporate highly subjective assumptions  such as the expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of awards  after considering the effect of expected forfeitures  is then amortized  generally on a straight line basis  over the related vesting period of the award 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets had a net book value of million  or of our total assets  at december  property and equipment and patents and product rights are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of our assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to license payments for certain hcv patents  which were previously capitalized 
management s intent in capitalizing these payments was to utilize this license in certain developing countries for the marketing and sale of an existing rapid hcv test supplied by a third party manufacturer 
however  we were unable to penetrate this international marketplace with the third party s rapid hcv test 
furthermore  given the impact of the current global recession and the deteriorating status of certain third world economies  we no longer believed that we would be successful in selling a third party s rapid hcv test in the foreseeable future 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all remaining long lived and intangible assets at december  will exceed their book value 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended december  and any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of million 
the deferred tax assets  before a full valuation allowance  associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset  in order to determine if a valuation allowance should be recorded against it pursuant to fasb accounting guidance 
a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence to be considered when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance and this evidence is difficult to overcome 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the current economic recession  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  which would result in a net cumulative three year loss  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax asset in the immediate future 
accordingly  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our ability to use our nol carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal nol carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes had occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our future taxable income 
the company continues to review ownership changes on an annual basis 
clinical trial accruals 
some of our research and development is conducted by third parties  including contract research and development service providers 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the end of each quarter  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated service provided  we record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 

table of contents the majority of our assets is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and as a result we have little exposure to market risks associated with available for sale securities 
in january  we elected to fix the interest rate on our long term debt at until the debt s maturity in june as a result  we have no exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in europe and africa  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from foreign currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency were minimal compared to our total revenues for the year ended december  we do not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material to us in the near future
