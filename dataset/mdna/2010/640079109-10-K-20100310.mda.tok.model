table of contents overview of business we are a leading producer of premium fine papers and technical products 
we have two primary operations our fine paper business and our technical products business 
we also own approximately  acres of timberlands in nova scotia  canada the woodlands 
on march   we announced that neenah canada had signed a definitive agreement to sell the woodlands for c million million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  subsequent event 
in managing our businesses  we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets  responding effectively to competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing risks are important to long term success 
changes in input costs and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
market leadership 
achieving and maintaining market leadership through strong brands  product quality and performance  innovation and supply chain management is an important factor in our results 
our fine paper business  with its well known brands  has long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of world class premium writing  text and cover papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our technical products business is also recognized as a leading international supplier in the tape  filtration  component materials  graphics and identification and wall covering markets with products that meet unique and exacting customer requirements 
competitive environment 
our past results have been and our future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
in most of our markets  our businesses compete directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified 
our businesses also face competitive pressures from lower value products 
economic condition and input costs 
the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by economic conditions  including fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly for the euro 
rapid changes in input costs  particularly for pulp  latex and natural gas  also affect our results 
business segments our fine paper business is a leading producer of premium writing  text  cover and specialty papers used in corporate identity packages  corporate annual reports  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses  with sales to distributors and distributor owned paper stores accounting for more than two thirds of sales 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in appleton  neenah and whiting  wisconsin are among the most efficient in their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers in the product categories in which we compete 
our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation and other filter media  durable  saturated and coated base papers for a variety of end uses and nonwoven wall coverings 
we sell our technical products globally in product categories through five sbus 
we focus on categories where we believe we are  or can be  a market leader  which include  among others  the tape  abrasive  transportation and other filtration media  nonwoven wall coverings  medical packaging and image transfer technical products markets 
we are also a global supplier of materials used for customer specific applications in furniture  book covers and original equipment manufacturers products 
our customers are located in more than countries 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located in munising  michigan and near munich and frankfurt  germany 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations 

table of contents executive summary strategic initiatives since the spin off in  we have completed several initiatives that have allowed us to succeed in our strategy to transform the company into a more focused and larger premium fine paper and technical products company 
in  we divested our terrace bay pulp operations  acquired the german technical and specialty paper business of fibermark  inc and sold  acres of woodlands in nova scotia 
in  we purchased fox valley corporation and its subsidiary  fox river paper company  llc collectively  fox river to expand our fine paper business 
in june  neenah canada sold our remaining pulp mill located in pictou  nova scotia to northern pulp  which assumed responsibility for all of the assets and liabilities associated with operation of the mill 
we currently own approximately  acres of woodlands in nova scotia  canada the woodlands 
on march   we announced that neenah canada had signed a definitive agreement to sell the woodlands 
see note  subsequent event of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect the sale of the woodlands to result in a substantial gain 
the woodlands operation currently generates revenue through a stumpage agreement the stumpage agreement with northern pulp which allows them to harvest an average of approximately  metric tons of softwood timber annually from the woodlands at market prices 
the stumpage agreement will be terminated in conjunction with the sale of the woodlands 
for the years ended december   and  the results of the pictou mill and the woodlands are reported as discontinued operations 
results of continuing operations for the year ended december   consolidated net sales decreased approximately percent from the prior year to million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower volume in both businesses as a result of sharply reduced market demand following severe global economic weakness  particularly in the first half of the effect on demand of the global economic contraction was exacerbated in the first half of by a sharp decline in consumption for a number of key end use market segments  including advertising  financial institutions and the transportation and real estate segments and inventory destocking by our direct customers 
despite the lower volumes  consolidated operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million from the prior year 
operating results for the year ended december  include costs of million related to the closure of the ripon mill in may operating results for the year ended december   include a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and gains of approximately million from the sale of certain fox river assets and million from the settlement of certain terrace bay postretirement benefits 
excluding such items  consolidated operating income as adjusted in increased million from the prior year primarily due to reduced spending as a result of initiatives implemented to control operating costs and also lower manufacturing input costs 
these favorable factors were only partially offset by the effects of lower volume and reduced paper mill operating schedules 
results of discontinued operations for the year ended december   timber sales to northern pulp pursuant to the stumpage agreement resulted in net sales from discontinued operations of million 
net sales of discontinued operations for the year ended december  were million primarily from pulp sales at the pictou mill in the first six months of for the year ended december   pre tax income from discontinued operations was million 
for the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax loss from discontinued operations of million 
the pre tax loss in included non cash charges of million to write off the long lived assets of the pictou mill and a loss of million on disposal of the pictou mill 
income taxes in general  our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory tax rate of percent primarily due to the benefits of our corporate tax structure and the proportion of pre tax income in jurisdictions with marginal tax rates that differ from the us statutory tax rate 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit related to continuing operations of million which resulted in an effective income tax benefit rate of approximately percent 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision related to continuing operations of million which resulted in an effective income tax rate of approximately percent 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was also significantly affected by the non tax deductible nature of the goodwill impairment charge and an increase in the limitation on available tax benefits acquired in the fox river acquisition 
excluding such items  our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately percent 

table of contents for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was approximately percent 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was significantly affected by a reduction in german statutory income tax rates effective as of january  application of the new rates to our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities reduced our net deferred tax liabilities at december  the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities due to the benefit of the tax rate change resulted in an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  in accordance with asc topic excluding the impact of the german tax law amendment on our deferred tax liabilities and other tax adjustments  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately percent 
analysis of net sales years ended december   and the following table presents net sales by segment  expressed as a percentage of total net sales before intersegment eliminations year ended december  fine paper technical products total the following table presents our net sales by segment for the periods indicated years ended december  net sales fine paper technical products intersegment sales consolidated commentary year versus for the year ended change in net sales compared to the prior year december  change due to total change volume average net price currency fine paper technical products consolidated consolidated net sales of million for the year ended december  were million lower than the prior year primarily due to lower volumes 
in addition  results reflected unfavorable currency translation effects due to the weakening of the euro versus the us dollar 
net sales in our fine paper business of million decreased million or percent primarily due to a percent decrease in shipments 
we believe that we were able to improve our market share position based on the af pa report of a percent year over year industry decline in the premium writing  text and cover uncoated free sheet paper category 
lower sales volume reflected a sharp decline in consumption for a number of key end use market segments  including advertising  financial institutions and the transportation and real estate segments 
market demand began to decline in late and continued throughout the increase in average net price reflected the realization of price increases on branded and non branded products that were implemented in price increases of approximately three percent on branded products announced late in will not meaningfully impact results until 
table of contents net sales in our technical products business of million decreased million or percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in shipments 
lower sales volume reflected decreased demand in most markets due to weaker economic conditions and inventory destocking by our direct customers  particularly in the first half of sales were also lower as a result of unfavorable currency translation effects due to average euro us dollar exchange rates that were five percent lower in than in the prior year 
net sales were also adversely affected by lower selling prices for certain products in our european business  particularly tape and wall cover  which were influenced by currency factors for export prices and additional market capacity  respectively 
year versus for the year ended change in net sales compared to the prior year december  change due to total change volume average net price currency fine paper technical products intersegment sales consolidated consolidated net sales of million in the year ended december  were million lower than the prior year primarily due to lower volumes and a less favorable product mix in our fine paper business  partially offset by the realization of price increases and favorable currency translation effects due to the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
net sales in our fine paper business of million decreased million or percent primarily due to a percent decrease in shipments 
the lower volume was primarily due to an unusually large market decline in for premium uncoated free sheet papers as a result of weaker economic conditions  partially offset by incremental sales related to the acquisition of fox river in march the increase in average net price reflected higher selling prices for most products that were partially offset by a less favorable mix 
the less favorable mix was primarily due to the dilutive nature of the relatively lower priced grades acquired with fox river 
net sales in our technical products business of million decreased million or percent  primarily due to lower volumes for certain products that were partially offset by favorable currency effects and higher net prices 
average net prices increased approximately percent due to a more favorable mix and higher selling prices 
the mix improvement reflected an increased proportion of sales of higher priced products such as filtration and abrasives 
volumes declined primarily due to weaker economic conditions and lower export tape sales from germany as a result of the strengthening of the euro 
the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and is intended to provide a perspective of trends in our historical results year ended december  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income net restructuring costs goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge operating income loss interest expense net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations

we believe that by adjusting reported operating income loss to exclude the effects of these items  the resulting adjusted operating income are on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations 
we believe that investors gain additional perspective of underlying business trends and results by providing a measure of operating results that exclude certain gains and losses that are not expected to affect future consolidated or segment operating performance 
adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with gaap 
other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non gaap financial measures and  accordingly  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to their measures

our technical products business incurred an operating loss of million for the current year due to a non cash pre tax goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of million 
excluding the asset impairment charge in  operating income for our technical products business of million decreased million from the prior year primarily due to higher manufacturing input costs and lower volume 
the increase in manufacturing costs primarily reflected higher input prices for energy  pulp and latex and increased costs in germany following the start up of new and rebuilt assets 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by improved pricing and mix  improved manufacturing operations and the favorable translation impact from a stronger euro relative to the us dollar 
unallocated corporate expenses decreased million primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain employee benefit liabilities that we retained following the sale of our terrace bay pulp mill and due to decreased spending for other corporate expenses 
table of contents additional statement of operations commentary for the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense

the favorable comparison to the prior year was due to cash provided by decreased investments in working capital of million  including the receipt of a refund of us income taxes 
for the year ended december   cash used for increased investments in working capital was million 
for the year ended december   we received approximately million in refunds of us income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of us federal and million of us state nols that may be carried forward to offset future taxable income through 
table of contents cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was million lower than cash provided by operating activities in the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in cash used by operating activities of our discontinued pulp operations of approximately million  lower earnings excluding the effects of non cash items and increased investments in working capital in investing commentary for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  a decrease of million versus the prior year due to a reduction of million in capital spending 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities includes payments by neenah canada of approximately million to northern pulp in connection with the transfer of the pictou mill 
in addition  we paid approximately million in transaction costs 
such payments were more than offset by proceeds of million  primarily from the sale of certain fox river assets 
we have aggregate planned capital expenditures for of approximately million 
we believe that the level of our capital spending for is consistent with current economic conditions and will allow us to maintain the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing assets 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  a decrease of million versus the prior year 
the decrease in cash used was primarily due to spending of million for the acquisition of fox river in capital spending for the year ended december  was million compared to spending of million in the the reduction in capital spending is primarily due to expenditures in for major projects to increase capacity and improve efficiency at neenah germany and for capital spending related to our enterprise resource planning system 
financing commentary in november  we renewed and modified our bank credit agreement by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement the restated credit agreement 
the restated credit agreement consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility the new revolver and a million senior secured term loan the new term loan 
the restated credit agreement matures in november under certain conditions  the company has the ability to increase the size of the new revolver by up to million 
the total amount outstanding under the restated credit agreement cannot exceed million 
our liquidity requirements are provided by cash generated from operations  short and long term borrowings and proceeds from asset sales 
availability under the new revolver varies over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the new revolver  outstanding letters of credit of million and million of available credit 
in addition  we have million million  based on exchange rates at december  of available credit under a secured million revolving line of credit at neenah germany the german line of credit 
for the year ended december   net repayments on our new revolver and the german line of credit were million and million  respectively 
we repaid million on a previous term loan  including amounts repaid with proceeds from the new term loan 
in addition  we repaid million on a million construction financing agreement the german loan agreement 
we paid aggregate annual cash dividends of per share or approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents increased million 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million to purchase shares of common stock in connection with a reverse forward split of issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
our required debt payments through december  are million 
such payments include million to prepay the new term loan with proceeds from the sale of the woodlands  required amortization payments on the german loan agreement of approximately million and million on our german line of credit which we expect to renew in november 
table of contents on march   we announced that neenah canada had signed a definitive agreement to sell the woodlands for c million million 
proceeds from the sale will be used to repay the million new term loan in full and reduce the balance of revolving loans outstanding under our restated credit agreement to zero 
in addition  approximately million in contract termination payments related to the closure of the ripon mill will become due and payable upon the sale of the woodlands 
our ability to use proceeds in excess of amounts outstanding under the restated credit agreement is restricted to permitted uses as defined in the indenture for the senior notes 
the transaction is not expected to generate a cash tax liability because the tax basis for the woodlands is approximately equal to the sale price 
fees and other costs associated with the transaction are minimal 
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending and other cash needs for the next months 
our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies  control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  beyond in millions total minimum purchase commitments a long term debt payments interest payments on long term debt b other post employment benefit obligations c operating leases open purchase orders d contributions to pension trusts liability for uncertain tax positions total contractual obligations a the minimum purchase commitments in are primarily for natural gas contracts 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and minimum purchase commitments  based on historical operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
b interest payments on long term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at december  weighted average interest rates 
c the above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
d the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
established the asc as the source of authoritative us gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
sfas no 
supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all non sec accounting literature not included in the asc is non authoritative 
the company s adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on its financial position  results of operation or cash flows 

table of contents as of january   we adopted the enhanced required annual disclosures about plan assets in an employer s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan in asc topic such enhanced disclosures include  but are not limited to  investment allocation decisions  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
see note pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   we adopted the disclosure requirements of accounting standards update no 
which amends asc sub topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asu no 

asu no 
permits a reporting entity  as a practical expedient  to estimate the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share or its equivalent of the investment  if the net asset value per share of the investment or its equivalent is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of asc topic  financial services investment companies as of the reporting entity s measurement date 
the adoption of asu no 
did not have an effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
in general  our shipments are designated free on board shipping point and we recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are reported net of allowable discounts and estimated returns 
reserves for cash discounts  trade allowances and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using a weighted average cost method  or market 
the first in  first out value of us inventories valued on the lifo method was million and million at december  and  respectively and exceeded such lifo value by million and million  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
income taxes as of december   we have recorded aggregate deferred income tax assets of million related to temporary differences  and have established a valuation allowance against these deferred income tax assets of million 
as of december   our aggregate deferred income tax assets were million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and  our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was million and million  respectively 
in evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  we consider many factors which may result in periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

table of contents pension benefits substantially all active employees of our us paper operations participate in defined benefit pension plans and or defined contribution retirement plans 
in july  the financial services commission of ontario approved our request to settle our pension obligations for active employees and terminate the ontario  canada defined benefit pension plan the ontario plan 
in december  the ontario plan was terminated and all outstanding pension obligations were settled through the purchase of annuity contracts or lump sum payments pursuant to participant elections 
in conjunction with the sale of the pictou mill  northern pulp assumed responsibility for the nova scotia  canada defined benefit pension plan the nova scotia plan and other postretirement benefit obligations for active and retired employees of the mill 
the company accounted for the transfer of these liabilities as a settlement of postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to asc topic substantially all of neenah germany s employees participate in defined benefit plans designed to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement 
there is no legal or governmental obligation to fund neenah germany s benefit plans and as such the plans are currently unfunded 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as required by the pension protection act of subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for the year ended december   excludes a non cash  pre tax settlement loss of million due to the reclassification of deferred pension and other postretirement benefit adjustments related to the transfer of the nova scotia plan to northern pulp from accumulated other comprehensive income to loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
pension expense for the year ended december   includes million for losses related to the settlement of pension obligations for active employees in the ontario plan 
in addition  we recognized a reduction in pension expense of million related to an amendment to the fox river defined benefit pension plan to freeze the vested pension benefit for salaried employees born after december  pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that  on average  actively managed us pension plan assets will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about percent 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under asc topic the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in germany is generally based on the iboxx index of aa rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future pension obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents our consolidated pension expense in is based on the expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets and the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans at december  of approximately million increased approximately million from the fair value of about million at december   as investment gains and employer contributions exceeded benefit payments 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million which was approximately million smaller than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  in addition  we made direct benefit payments for unfunded supplemental retirement benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment asc topic  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity s reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a probability weighted discounted operating cash flow approach for a number of scenarios representing differing operating and economic assumptions 
we record an adjustment to goodwill for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of our annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic 
table of contents other intangible assets with finite lives acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  trade names and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to neenah germany was considered recoverable 
significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing  costs for manufacturing inputs  levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high  medium and low growth environments 
our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   indicated that the carrying value of neenah germany exceeded its estimated fair value 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax loss of million we did not recognize a tax benefit related to the non tax deductible loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill assigned to neenah germany over the estimated fair value of goodwill 
the impairment loss was primarily due to a substantial increase in the estimated cost of capital we used to calculate the present value of neenah germany s estimated future cash flows which resulted in a substantially lower estimated fair value 
the higher estimated cost of capital reflected market financial conditions at the time the annual impairment test was performed which indicated higher risk premiums for debt and equity 
as of december   a one percentage point increase in the estimate for our cost of capital used in the impairment test would result in an approximately million change in the estimated fair value of the neenah germany and a corresponding reduction in the implied value of goodwill but would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at november   indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable 
during our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment  we determined that certain trade names and customer based intangible assets were also impaired at december  for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of approximately million for the impairment of such assets 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 
asc topic also requires the reporting of excess tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock based awards as cash provided by financing activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our reported operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rates of the euro relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical percent decrease in the exchange rates of the euro relative to the u 
s dollar would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million 
we do not hedge our exposure to such exchange risk on reported operating results 

table of contents currency transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro 
we performed a sensitivity test to quantify the effects that possible changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar would have on pre tax comprehensive income based on the transactional exposure at december  the effect is calculated by multiplying our net monetary asset or liability position by a percent change in the exchange rate of the euro versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are as follows 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in net pre tax losses of approximately million 
finally  the translation of the balance sheets of our german operations from euros into us dollars also is sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our german operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta  a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our german operations by a percent change in the us euro exchange rates 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million 
the hypothetical decrease in uta is based on the difference between the december  exchange rate and the assumed exchange rate 
commodity risk pulp we purchase the wood pulp used to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over the price paid for our wood pulp purchases 
therefore  an increase in wood pulp prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on pulp purchases  a percent increase in the average market price for pulp approximately per ton would have increased our annual costs for pulp purchases by approximately million 
other manufacturing inputs we purchase a substantial portion of the other manufacturing inputs necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our costs for such manufacturing inputs 
therefore  an increase in other manufacturing inputs could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
while we believe that alternative sources of critical supplies would be available  an interruption in supply of either single source specialty grade latex or specialty softwood pulp to our technical products business could disrupt and eventually cause a shutdown of production of certain technical products 
we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising mill and approximately percent of the electrical energy at our bruckm hl and appleton mills 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate debt and our variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had million of fixed rate debt outstanding and million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not to fluctuations in our earnings or cash flows 
at december   the fair market value of our fixed rate debt was million based upon the quoted market price of the senior notes or rates currently available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate borrowings by approximately million 

table of contents we could in the future  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements  although those arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
environmental regulation climate change legislation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by us  germany and other international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  including potential future legislation to limit ghg emissions  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
