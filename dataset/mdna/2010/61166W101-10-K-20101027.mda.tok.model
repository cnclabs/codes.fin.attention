distribution of products we have a worldwide distribution and sales and marketing organization for our seeds and traits 
we sell our products under monsanto brands and license technology and genetic material to others for sale under their own brands 
through distributors  independent retailers and dealers  agricultural cooperatives  plant raisers  and agents  we market our dekalb  asgrow and deltapine branded germplasm to farmers in every agricultural region of the world 
in the united states  we market regional seed brands under our american seeds  llc and channel bio  llc businesses to farmers directly  as well as through dealers  agricultural cooperatives and agents 
in countries where they are approved for sale  we market and sell our trait technologies with our branded germplasm  pursuant to license agreements with our farmer customers 
in brazil and paraguay  we have implemented a point of delivery  grain based payment system 
we contract with grain handlers to collect applicable trait fees when farmers deliver their grain 
in addition to selling our products under our own brands  we license a broad package of germplasm and trait technologies to large and small seed companies in the united states and certain international markets 
those seed companies in turn market our trait technologies in their branded germplasm  they may also market our germplasm under their own brand name 
our vegetable seeds are marketed in more than countries through distributors  independent retailers and dealers  agricultural cooperatives  plant raisers and agents  as well as directly to farmers 
competition the global market for the products of our seeds and genomics segment is competitive and the competition has intensified 
both our row crops and our vegetable seed businesses compete with numerous multinational agrichemical and seed marketers globally and with hundreds of smaller companies regionally 
with the exception of competitors in our seminis and de ruiter vegetable seed business  most of our seed competitors are also licensees of our germplasm or biotechnology traits 
in certain countries  we also compete with government owned seed companies 
our biotechnology traits compete as a system with other practices  including the application of agricultural chemicals  and traits developed by other companies 
our weed and insect control systems compete with chemical and seed products produced by other agrichemical and seed marketers 
competition for the discovery of new traits based on biotechnology or genomics is likely to come from major global agrichemical companies  smaller biotechnology research companies and institutions  state funded programs  and academic institutions 
enabling technologies to enhance biotechnology trait development may also come from academic researchers and biotechnology research companies 
competitors using our technology outside of license terms and farmers who save seed from one year to the next in violation of license or other commercial terms also affect competitive conditions 
product performance in particular  crop vigor and yield for our row crops and quality for our vegetable seeds  customer support and service  intellectual property rights and protection  product availability and planning  and price are important elements of our market success in seeds 
in addition  distributor  retailer and farmer relationships are important in the united monsanto company form k states and many other countries 
the primary factors underlying the competitive success of traits are performance and commercial viability  timeliness of introduction  value compared with other practices and products  market coverage  service provided to distributors  retailers and farmers  governmental approvals  value capture  public acceptance  and environmental characteristics 
patents  trademarks  and licenses in the united states and many foreign countries  monsanto holds a broad business portfolio of patents  trademarks and licenses that provide intellectual property protection for its seeds and genomics related products and processes 
monsanto routinely obtains patents and or plant variety protection for its breeding technology  commercial varietal seed products  and for the parents of its commercial hybrid seed products 
monsanto also routinely obtains registrations for its commercial seed products in registration countries  as well as plant variety protection act certificates in the united states and equivalent plant breeders rights in other countries 
monsanto s insect protection traits including yieldgard corn borer in corn seed and bollgard trait in cotton seed are protected by patents in various countries that extend at least until  and yieldgard corn rootworm traits extend at least until having filed patent applications in and  monsanto anticipates that the bollgard ii product will be patent protected in the united states  and in other areas in which patent protection was sought  at least through monsanto s herbicide tolerant products roundup ready traits in soybean  corn  canola and cotton seeds are protected by us patents that extend at least until  and its second generation herbicide tolerant cotton  roundup ready flex  and soybean  roundup ready yield  are protected by us patents that extend until at least monsanto broadly licenses technology and patents to other parties 
for example  monsanto has licensed the roundup ready trait in soybean  corn  canola  and cotton seeds and the yieldgard traits in corn to a wide range of commercial entities and academic institutions 
monsanto also holds licenses from other parties relating to certain products and processes 
for example  monsanto has obtained licenses to certain technologies that it uses to produce roundup ready seeds and genuity smartstax corn 
these licenses generally last for the lifetime of the applicable patents 
monsanto owns trademark registrations and files trademark applications for the names and many of the designs used on its branded products around the world 
important company trademarks include roundup ready  bollgard  bollgard ii  yieldgard  genuity  roundup ready yield and smartstax for traits  acceleron for seed treatment products  dekalb  asgrow  deltapine  and vistive for row crop seeds  and seminis and de ruiter for vegetable seeds 
raw materials and energy resources in growing locations throughout the world  we produce directly or contract with third party growers for corn seed  soybean seed  vegetable seeds  cotton seed  canola seed and other seeds 
the availability and cost of seed depends primarily on seed yields  weather conditions  farmer contract terms  commodity prices  and global supply and demand 
we seek to manage commodity price fluctuations through the use of futures contracts and other hedging mechanisms 
where practicable  we attempt to minimize the weather risks by producing seed at multiple growing locations and under irrigated conditions 
our seeds and genomics segment also purchases the energy we need to process our seed  these energy purchases are managed in conjunction with our agricultural productivity segment 
agricultural productivity segment through our agricultural productivity segment  we manufacture roundup brand herbicides and other herbicides and provide lawn and garden herbicide products for the residential market 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a agricultural productivity segment the tabular information about net sales of roundup and other glyphosate based herbicides and other agricultural productivity products is incorporated monsanto company form k by reference herein 
major products applications major brands glyphosate based herbicides nonselective agricultural  industrial  ornamental and turf applications for weed control roundup selective herbicides control of preemergent annual grass and small seeded broadleaf weeds in corn and other crops harness for corn and cotton lawn and garden herbicides residential lawn and garden applications for weed control roundup distribution of products in some world areas we use the same distribution and sales and marketing organization for our crop protection products as for our seeds and traits 
in other world areas  we have separate distribution and sales and marketing organizations for our crop protection products 
we sell our crop protection products through distributors  independent retailers and dealers and agricultural cooperatives 
in some cases outside the united states  we sell such products directly to farmers 
we also sell certain of the chemical intermediates of our crop protection products to other major agricultural chemical producers  who then market their own branded products to farmers 
we market our lawn and garden herbicide products through the scotts miracle gro company 
competition our agricultural herbicide products have numerous major global manufacturing competitors who increased production at the same time that there has been an increase in the number of distributors packaging and selling generic glyphosate sourced from these suppliers 
the growth in supply and sellers has added to the competitiveness and margin erosion in the glyphosate industry and in certain regions has increased the channel inventory 
competition from local or regional companies may also be significant 
our lawn and garden business has fewer than five significant national competitors and a larger number of regional competitors in the united states 
the largest market for our lawn and garden herbicides is the united states 
competitive success in crop protection products depends on price  product performance  the scope of solutions offered to farmers  market coverage  product availability and planning  and the service provided to distributors  retailers and farmers 
our lawn and garden herbicides compete on product performance and the brand value associated with our trademark roundup 
for additional information on competition for our agricultural herbicides  see item md a outlook agricultural productivity  which is incorporated by reference herein 
patents  trademarks  licenses  franchises and concessions monsanto also relies on patent protection for the agricultural productivity segment of its business 
patents covering glyphosate  an active ingredient in roundup herbicides  have expired in the united states and all other countries 
however  some of the patents on monsanto glyphosate formulations and manufacturing processes in the united states and other countries extend beyond monsanto has obtained licenses to chemicals used to make harness herbicides and holds trademark registrations for the brands under which its chemistries are sold 
the most significant trademark in this segment is roundup 
monsanto holds directly or by assignment numerous phosphate leases issued on behalf of or granted by the us government  the state of idaho  and private parties 
none of these leases are material individually  but are significant in the aggregate because elemental phosphorus is a key raw material for the production of glyphosate based herbicides 
the phosphate leases have varying terms 
the leases obtained from the us government are of indefinite duration  subject to the modification of lease terms at year intervals 
monsanto company form k environmental matters our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
some of these laws restrict the amount and type of emissions that our operations can release into the environment 
other laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  usc et seq 
superfund  can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any former or current site owners or operators or any parties who sent waste to these sites  without regard to fault or to the lawfulness of the original disposal 
these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  they may become more stringent 
we are committed to long term environmental protection and compliance programs that reduce and monitor emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  and to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
although the costs of our compliance with environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty  such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position 
in addition to compliance obligations at our own manufacturing locations and off site disposal facilities  under the terms of our sept 
  separation agreement with pharmacia the separation agreement  we are required to indemnify pharmacia for any liability it may have for environmental remediation or other environmental responsibilities that are primarily related to pharmacia s former agricultural and chemicals businesses 
for information regarding certain environmental proceedings  see item legal proceedings 
see also information regarding remediation of waste disposal sites and reserves for remediation  appearing in note commitments and contingencies  which is incorporated herein by reference 
raw materials and energy resources we are a significant purchaser of basic and intermediate raw materials 
typically  we purchase major raw materials and energy through long term contracts with multiple suppliers 
certain important raw materials are supplied by a few major suppliers 
we expect the markets for our raw materials to remain balanced  though pricing will be cyclical with recovery of the global economy 
energy is available as required  but pricing is subject to market fluctuations 
we seek to manage commodity price fluctuations through the use of futures contracts and other hedging mechanisms 
our proprietary technology is used in various global locations to produce the catalysts used in various intermediate steps in the production of glyphosate 
we believe capacity is sufficient for our requirements and adequate safety stock inventory minimizes the risks associated with production outages 
we manufacture and purchase disodium iminodiacetic acid  a key ingredient in the production of glyphosate 
we manufacture our global supply of elemental phosphorus  a key raw material for the production of roundup herbicides 
we have multiple mineral rights which  subject to obtaining and maintaining appropriate mining permits  we believe will provide a long term supply of phosphate ore to meet our needs into the foreseeable future 
as part of the ongoing course of operating our phosphorus production  we are required to periodically permit new mining leases 
a new mine is currently in the process of being permitted with the us bureau of land management 
research and development monsanto s expenses for research and development were  million in   million in and million in in addition  we incurred charges of million in and million in for acquired in process research and development ipr d related to acquisitions

monsanto company form k employee relations as of aug 
  we employed about  regular employees worldwide and more than  temporary employees 
the number of temporary employees varies greatly during the year because of the seasonal nature of our business 
we believe that relations between monsanto and its employees are satisfactory 
customers although no single customer including affiliates represented more than percent of our consolidated worldwide net sales in  our three largest us agricultural distributors and their affiliates represented  in the aggregate  percent of our worldwide net sales and percent of our us net sales 
during  one major us distributor and its affiliates represented about percent of the worldwide net sales for our seeds and genomics segment  and about percent of the worldwide net sales for our agricultural productivity segment 
international operations see item a under the heading our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions  which could negatively affect our results of operations and profitability and note segment and geographic data  which are incorporated herein by reference 
approximately percent of monsanto s sales  including percent of our seeds and genomics segment s sales and percent of our agricultural productivity segment s sales  originated from our legal entities outside the united states during fiscal year segment and geographic data for information on segment and geographic data  see
