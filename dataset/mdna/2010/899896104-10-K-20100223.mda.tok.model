in  the company recorded an impairment to the nutrimetics tradename and goodwill of million 
these impairments resulted from benefits related to strategies implemented since the acquisition of these businesses in not occurring as quickly or significantly as had been projected

as noted above  the established markets showed a slight increase in local currency sales compared with among the established markets  france and austria showed significant improvement from larger and more active sales forces 
greece also contributed to the growth in established markets driven by successful recruiting programs and increased sales at the party 
these improvements were offset by a modest decrease in local currency sales in germany mainly due to a percent decrease in the average active sales force 
the markets in switzerland and the nordics also experienced declines in local currency sales in compared with  resulting from smaller and less productive sales forces

the australian dollar  brazilian real  and argentine and philippine pesos were the main currencies that led to the foreign exchange impact on sales comparison versus the higher segment profit was the result of improved results in central and south america  due to the higher sales volume  higher pricing in venezuela and value chain improvements in brazil 
in the first quarter of  the company began selling beauty products in brazil through its tupperware sales force rather than through the separate beauty business it had been operating  resulting in cost savings which improved overall segment profit 
a portion of the earnings in this segment have been generated in venezuela and translated to us dollars at the official exchange rate 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million pretax foreign exchange loss to convert venezuelan bolivars generated by the business to us dollars at a rate less favorable than the rate used to translate earnings 
the company also recorded million associated with remeasuring non venezuelan bolivar denominated balances at the end of as the company began translating on december   the venezuela operations at the parallel rate as further described below 
the venezuelan government has instituted controls that fix the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar and require approval of all exchanges at this official rate 
prior to  this official rate has remained steady over the last few years despite significant inflation 
the exemptions provided by venezuela s criminal exchange law for transactions in certain securities has resulted in the establishment of a legal indirect parallel market of foreign currency exchange  through which companies may obtain foreign currency without requesting it from the government 
the exchange rate in the parallel market parallel rate is variable and was about percent less favorable in when compared with the official rate 
the company has made applications to transfer funds at the official rate for the remittance of dividends and other purchases  however  due to the exchange controls in place and delays in the approval process  the company has not been successful in remitting these dividends at the official rate 
in light of the ongoing currency exchange control limitations in venezuela and the increasing cash balance in the company s venezuelan subsidiary reflecting its favorable operating cash flow  the company began to settle certain of its us dollar denominated liabilities with dollars obtained through the parallel market at an exchange rate less favorable than the official rate 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded the million pretax foreign exchange loss referred to above to convert venezuelan bolivars to us dollars at this parallel rate 
it is the company s expectation to continue to settle these us dollar denominated liabilities through the parallel market 
historically  the company has utilized the official rate for translation of its venezuelan subsidiary from the bolivar to the us dollar 
in december  the company considered its past and continued intent to use the parallel rate to settle its us dollar denominated liabilities and the fact that the company does not expect to be able to remit the dividends at the official rate 
in view of these facts and circumstances existing at the end of  the company determined that effective december   it would use the parallel rate to translate the operations of its venezuelan subsidiary 
as a result of this decision  the company recorded a pretax loss of million 
on january   the venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency and move to a two tier exchange structure 
although no official rules have yet been issued  the official exchange rate is expected to move from to for essential goods and for non essential goods and services 
tupperware s products are expected to fall into the non essential classification 
this change did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements for or the company s decision to use the parallel rate for translation purposes 

table of contents inflation in venezuela has been at relatively high levels over the past few years 
the company uses a blended index of the consumer price index and national consumer price index for determining highly inflationary status in venezuela 
this blended index reached cumulative three year inflation in excess of percent at november  and as such  the company will transition to highly inflationary status at the beginning of its fiscal year 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in earnings

in  the company had million of sales in venezuela  translated at the official exchange rate that existed throughout the year  and produced pretax profit in venezuela of million at that rate  before the million cost of converting bolivars to us dollars and remeasuring the year end balance sheet at the parallel rate as described above

the most significant causes of the increases in working capital  excluding the million negative impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies  were higher inventory  a higher cash balance and the payment of a non income tax liability during  partially offset by lower current deferred tax assets and higher accounts payable 
the higher inventory balance reflected  in part  restocking by the tupperware united states business following the december fire  along with building inventories in some fast growing business units in support of that growth and in some other cases inventory levels being higher than intended due to less than expected sell through to customers 
the higher cash balance in part reflected the generation of cash in china that had not yet been repatriated  along with a higher level of cash at the corporate level related to the management of credit capacity 
the non income tax liability paid in was for value added taxes in mexico 
the offset from a higher level of accounts payable largely reflected the management of cash flow at year end and the lower current deferred tax asset reflected adjustments made to an advance payment agreement entered into by the company with one of its foreign subsidiaries 
on september   the company entered into an million five year senior secured credit agreement consisting of a million revolving credit facility and million in term loans 
proceeds from the credit agreement were used to repay the company s previous credit agreement dated december  credit agreement  which was obtained in conjunction with the closing of the acquisition 
the credit agreement was then terminated

the agreement also requires additional principal payments consisting of percent of cash generated from certain asset sales  certain insurance proceeds and certain new debt issuances  as well as up to percent of excess cash flows 
excess cash flows are substantively defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  
table of contents required debt payments and actual dividends paid up to million annually 
however  the credit agreement provides that cash may be used to repurchase shares using proceeds from stock option exercises 
it also provides that repurchases beyond those from the use of option proceeds are excluded from certain of the financial covenant calculations if the leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement is and will remain below times and the other covenants in the agreement are met  which is currently the case 
the debt under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets  excluding real estate  and capital stock of its domestic subsidiaries plus a percent stock pledge of its significant foreign subsidiaries

the company expects to maintain compliance with its debt covenants for the next months and beyond  however  economic conditions  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  lower than foreseen sales and profit or the occurrence of other events discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere could cause noncompliance 
the company monitors the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents and diversifies its cash and cash equivalents among counterparties  which minimizes exposure to any one of these entities 
furthermore  the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates  and recent developments in the financial markets have increased the company s exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of its counterparties 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its working capital and capital spending needs and its current dividend 
this liquidity includes the portion of its year end cash and cash equivalents balance of million  cash flows from operating activities  and access to its million secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had million available under its revolving line of credit and million available under other uncommitted lines of credit 
the company has not experienced any limitations on its ability to access its committed facility 
the company s credit agreement required it to maintain at least percent of its outstanding borrowings at a fixed rate for a period of at least three years in the future 
beginning in december and 
table of contents january  the company effectively converted million of its floating rate borrowings to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps 
the swap agreements called for the company to receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor rate and pay a weighted average fixed rate of percent 
the swap agreements were scheduled to expire in through in order to maintain compliance with the three year requirement  in  the company terminated three swaps with a total notional value of million and purchased three new swaps with the same notional value that were to expire in following this action  all of the swaps were to expire in and a gain of million was realized on the termination of these agreements and was capitalized as a component of debt 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted above  in september the company entered into the credit agreement  replacing the credit agreement 
as a result  these swap arrangements were terminated in september resulting in a termination payment of million 
in connection with retiring the credit agreement  the million deferred gains on the previously terminated swaps were fully recognized and both amounts were included as a component of net interest expense for the year ended december  the company s two debt ratings agencies  standard and poor s and moody s  have both rated the company 
standard and poor s currently rates the corporate credit rating of the company bb and has assigned a stable outlook 
it currently has rated the company s credit agreement as bbb 
moody s assigns a rating of ba to the corporate family rating of the company and baa to the company s credit agreement 
moody s revised its outlook on the company s credit rating to positive from stable in january the company s major markets for its products  those in which million or more of its sales were generated  include australia  brazil  france  germany  indonesia  japan  malaysia singapore  mexico  the philippines  russia  south africa  the united states and venezuela 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these markets could adversely impact the company s ability to generate operating cash flows 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force  the success of new products and or promotional programs 
the debt to total capital ratio at the end of was percent compared with percent at the end of debt is defined as total debt and capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders equity 
the decrease in the debt to capital ratio compared to the end of was due to a decline in total debt reflecting the million in voluntary payments made by the company in also contributing to the improvement in the ratio was an increase in equity from the positive impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and the earnings  partially offset by dividends paid and share repurchases in excess of option proceeds received in on december   the company experienced a fire at its hemingway  sc facility  causing complete destruction of its main finished goods warehouse and its contents

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in in  the company received million to settle foreign currency hedge contracts  whereas in the company paid million related to these types of contracts 
also contributing to higher operating cash flows 
table of contents was the company s focus on inventory levels which resulted in an inflow of million in compared with an outflow of million in and an increase in the inflow from accounts payable and accrued liabilities  due largely to the payout in january of a non income tax amount in mexico that did not recur in finally  the net income amount included million more in pretax  non cash re engineering and impairment costs than net income 
partially offsetting the higher operating cash flows was a higher level of accounts receivable in  mainly reflecting higher sales volume in the last month of versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in from million in this decline reflected the million payment related to non income tax payables due in mexico as of the end of  and the payment of approximately million of such amounts on a more normal schedule in there was also the million in payments made in to settle foreign currency hedge contracts versus a small inflow from such contracts in this was offset by an increase in net income for compared with the most significant year over year variations in changes in assets and liabilities were outflows for inventory 
this resulted from the rebuilding of the inventory level of tupperware united states following the december warehouse fire  the need for higher inventory levels in several markets to support higher sales levels and in some markets a higher level of inventory than desired in light of a lower than expected sell through of products to customers 
net cash flow from operating activities was also impacted by the proceeds from insurance recoveries

dividends during  and  the company paid dividends of per share of common stock totaling million  million and million  respectively 
in october  the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend that was increased to per share from the per share that had been declared and paid each quarter since the company became public in while the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision made on a quarterly basis  in the absence of a significant event requiring cash and assuming the ability to continue to comply with its debt covenants  the company has no current expectation of altering the dividend level as projected cash flows from operating activities are expected to be sufficient to maintain the dividend without restricting the company s ability to finance its operations  make necessary investments in the future growth of the business or its near term debt repayment obligations 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its current dividend payout 
stock option exercises during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  related to the exercise of stock options 
the increase in stock option proceeds during and was due primarily to an increase in the company s stock price and the holder s decisions including the remaining time before the options year terms would have ended

as of december  the company s total gross unrecognized tax benefits were million 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next months based on the results of tax examinations  expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and additions due to ongoing transactions and activity 
however  the company is unable to estimate the impact of such events 
b capital commitments represent signed agreements as of december  on minor capital projects in process in the company s australia  brazil  india  south africa and venezuela units 
c the table excludes information on recurring purchases of inventory as these purchase orders are non binding  are generally consistent from year to year  and are short term in nature 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the implementation of the following critical accounting policies are the most significantly affected by its judgments and estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  for this risk the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand and selling price 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management or the estimate of selling prices of inventory on hand decreases  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
any change in valuation allowance amounts is reflected in the period in which the change occurs 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million against which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
of this total  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is primarily related to foreign tax credits and federal and state net operating losses that  other than for the amount for which a valuation allowance has been provided  are expected to be realized prior to 
table of contents expiration based upon future operating income generated from the united states businesses of tupperware and beauticontrol as well as foreign dividends and other foreign source income 
also  expected gains related to future land sale would result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
as of december  and december   the company s gross unrecognized tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that approximately million of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled million and million for and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a benefit of million to the provision related to interest and penalties from the reversals of certain accruals made in previous years 
during the year  the company s gross unrecognized tax benefit increased by million and related interest and penalties were increased by million as a result of identifying indemnified uncertain tax positions related to certain entities in mexico 
also during the year  the company reduced its liability by million and related interest and penalties were decreased by million as a result of a settlement of audits in germany and completion of a renewed advance pricing agreement in france 
as of the end of  the company classified million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability 
of the total current amount  million relates to the indemnified mexican liabilities 
the remaining amounts represent potential settlement within the next year  of individually insignificant income tax positions in multiple jurisdictions 
while the company does not expect any other material changes  it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the uncertain tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next months 
at this time the company is not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of unrecognized tax benefits or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items 
promotional and other accruals the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like the promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes occur in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual 
goodwill and intangible assets the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october  and the sara lee direct selling businesses in december the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second and third quarter of each year related to beauticontrol and the acquired units  respectively 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that leads the company to determine that a triggering event for impairment testing has occurred  a test is completed at that time 
the impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure for a goodwill impairment loss 
this step revalues all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to their current fair values and 
table of contents then compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the valuation of goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of beauticontrol s operations both in north america and internationally  and the operations of the acquired units businesses which include five individual reporting units 
fair value of the reporting units is determined by the company using either the income approach or a combination of the income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach percent 
the income approach  or discounted cash flow approach  requires significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows  including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates as to the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the most sensitive estimate in this evaluation is the projection of operating cash flows  as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
the company s cash flow model uses forecasts for periods of about years and a terminal value 
the significant assumptions for these forecasts include annual revenue growth rates  which ranged from percent to percent with an average growth rate of percent in the company s most recent modeling 
the growth rates are determined by reviewing historical results of these units and the historical results of other of the company s business units that are similar to those of the reporting units  along with the expected contribution from growth strategies implemented in the units 
terminal values for all reporting units have been calculated using a long term growth rate of percent 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  the company applied discount rates to its reporting units projected cash flows ranging from to percent in its most recent modeling 
the discount rate at the high end of this range was for the south african and latin american reporting units due to higher country specific risk 
the market approach relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar to tupperware and deriving a range of revenue and profit multiples 
the publicly traded companies used in the market approach have been selected based on their having similar product lines of consumer goods  beauty products and or companies using a direct selling distribution method 
the resulting multiples have been applied to the reporting unit to determine fair value 
the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and tradenames acquired in conjunction with its purchase of the sara lee direct selling businesses 
these assets have indefinite lives and are evaluated for impairment annually similarly to goodwill 
the fair value of the company s tradenames is determined using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
in this method  the value of the asset is calculated by selecting royalty rates  which estimate the amount a company would be willing to pay for the use of the asset 
these rates are applied to the company s projected revenue  tax affected and discounted to present value using an appropriate rate 
royalty rates used were selected by reviewing comparable trademark licensing agreements in the market  and a range from to percent was used in in estimating the fair value of the tradenames  the company also applied in a discount rate ranging from to percent  and revenue growth ranging from to percent  with an average growth rate of percent and a long term terminal growth rate of percent 
similar to the rates used in valuing the goodwill  the discount rates towards the high end of the range related to tradenames located in areas with higher country risks  such as revenue generated in the company s argentina  philippines  south africa and uruguay markets under the avroy shlain  fuller  swissgarde and nuvo tradenames 
as of september   the company completed the annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of the former sara lee direct selling reporting units 
as a result of this review  nutrimetics goodwill and tradename were deemed to be impaired  resulting in a total non cash impairment charge of million 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename and a million impairment to the naturcare tradename 
for the fiscal year  the company completed the review of goodwill for all reporting units and determined that there was no impairment after the write down of the tradename assets 
these prior impairments related to the company s nutrimetics and naturcare businesses  in part  due to the fact that current and forecasted future results of operations were below its prior projections 
this resulted from benefits related to strategies implemented since the acquisition of these 
table of contents businesses in not occurring as quickly or significantly as had been projected 
also contributing to the previous impairments was an overall increase to the assumed discount rates used in the valuations 
although some improvements had been made in these businesses  the rates of growth of sales  profit and cash flow of the nutrimetics and naturcare businesses in the second quarter of were below the company s projections used in its previous valuations  as was the forecast for growth in future periods 
in the second quarter of  the company also noted that financial results for the south african beauty business were not meeting the projections used in the valuation 
given the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in cash flows for these reporting units  the company performed interim impairment tests in the second quarter of of tradenames and reporting units  reducing future forecasts in these units to reflect recent performance including the impact of the external environment 
the result of the interim impairment tests was to record a million impairment to the nutrimetics tradename  a million impairment to the naturcare tradename and a million impairment to the avroy shlain tradename 
in addition to the impairment of tradenames  the company also recognized impairments of goodwill of million and million relating to the nutrimetics and south african beauty reporting units 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment tests for all of the reporting units and tradenames  other than beauticontrol  which was completed in the second quarter  noting no further impairment 
with the impairments recorded for the nutrimetics and south african reporting units  these units are at a higher risk of additional impairments in future periods if changes in certain assumptions occur 
this is also the case for the nutrimetics  avroy shlain and naturcare tradename values as in these cases the fair value was equal to carrying value when the impairment charges were recorded 
the fair value of the fuller mexico  naturcare and beauticontrol reporting units and the nuvo and swissgarde trade names exceeds the carrying value by over percent resulting in a lower risk that these assets could be impaired in future periods 
the fair value of the fuller tradename exceeds its carrying value by over percent making future impairments less likely to occur 
the company s fuller latin america reporting unit only shows an excess of percent over carrying value  which indicates a higher risk of future impairment 
this reporting unit has million of goodwill as of december  given the sensitivity of the valuation to changes in cash flow or market multiples  the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to the company s performance 
this could occur if there is a decrease in forecasted results or changes in interest rates or market characteristics including additional declines in valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
for instance  a basis point increase in the discount rate or a percent decrease in the overall cash flow assumptions could result in an additional impairment charge of about million  of which million would relate to nutrimetics 
further impairment charges would have an adverse impact on the company s net income and could result in a lack of compliance with the company s debt covenants  although the financial covenant directly affected is the minimum net worth requirement and the first million of any impairments  net of tax  arising from july  forward is excluded from the calculation of compliance with this covenant 
since july   the company has recognized cumulative impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets of million  net of tax 
further  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   the company had net worth as defined by its credit agreement that was million more than the required net worth 
additionally  as of december  the company had million included on its consolidated balance sheet as the value of the acquired units sales forces 
the estimated annual amortization expense associated with these intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the product formulation asset recorded as part of the acquisition was fully amortized 
retirement obligations pensions the company records pension costs and the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans using the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this guidance 
table of contents requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the measurement of the retirement obligations and costs of providing benefits under the company s pension plans involves various facts  including several assumptions 
the company believes the most critical of these assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate and government bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
the discount rate assumptions used to determine pension expense for the company s us and foreign plans was as follows discount rate us plans foreign plans the company has established strategic asset allocation percentage targets for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return 
the company periodically revises asset allocations  where appropriate  in an effort to improve return and manage risk 
the estimated rate of return is based on long term expectations given current investment objectives and historical results 
the expected rate of return assumption used by the company for its us and foreign plans were as follows expected rate of return us plans foreign plans the following table highlights the potential impact on the company s pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company s pension plans  based on assets and liabilities at december  in millions impact on pension expense discount rate change by basis points expected rate of return on plan assets change by basis points other post retirement benefits the company accounts for its post retirement benefit plan in accordance applicable accounting guidance  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination requires the selection of various assumptions  including a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate primarily by reference to rates of high quality  long term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the expected payments to be made under the plans 
high quality corporate bonds were determined to be bonds with a credit rating of aa or better by standards and poor s and aa or better by moody s 
the discount rate assumptions used by the company to determine other post retirement benefit expense were percent  percent and percent for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
a change in discount rate of basis points would not be material 
the following are the assumed health care cost trend rates used by the company health care trend rates initial health care cost trend ultimate health care cost trend year ultimate trend rate achieved 
table of contents the healthcare cost trend rate assumption may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on post retirement benefit obligation revenue recognition revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers  the price is fixed  the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who  in most cases  is one of the company s independent distributors or a member of its independent sales force and when collection is reasonably assured 
when revenue is recorded  estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue 
discounts earned based on promotional programs in place  volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of assumptions  including the estimated length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term 
furthermore  in calculating compensation expense for these awards  the company is also required to approximate the number of options that will be forfeited prior to completing their vesting requirement forfeitures 
many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings  interest rate swaps  and the currencies in which it borrows 
the company has previously set a target  over time  of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
as discussed earlier  the company s borrowings under its current credit agreement carry a variable interest rate  but the agreement requires the company to maintain a fixed interest rate on at least percent of total debt during the term of the loan  which is consistent with the terms of the company s previous credit agreement 
in september  the company entered into four interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling million that expire in under the terms of these swap agreements  the company will receive a floating rate equal to the month us dollar libor and pay a weighted average fixed rate of about percent 

table of contents during  the company entered into forward interest rate agreements that swap the company s libor based floating obligation into a fixed obligation for million for and million for the company paid a weighted average rate of about percent on the million for and will pay percent on the million for  plus the spread under the credit agreement  which was basis points as of december  the above interest rate swaps entered into in and  effectively fixed the interest rates on the entire outstanding debt balance 
the company does pay a variable rate on its libor based revolver borrowings  although if short term interest rates varied by percent with all other variables remaining constant  the company s annual interest expense would not be significantly impacted 
a significant portion of the company s sales and profit comes from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments  and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of the company s international operations 
the company is not able to project in any meaningful way the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
the company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales  profit or cash flow generated by its operations 
while the company s hedges of its equity in its foreign subsidiaries and its fair value hedges of balance sheet risks all work together to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses  they result in an impact to operating cash flows as they are settled 
for the year ended december   the cash flow impact of these currency hedges was an inflow of million  while in it was an outflow of million 
the us dollar equivalent of the company s most significant net open hedge positions as of december  were to sell mexican pesos million  swiss francs million  and polish zloty million and to buy us dollars million  malaysian ringgit million  and euro million 
in agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  for example  an appreciating dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the company at settlement with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for us dollars 
the above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the company s outstanding currency exposures 
based on rates existing as of december   the company was in a net payable position of approximately million related to its currency hedges  which upon settlement could have a significant impact on the company s cash flow 
the company records the impact of forward points in net interest expense 
a precise calculation of the impact of currency fluctuations is not practical since some of the contracts are between non us dollar currencies 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may 
table of contents enter into additional contracts to hedge exposure in the future 
see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities for foreign currency in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations 
the risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the determination of fair value for the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
the company continues to closely monitor its counterparties and will take action  as appropriate and possible  to further manage its counterparty credit risk 
the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and in particular the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of most tupperware products and the company currently estimates that it will include in cost of sales about million for the cost of resin in the tupperware brand products it produces 
the company uses many different kinds of resins in its products 
about two thirds of its resins are polyolefins simple chemical structure  easily refined from oil  and as such the price of these is strongly affected by the underlying price of oil 
the remaining one third of its resins are more highly engineered  where the price of oil plays a less direct role in determining price 
with a comparable product mix  a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin would impact the company s annual cost of sales by about million compared with the prior year 
for  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produced was positively impacted by about million in local currency due to resin cost changes as compared with for the full year of  the company estimates its cost of sales of the tupperware products it produces will be negatively impacted by about million on a local currency basis due to resin cost changes as compared with the company partially manages this risk by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation in each market  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of current favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering into forward contracts for resin prices is not practical or cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future 
the company s program to sell land held for development is also exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process 
included among these risks are the ability to obtain all government approvals  the success of buyers in attracting tenants for commercial or residential developments in the orlando real estate market or obtaining financing and general economic conditions  such as interest rate increases 
the company s land sale program has been negatively impacted by the drivers and ramifications of the credit crisis and real estate market conditions in the united states which has delayed the completion of this program
