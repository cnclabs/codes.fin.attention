item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of semiconductor solutions in the growing broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
our products include power amplifiers  tuner integrated circuits  active splitters  line amplifiers and other components  which can be sold individually or packaged as integrated radio frequency and front end modules 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the high growth voice  data and video segments of the broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
we offer g products that use the w cdma  edge and wedge standards  g products that use hspa and evdo standards  g products for wimax and lte  wifi products that use the a b g and n mimo standards  catv cable modem and set top box products  catv infrastructure products and fttp products 
our business strategy focuses on developing rf front end solutions for our customers and partnering with industry leading wireless and wireline chipset providers to incorporate our solutions into their reference designs 
our integrated solutions enable our customers to improve rf performance  power efficiency  reliability  time to market and the integration of chip components into single packages  while reducing the size  weight and cost of their products 
we continue to focus on leveraging our technological advantages to remain a leading supplier of innovative semiconductor solutions for broadband wireless and wireline communications 
we believe our patented ingap plus technology  which combines the bipolar technology of a pa hbt pa with the surface device technology of an rf active switch phemt on the same die  provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
additionally  we believe technologies such as help provide our customers a competitive advantage by enabling their g  g and g devices to consume less battery power and deliver longer talk time than comparable products in their markets 
our six inch diameter gaas fab located at our corporate headquarters in warren  new jersey  has been operational since during  we announced a hybrid manufacturing strategy whereby we entered into a strategic foundry agreement with win semiconductors to supplement our existing wafer fabrication capability and allow for additional and flexible capacity without the requisite capital investment 
our annual revenues declined from  as a result of a combination of a reduction in market share with certain customers and an industry slowdown due to the current macroeconomic environment 
although our annual revenue declined in  we experienced sequential growth in quarterly revenue commencing with the second quarter of we believe our markets are  and will continue to remain  competitive which could result in continued quarterly volatility in our net sales 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected over the long term to continue to result in competitive or declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies significant estimates general we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when title to the products is transferred to the customer  which occurs upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the sales order 
we sell to certain distributors who are granted limited contractual rights of return and exchange and certain pre negotiated individual product customer price protection 
revenue from sales of our products to distributors is recognized  net of allowances  upon shipment of the products to the distributors 
at the time of shipment  title transfers to the distributors and payment from the distributors is due on our standard commercial terms  payment terms are not contingent upon resale of the products 
revenue is appropriately reduced for the portion of shipments subject to return  exchange or price protection 
allowances for the distributors are recorded upon shipment and calculated based on the distributors indicated intent  historical data  current economic conditions and contractual terms 
we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner 
we charge customers for the costs of certain contractually committed inventories that remain at the end of a product s life 
such amounts are recognized as cancellation revenue when cash is received 
the value of the inventory related to cancellation revenue may  in some instances  have been reserved during prior periods in accordance with our inventory obsolescence policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to erode  making them unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining historical returns and other information deemed critical and provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold 
the liability for warranty costs is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with accounting standards codification asc stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which in most cases is the vesting period 
determining the fair value of certain awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free interest rate 
our expected volatility is based on historical and implied volatility 
the expected term of the stock options is based on several factors including historical observations of employee exercise patterns and expectations of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security with an equivalent remaining term 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
marketable securities available for sale securities are stated at fair value  as determined by quoted market prices or  as needed  independent valuation models  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss 
independent valuations developed to estimate the fair value of illiquid auction rate securities ars were determined using a combination of two calculations a discounted cash flow model  where the expected cash flows of the ars are discounted to the present value using a yield that incorporates compensation for illiquidity  and a market comparables method  where the ars are valued based on indications  from the secondary market  of what discounts buyers demand when purchasing similar ars 
the valuations include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security  expected cash flows  discount rates  credit ratings  workout periods and overall capital market liquidity 
we review our investments on an ongoing basis for indications of possible impairment  and if an impairment is identified  we determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary  in which case it is recorded as a charge to income 
determination of whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary requires significant judgment 
unrealized losses are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the primary factors we consider in classifying the impairment are the extent to which and period of time that the fair value of each investment has declined below its cost basis 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
we capitalize production overhead costs to inventory on the basis of normal capacity of the production facility and in periods of abnormally low utilization we charge the related expenses as a period cost in the statement of operations 
in addition to lcm limitations  we reserve against inventory items for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted short term demand for the product 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in the event we sell inventory that had been covered by a specific inventory reserve  the sale is recorded at the actual selling price and the related cost of goods sold at the full inventory cost  net of the reserve 
long lived assets long lived assets is primarily comprised of fixed assets 
we regularly review these assets for indicators of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of use of the assets  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
an impairment occurs when the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of such assets 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying values of assets not recoverable through future cash flows are reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent management s best estimates based on industry trends  and market rates and transactions 
in connection with completing step two of our goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of  we assessed the fair values of our related intangible assets  consisting principally of assembled workforce related to the wifi reporting unit and expensed such value as an impairment charge in the statement of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our future options with regard to our investment in constructing a wafer fabrication facility in kunshan china and subsequently estimated and evaluated future cashflows associated with this investment 
such estimates included significant assumptions on possible recoveries through a sale of the facility  further investment  and a return in demand for production capacity and discount rate 
after evaluating the discounted cash flows  we fully impaired the investment and charged such amounts within restructuring and impairment charges in our statement of operations 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
management considers sensitivities to capacity  utilization and technological developments in making its assumptions of fair value 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
during  we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  and an adjustment to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was charged to income 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expense selling and administrative expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating loss income interest income interest expense other expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales decline resulted from a combination of a reduction in market share with certain customers and an industry slowdown due to the unfavorable macroeconomic environment 
net sales for the year ended december  of the company s wireless products decreased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased demand in both the cdma and edge wedge cellular device markets resulting from a reduction in market share with certain customers and an industry slowdown due to the unfavorable macroeconomic environment 
net sales for the year ended december  of the company s broadband products decreased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased demand for wlan pas shipped into the pc notebook market resulting from the combination of a reduction in market share with one of our key customers and general softness in demand for wlan pas that has occurred due to the unfavorable macroeconomic environment 
to a lesser degree  decreased demand in the set top box and cable infrastructure markets contributed to the lower sales for the year ended december  gross margin 
gross margin for declined to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
gross margin for included charges of million  representing of revenue  arising from a settlement of a commercial dispute with a customer and certain inventory reserve charges 
gross margin for included charges of million  representing of revenue  associated with production equipment purchase cancelation charges  equipment impairment charges and inventory reserve charges  which the company considered an anomaly of the period 
after considering the charges outlined above  the decrease in gross margin were primarily due to lower product shipments and wafer production  and fixed production costs increasing as a percent of lower revenues 
fixed production costs include  but are not limited to depreciation  maintenance and operations support functions 
research development 
company sponsored research and development r d expenses decreased during to million from million during the decrease was primarily due to decreased headcount and related materials used in our r d product and process development following workforce reductions in late and early selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses decreased during to million from million in in  selling and administrative expenses included million associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer  including million of stock based compensation upon accelerated vesting of certain equity awards 
the remaining decrease in was primarily driven by lower headcount and operating expenses following workforce reductions in late and early restructuring and impairment charges 
during the first quarter of we implemented workforce reductions  which eliminated approximately positions  resulting in a restructuring charge of million principally for severance and related benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented workforce reductions which eliminated approximately positions resulting in a restructuring charge of million  principally for severance and related benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated alternatives with regard to our investment in the construction of a wafer fabrication facility in kunshan china in light of surplus industry production capacity  reduced demand experienced by the company  as well as the broader macroeconomic environment 
we determined that the carrying amount of the china fabrication building was not recoverable as the carrying amount was greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and disposition of these assets 
as a result of this impairment analysis  we recorded a full million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in  our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the fair value of the wifi reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  and thus we performed step two of the impairment test 
our step two analysis resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill and therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  representing a write off of the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
in connection with our goodwill impairment analysis  we also assessed the fair values of our related intangible assets  which carried an unamortized value of million consisting principally of assembled workforce related to the wifi reporting unit noting it was similarly impaired and charged the remaining unamortized carrying value to restructuring and impairment charges 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates  as we maintained liquidity in government backed investments  and were compounded by lower average funds invested 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the interest expense principally arose from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in october notes which matured on october  other income expense 
other income expense primarily results from valuation activity in marketable securities we hold 
other expense is primarily comprised of other than temporary declines in value on certain auction rate securities and a corporate debt security held by the company of million and million in and  respectively 
the aforementioned other than temporary declines were net of million and million of income recorded on par value redemption recoveries in and  respectively 
benefit from income taxes 
the housing and economic recovery act of included the partial refund of certain carried forward research and experimental r e tax credits 
during the third quarter of  the company finalized and filed the r e claim as part of its federal tax return and subsequently received cash of million for the r e credits 
such refund was recorded as a benefit from income taxes 
compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for wireless third generation technologies or g  most significantly wcdma 
net sales for the year ended december  for the company s wireless products increased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for power amplifiers for g applications of million or  most significantly in wcdma applications 
the growth in g was partially offset by lower net sales in power amplifiers for gsm of million or  which resulted from the company s shift in market focus to g technologies 
net sales for the year ended december  for the company s broadband products increased to million or compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was due to increased demand for integrated circuits used in cable set top boxes of million or partly offset by a decline in cable infrastructure and wifi applications of million or 
gross margin 
gross margin for declined to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin was impacted by million in charges principally comprised of production equipment purchase cancelation charges of million  impairment charges on equipment held for sale of million and million of inventory reserve charges on dedicated inventory which was surplus to reduced customer demand 
in addition  depreciation expense increased by million  which was partially offset by improvements in product mix 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during the increase was primarily due to an expansion and focus in research and development efforts on new product development  requiring increased staffing and support costs  including automated design tools 
in addition  our purchase of the rf group from fairchild semiconductor on september  which further added to our new product development capability  impacted the year on year comparison in the amount of million  such amount was primarily comprised of staffing related costs 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase included million associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer  including million of stock based compensation upon accelerated vesting of certain equity awards 
the remaining increase was primarily driven by increased staff and outside advisors costs 
restructuring and impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a workforce reduction which eliminated approximately positions resulting in a restructuring charge of million  principally for severance and related benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated alternatives with regard to our investment in the construction of a wafer fabrication facility in kunshan china in light of surplus industry production capacity  reduced demand experienced by the company  as well as the broader macroeconomic environment 
we determined that the carrying amount of the china fabrication building was not recoverable as the carrying amount was greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and disposition of these assets 
as a result of this impairment analysis  we recorded a full million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the fair value of the wifi reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  and thus we performed step two of the impairment test 
our step two analysis resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill and therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  representing a write off of the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
in connection with our goodwill impairment analysis  we also assessed the fair values of our related intangible assets  which carried an unamortized value of million consisting principally of assembled workforce related to the wifi reporting unit noting it was similarly impaired and charged the remaining unamortized carrying value to restructuring and impairment charges 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally as we reinvested funds and concentrated our investments in shorter term vehicles which carried federal deposit insurance 
interest expense 
interest expense was essentially flat at million in compared to million in the interest expense arises from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in october notes 
other expense 
other expense was million in compared to million in and included charges for other than temporary declines in value on certain auction rate securities ars held by the company of million and million respectively 
while interest continues to be paid currently by all the issuers of these ars  due to the severity of the decline in fair value and the duration of time for which these ars have been in a loss position  the company concluded that ars held at december  experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value and recorded impairment charges of million for the year ended december  the aforementioned other than temporary impairment charge was net of million of income recorded on par value redemption recoveries 
additionally during  a corporate debt ars position was exchanged for the underlying year notes 
this debt trades in the market with a value of million against its face value of million 
due to the severity and duration of the decline  the company has recorded an impairment of million related to this security 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million in and included million loss on the sale of the majority of the operating assets of telcom devices inc upon its sale at the close of the first quarter of liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
in october  we repaid million aggregate principal amount of our notes upon maturity 
operations used million in cash during  primarily as a result of our operating results adjusted for non cash expenses which was partly offset by million generated by reducing working capital 
investing activities provided million of cash during  consisting of net sales of marketable securities of million and million of proceeds on sales of fixed assets  which were partly offset by purchases of equipment of million 
financing activities required million of cash during  which principally consisted of repayment of our million convertible notes  partly offset by proceeds received from the employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
at december   the company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately million 
we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchases of our equity 
subject to liquidity considerations of our auction rate securities as discussed more fully in item a  we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and available for sale securities are exposed to changes in short term interest rates 
our available for sale securities consist of a corporate bond security and certain auction rate securities discussed more specifically below 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss would be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated interest rate by expected maturity value fair value s years total s principal weighted average stated interest rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have valued some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of our current holdings  which would affect both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
we invest our cash in money market funds in order to maintain liquidity and as well as fund operations and hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on our balance sheet at market value 
within our million in marketable securities at december   we held a total of million of auction rate securities ars and million as a corporate debt security  which was originally purchased as an ars prior to its exchange for the underlying year notes due ars are generally financial instruments of long term duration with interest rates that are reset in short intervals through auctions 
during the second half of  certain auction rate debt and preferred securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in failures of the auction process for a broader range of ars  including substantially all of the auction rate corporate  state and municipal debt and preferred equity securities we hold 
when there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction and the auction is not completed  the interest rates reset to predetermined higher rates default rates 
while certain issuers redeemed certain of their ars during  the market remained constrained by illiquidity and the lack of free trading 
the funds associated with the remaining failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or an issuer redeems its security 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an additional impairment charge 
to date  we have not realized any losses on ars held by the company or the notes received in exchange for an ars  but have recognized other than temporary impairments of million 
during  fair market values of certain of our ars  when combined with the fair market values of our corporate debt security  increased by million  which was recorded to other comprehensive income 
we anticipate selling these impaired debt securities prior to a recovery in valuation 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments for impairment and for short term classification purposes 
we may not be able to access cash by selling the aforementioned debt or preferred securities without the loss of principal until a buyer is located  a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by their issuers or they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we may be required to hold them to maturity or in perpetuity for the preferred ars 
based on our ability to access our cash  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our notes were convertible with a fixed rate of interest of and were repaid on the october  maturity date
