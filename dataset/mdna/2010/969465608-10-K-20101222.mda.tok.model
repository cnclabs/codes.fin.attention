for a discussion of factors affecting our business  see item business in this annual report on form k 
further  this section includes forward looking statements which should be read in conjunction with the section entitled item a risk factors 
overview net sales increased to  in fiscal  up when compared to fiscal the low point of the economic cycle relevant to our operations appears to have occurred during our third quarter of fiscal and sales have steadily increased since that time 
although we have seen improvement from our low point in fiscal  the heavy truck industry is still significantly below levels prior to the economic downturn with our fiscal sales being below fiscal sales levels 
while we continue to closely monitor all of our costs  and we remain committed to spending on new product development and technology for existing and new customers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company paid a cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record as of july  although no assurances can be given  management believes that it is likely that our  in cash on hand plus available borrowing of  under our revolving loan facility will be adequate to sustain the company through the foreseeable future 
as we move forward into fiscal and beyond  we will continue to work closely with our existing and potential customers to design and develop new products and adapt existing products to new applications  and to improve the performance  reliability and cost effectiveness of our products 
results of operations financial summary dollars in thousands to to net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development    selling    administration    class action settlement nm nm gain from settlement of environmental claims  nm nm operating income loss    as a percentage of net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling administration class action settlement gain from settlement of environmental claims operating income loss nm not meaningful comparative years ended september   and percent change to to for the year ended september net sales    net sales increased  for fiscal as compared fiscal the overall increase in sales in fiscal results from volume increases in essentially all of our principal geographic markets 
in fiscal  we saw significant reductions in the number of units of trucks  buses and off road vehicles built worldwide due to the significant recessionary pressures in the united states and many parts of the rest of the world and as a result  essentially all of our large truck oem customers had reductions in build rates and took extensive down time in as the economic climate has improved worldwide in fiscal and our truck oem customers have increased build rates  the result has been an overall increase in sales volumes in all our markets 
net sales to customers in asia increased over the prior year primarily due to increased sales volumes of heavy trucks in korea and heavy trucks and off road vehicles in china 
increases in off road volumes in china primarily results from adoption of more stringent emissions standards  which mandate the inclusion of electronic throttle controls on new vehicles  thus allowing us to expand our customer base in this market 
korean sales have increased due to improvements in the economic climate in korea and an increase in the number of truck sales 
european truck sales were up in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to our european customers increasing their heavy truck build rates and working through the build up of inventory levels experienced in fiscal net sales to nafta truck customers were up over fiscal due to continued improvements in the economic environment and freight hauling 
these improvements more than offset the company s expected declines associated with the emission standards enacted in north america in calendar which drove higher truck costs to comply with these new emission standards 
we believe that nafta truck sales may improve slightly over the next few quarters as the economic environment continues to improve 
worldwide off road sales were up for the fiscal year ended september  the largest contributor to this increase in off road sales occurred in the nafta market  where off road sales were up primarily due to continued increases in sales related to united states military vehicle applications 
we expect that electronic throttle control sales generally will continue to vary directly with future changes in the overall economy and the demand for heavy trucks  transit buses and off road vehicles in particular 
these variations are largely dependent upon  and are expected to vary directly with  production volumes in the various geographic markets in which we serve 
additionally  competitive pricing may reduce margins and gross sales 
net sales decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in sales resulted from volume reductions in essentially all of our principal markets  which we believe was due to the decline in the world economic climate and the impact that decline has had on our customers and the end markets for their products 
in the north american market  sales to heavy truck customers were down compared to fiscal  which is the direct result of the overall reductions in truck build rates in north america 
our share of that market and unit pricing remained essentially unchanged from the prior year 
the sales declines to our european truck customers were even more dramatic  decreasing over the prior year 
on a year over year basis  sales to asia decreased 
net sales to off road customers decreased as that market also experienced reduced prod uction rates in response to the lower levels of construction activity worldwide 
percent change to to for the year ended september cost of sales    the types of expenses included in cost of sales include raw materials  freight and duty  warranty  wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  production utilities  shipping and production supplies  repairs and maintenance  production facility property insurance  and other production overhead 
as a percent of sales  cost of sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher sales volumes to distribute fixed overhead 
additionally  fiscal included settlement of outstanding labor issues and severance costs totaling and a write down to our capitalized license fee related to adjustable pedal technology due to the significant decline in business in the recreational vehicle industry 
repairs and maintenance costs and pension postretirement medical costs decreased and  respectively  in fiscal from the comparable period in fiscal slightly offsetting some of these decreases was an increase in warranty costs of in fiscal when compared to fiscal and primarily relates to warranty claims with one customer 
in addition  freight and duty costs increased in fiscal when compared to fi scal cost of sales increased as a percent of sales in fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to significantly lower sales volumes to cover fixed overhead costs 
fiscal also included settlement of outstanding labor issues and severance costs of  a write down in our capitalized license fee related to adjustable pedals  and an overall increase in warranty costs over fiscal offsetting some of these cost increases were overall reductions in salary cost related to our cost reduction program in fiscal percent change to to for the year ended september gross profit    gross profit was  or of net sales for fiscal  an increase of  from the gross profit of  or of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily driven by the net increase in sales of electronic throttle control systems to our heavy truck  bus and off road customers 
manufacturing overhead costs were lower as a percent of sales in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily due to the factors described above under cost of sales 
gross profit was  or of net sales for fiscal  a decrease of  from the gross profit of  or of net sales  in fiscal the gross profit decline in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the net decrease in sales of electronic throttle control systems to our heavy truck  transit bus and off road customers 
our business is not entirely scalable  which means that certain overhead costs will not vary directly in proportion to sales volumes  particularly during periods of declining sales 
however  direct production costs such as materials and labor generally fluctuate with sales volumes 
percent change to to for the year ended september research and development   research and development expenses increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to increased resources  including additional headcount  being committed to new project development for sensors and joysticks 
the company s research and development expenditures generally will fluctuate based on the products under development at any given point in time  and that fluctuation often does not coincide with sales cycles 
research and development expenses in fiscal were essentially unchanged when compared to fiscal although our sales were down  our cash flows were negatively impacted and we instituted temporary company wide salary reductions in fiscal  we felt that it was strategically important to continue our commitment to and spending for new product development and technology for existing and new customers and programs 
percent change to to for the year ended september selling    selling expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal mainly due to an increase in travel expenses and sales commissions  which tend to correlate with relatively higher sales volumes 
selling expenses decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal mainly due to lower overall travel expenses  reduction in salary costs as a result of our cost reduction program in fiscal and reductions in sales commission expenses as a result of lower commission sales 
percent change to to for the year ended september administration    administration expenses for fiscal decreased slightly when compared to fiscal the decrease in administration expenses is primarily due to fiscal s having included in non cash compensation expense related to our unfunded deferred compensation plan  compared to a like expense of in fiscal in addition  bad debt expense decreased from the prior year 
offsetting these decreases in administration expense during fiscal was a increase in legal fees  primarily associated with the cuesta class action lawsuit  which is also discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  wage related expenses increased in fiscal due to reinstating full wages at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  wage related expenses were reduced during the last half of the year as pa rt of the cost reduction program put into place in fiscal administration expenses for fiscal were essentially unchanged when compared to fiscal increases in administration expenses included a non cash compensation expense recognized in conjunction with our unfunded deferred compensation plan during fiscal and an overall increase in bad debt expense of offsetting some of these increases in administration expenses were reductions in salary costs and director fees resulting from implementing certain cost cutting measures during fiscal  including temporary company wide salary reductions and a reduction in fees paid to the members of the company s board of directors 
in addition  audit fees related to our compliance with section b of the sarbanes oxley act decreased 
at september   we were not required to be audited under the requirements of section b of the sarbanes oxley act due to our public float decreasing below the required level for an audit of internal controls  however we maintained all of our internally generated internal control measures 
this change resulted in a corresponding decrease in audit fees related to such services 
percent change to to for the year ended september class action settlement nm nm during fiscal  the company recorded a liability which represents the agreed upon obligation for the company per the settlement agreement related to the cuesta class action lawsuit discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the was paid for full settlement and release of any future obligations 
percent change to to for the year ended september gain from settlement of environmental claims  nm nm as part of our contractual indemnity claim against dana and contribution claims against blount and rosan  as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  during fiscal we received cash payments totaling from dana  blount and rosan and shares in dana equal to approximately at the time of settlement 
as of september   we recorded a gain of  in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
percent change to to for the year ended september gain on sale of investments nm nm during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our short term investments and recorded a gain related to the sale 
the majority of the shares sold related to the company s investment in dana as part of the environmental settlement discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
the gain recognized in fiscal was primarily the result of writing down the basis of our investments as discussed below with the impairment charge recorded in fiscal percent change to to for the year ended september loss on impairment of investments nm nm loss on impairment of investments is a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge relating to our common stock of dana during the first quarter of fiscal the impairment charge assumes no income tax benefit given the uncertainty of the company s ability to generate future taxable investment gains required to utilize these investment losses 
prior to recording the impairment charge  the decline in market value was carried net of tax in other comprehensive loss 
following the recording of this impairment charge  all subsequent changes in market value of our short term investments is recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income loss 
percent change to to for the year ended september other income expense  net nm nm other income of in fiscal consisted primarily of a gain from the extinguishment of old outstanding accounts payable balances of various insolvent subsidiaries offset slightly by losses related to the disposal of certain fixed assets 
other expense of in fiscal primarily consisted of losses related to the disposal of certain fixed assets 
other income of in fiscal consisted primarily of a gain related to the sales and disposal of certain fixed assets and foreign currency gains 
percent change to to for the year ended september income tax expense benefit  in fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal and income tax expense of  in fiscal the overall tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the mix of pretax earnings between domestic and foreign jurisdictions  primarily in china 
the mix of earnings combined with lower tax rates in our foreign jurisdictions caused the tax rate to decline from prior years 
the increase in the effective tax rate when comparing fiscal and is primarily due to the mix of pretax earnings losses between domestic and foreign jurisdictions  particularly in china 
additionally  a favorable r d credit adjustment was recorded due to a change in united states tax law and the initial recording of our chinese deferred tax assets during fiscal which combined to increase the tax rate by 
this increase was partially offset by a valuation allowance against an unrealized investment loss and an unfavorable domestic production activities deduction adjustment related to the federal net operating loss carry back 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of changes in our overall tax rate 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of  during the fourth quarter  we paid a per share cash dividend to all stockholders of record totaling  during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a revolving loan facility with us bank and as of september  we had  available under our revolving loan facility 
we believe our cash on hand and our capacity under the new revolving loan facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
cash generated from operations was  for fiscal  a decrease of  from the cash generated from operations of  for fiscal net income loss plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation contributed cash of  in fiscal compared to for fiscal changes in working capital items used cash of for fiscal compared to generating cash of  in fiscal changes in receivables in fiscal were a use of cash of  compared to a  generation of cash in fiscal the significant cash generation from the collection of receivables in fiscal was due to the reduction in sales and accounts receivable due to the deterioration of the general economy during that quarter 
the increase in receivables in fiscal is the result of higher sales levels 
inventories increased  in fiscal in relation to increased sales compared to a decrease of  in fiscal accounts payable and accrued expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increases in purchases of inventory and supplies to remain in line with the significant increase in sales volumes  whereas the decrease in a ccounts payable and accrued expenses in was primarily due to the lower sales and inventory purchases 
cash flows from operations for fiscal included payments to our pension plans of compared to contributions of for fiscal also included in cash flows from operations in fiscal was the cuesta class action settlement payment as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements 
we believe it is likely we will continue to generate positive cash from operations  however  depending on changes in the worldwide economic market  we could experience periods of negative cash flow from operations 
cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal cash flows from investing activities for fiscal included purchases of equipment of  and were offset slightly by of proceeds related to the sale of investments 
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal included purchases of equipment of  we expect our cash use for investing activities to at least remain constant and potentially increase in the future as we continue to purchase capital equipment to expand and support our operations worldwide 
we currently anticipate spending approximately  in capital expenditures for fiscal cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to cash used in financing activities of  for fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid a cash dividend to stockholders of record as of the close of business on july  totaling  in october  we announced a share repurchase plan whereby the company can  but is under no obligation  to repurchase up to  of the company s common stock 
repurchases may be made in the open market or through bock trades  in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
in fiscal  we purchased  shares of common stock at a total value of  we did not make any repurchases during fiscal in addition  fiscal and included cash generation of and  respectively  related to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations as of september  at september   our contractual obligations consisted of operating lease obligations and a license agreement 
we do not have any letters of credit or debt guarantees outstanding at september  maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period less than total year years years operating leases  license minimum royalties certain liabilities  including those related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans  are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of stated maturities 
we have net obligations at september  related to our pension plans and post retirement medical plan of  and  respectively 
we funded to our pension plans in fiscal compared to in fiscal and we expect to make payments of  in fiscal to fund our pension plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ fr om these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment  which is when title and risk of loss transfers to customers  and when all of the following have occurred a firm sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are reported net of estimated returns  rebates and customer discounts 
discounts and rebates are recorded during the period they are earned by the customer 
product warranty we provide a warranty covering defects arising from products sold 
the product warranty liability is based on historical return rates of products and amounts for significant and specific warranty issues 
the warranty is limited to a specified time period  mileage or hours of use  and varies by product  application and customer 
the company has recorded a warranty liability which  in the opinion of management  is adequate to cover such costs 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  they are subject to change and such change could be material 
legal we are involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings from time to time 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
in connection with such claims and lawsuits  we estimate the probability of losses based on advice of legal counsel  the outcomes of similar litigation  legislative development and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
we expense legal expenses related to claims in the period incurred  including  in the c ase of expenses subject to contingencies  in the period in which we determine that it is probable that all remaining contingencies will be satisfied and the amount of such expenses have been established with reasonable certainty 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental costs we estimate the costs of investigation and remediation for certain soil and groundwater contaminants at our portland  oregon facility 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of this site cannot be predicted with certainty due to the often unknown magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to accomplish such cleanups and the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations 
management has recognized a liability for environmental remediation costs for this site in an amount that management believes is probable and reasonably estimable 
when the estimate of a probable loss is within a range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued when no estimate within the range is better than another 
in making these judgments a nd assumptions  management considers  among other things  the activity to date at the site and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
management regularly monitors the company s exposure to environmental loss contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimated liability accrual will occur in the near future 
pensions and post retirement benefit obligations pension and post retirement benefit obligations and net period benefit cost are calculated using actuarial models 
the most important assumptions that affect these computations are the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated at least annually and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
to determine our discount rate  we discounted the expected benefit payments using the principal pension discount yield curve 
the equivalent level interest rate that produces the same present value of benefits was then determined 
our assumed rate does not differ significantly from this benchmark rate 
we assumed a discount rate of to determine our pension benefit obligations at september  and a rate of to determine our net periodic benefit cost in fiscal a decrease in these discount rates would have increased our pension benefit obligations at the end of fiscal by  and increased our net periodic benefit cost in by a increase in discount r ates would have decreased our pension obligations at september  by  and decreased our net periodic benefit cost in fiscal by to determine the discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan  we also discounted the expected benefit payments using the principal pension discount yield curve and assumed a discount rate of to determine our post retirement benefit obligations at september  and a rate of to determine our post retirement benefit cost in fiscal a decrease in discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased our post retirement benefit expense in fiscal by a increase in discount rate would have decreased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and our post retirement benefit expense in fiscal would have been essentially the same 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current asset allocations and the historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes to develop a risk free real rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class 
the overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long term inflation component  the risk free real rate of return  and the associated risk premium 
a weighted average rate was then developed based on those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have impacted net periodic benefit cost in fiscal by our post retirement plan does not contain any plan assets 
we assumed healthcare cost trend rates for our post retirement plan of in fiscal  decreasing gradually to in fiscal and remaining at thereafter 
a increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased post retirement benefit expense in by a decrease in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have decreased the post retirement benefit obligation by at the end of fiscal and decreased post retirement benefit expense in fiscal by share based compensation expense we measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards  and awards we grant  modify  repurchase or cancel in the future  at fair value and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when calculating fair value including estimated stock price volatility  expected term and expected forfeitures 
factors considered in estimating forfeitures include the types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
income taxes for each jurisdiction that we operate in  we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
our income tax provision on the consolidated statement of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
this process is complex and involves significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our net de ferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting standards in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that establishes criteria for a milestone to be considered substantive and allows revenue recognition when the milestone is achieved in research and development arrangements 
in addition  this guidance requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones 
this guidance is effective for the company prospectively beginning october  the company has evaluated this guidance and does not expect its adoption will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to require employers to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post retirement plan 
these disclosures include information detailing investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and an understanding of significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this guidance was effective for the company beginning in fiscal october  
this guidance is not required to be applied to earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued guidance that is effective for specified fair value measures of non financial assets and liabilities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments 
the company s primary market risk results from fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies 
interest rate risk the company has a revolving loan facility with us bank  which expires on june  as of september   there was no balance outstanding on the revolving loan 
management does not believe a change in end of period interest rates of or less  or changes in future interest rates on this variable rate obligation would have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company has not hedged its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
foreign currency risk we sell our products to customers in the heavy truck  transit bus and off road equipment industries 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  the company had foreign sales of approximately and of net sales  respectively 
all worldwide sales in fiscal and  with the exception of  and  respectively  were denominated in us dollars 
we have established a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china and sales offices in shanghai  china and munich  germany 
during fiscal  we established a manufacturing facility in pune  india 
we purchase components internationally for use in both our products whose sales are denominated in us dollars and other currencies 
although the company is expanding its international exposure  it does not believe that changes in future exchange rates would have a material effect on its financial posi tion  results of operations  or cash flows at this time 
as a result  the company has not entered into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions to hedge against foreign currency risk 
the company will continue to assess its foreign currency risk as its international operations  international purchases and sales increase 
investment risk the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
the company s cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are short term in nature  and  thus  the company believes they are not exposed to material investment risk
