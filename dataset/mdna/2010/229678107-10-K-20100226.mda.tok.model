cubicin 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from cubicin daptomycin for injection  which we launched in the us in november and currently commercialize on our own in the us cubicin is a once daily  bactericidal  intravenous  or iv  antibiotic with activity against methicillin resistant s 
aureus  or mrsa  and  as of december   has been used in the treatment of more than an estimated  patients with serious infections caused by gram positive pathogens such as mrsa 
cubicin is approved in the us for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections  or csssi  caused by staphylococcus aureus  or s 
aureus  and certain other gram positive bacteria  and for s 
aureus bloodstream infections bacteremia  including those with right sided infective endocarditis  or rie  caused by methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates 
in the european union  or eu  cubicin is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections  or cssti  where the presence of susceptible gram positive bacteria is confirmed or suspected and for rie due to s 
aureus bacteremia and s 
aureus bacteremia associated with rie or cssti 
the following is a breakdown of our revenues from cubicin in thousands net worldwide revenues net us revenues international revenues our net worldwide revenues for cubicin represent net us revenues and international revenues  which represent the payments we receive from international distributors in connection with their commercialization of cubicin 
our total international revenues are primarily based on sales of cubicin by novartis ag  or novartis which sells cubicin through a subsidiary  our distribution partner in the eu 
we expect both net revenues from sales of cubicin in the us and our revenues from cubicin sales outside the us to continue to increase due primarily to increased vial sales  market penetration into a large and growing market  and price increases we and our international partners may implement 
future sales of cubicin are  to a large extent  dependent upon our ability to compete successfully with the products of current and future competitors  the growth of the market for cubicin  our ability to secure sufficient quantities of cubicin to meet demand and  in particular  to work with the supplier of our cubicin active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  to complete the expansion of the capacity at the facility at which it manufactures cubicin api  including the receipt of any related required regulatory approvals  on a timely basis  and our ability to obtain  maintain and enforce us and foreign patent protection for cubicin  and continuing to have cubicin reimbursed at adequate levels by third party payors and maintaining discount and rebate levels for federal government programs at levels that are similar to the current levels 
on february   we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from teva parenteral medicines  inc  or teva  notifying us that teva has submitted an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
teva s notice letter advised that it is seeking fda approval to market daptomycin for injection  the active ingredient in cubicin  prior to the expiration of us patent nos 
 and  which expire on september   and us patent no 
re  which expires on june  each of these patents is listed in the fda s list of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  also known as the orange book 
the notice letter further stated that teva is asserting that claims in the referenced patents are not infringed and or invalid 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against teva  teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in response to the anda filing 
the complaint  which was 
table of contents filed in the us district court for the district of delaware  alleges infringement of the referenced patents 
under current us law  the filing of the lawsuit automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda for months from our receipt of teva s paragraph iv notification letter on february   unless the court enters judgment in favor of teva in less than months  or finds that a party has failed to cooperate reasonably to expedite the lawsuit 
the court has set a date for trial beginning on april  the court also scheduled a claim construction hearing aka a markman hearing for june  the court indicated that summary judgment motions will not be permitted in this lawsuit 
we are confident in our intellectual property portfolio protecting cubicin  including the patents listed in the orange book 
it is possible that additional third parties may seek to market generic versions of cubicin in the us by filing an anda 
merrem iv in july  we entered into an exclusive agreement with astrazeneca pharmaceuticals  lp  or astrazeneca  to promote and provide other support in the us for merrem us meropenem for injection  an established carbapenem class iv antibiotic 
under the agreement  we promote and support merrem iv using our existing us acute care sales and medical affairs organizations 
astrazeneca provides marketing and commercial support for merrem iv we recognize revenues from this agreement as service revenues 
for the second half of and all of  the agreement established a baseline annual payment by astrazeneca to us of million pro rated for  received in quarterly increments  to be adjusted up or down by a true up payment or refund at the end of the year based on actual us sales of merrem us exceeding or falling short of an established annual baseline sales amount  subject to a minimum annual payment of million 
for the second half of and all of  we could have also earned a percentage of the gross profit on sales exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
the payments for any such sales over the baseline amount would have been recognized in the quarter in which astrazeneca provided us with its annual sales report 
service revenues of million for the year ended december   include a million payment received in for exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
the actual us sales were below the established annual baseline sales amount 
as such we will not receive a gross profit percentage payment for sales in the first quarter of given anticipated market conditions for carbapenems and the potential impact of the june expiration of the composition of matter patent for merrem iv in the iv  we and astrazeneca entered into an amendment to the agreement in december the amendment establishes a six month baseline sales amount for with a six month baseline payment of up to million  received in quarterly increments  to be adjusted up or down by a true up payment or refund at the end of the six month period based on actual us sales of merrem iv exceeding or falling short of the established six month baseline sales amount 
if the actual us sales fall short of the six month baseline sales amount  the amendment provides stepped down payments  subject to a minimum payment of million 
the amendment also provides for the possibility that we will market merrem iv during the final six months of if we and astrazeneca mutually agree that the agreement should continue on acceptable terms 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach an agreement with astrazeneca to promote merrem iv after june  product pipeline 
we are building a pipeline of acute care therapies through licensing and collaboration agreements as well as by progressing into clinical development compounds that we have developed internally 
summaries of the license and collaboration agreements referenced below are set forth in note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
cb  we obtained an exclusive license for the development and commercialization in north america and europe of the iv formulation of cb  for the prevention of blood loss during surgery pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement with dyax corp  or dyax 
we are studying cb  initially in the reduction of blood loss in patients undergoing cardiac surgery using 
table of contents cardiopulmonary bypass  which includes coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg  and heart valve repair and replacement procedures 
in march  we began a phase dose ranging trial  conserv  assessing three different doses of ecallantide in cardiac surgery patients using cardiopulmonary bypass undergoing procedures associated with a relatively low risk of bleeding 
in july  we began a phase trial  conserv  assessing a high dose of ecallantide in cardiac surgery patients using cardiopulmonary bypass undergoing procedures associated with a higher risk of bleeding 
in december  we announced the early closing of enrollment of both phase trials based on a recommendation from the data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  to close the conserv trial due to the observation of a statistically significant difference in mortality between the arms of the conserv trial that the dsmb felt needed to be assessed before the trial could be resumed 
overall mortality was consistent with expected outcomes for the patient population in the conserv trial 
however  the data for patients treated in the trial as of the closing of enrollment showed more deaths in the cb  arm 
initial review shows mortality observed in the trial was due to a variety of causes typically expected in a high risk for bleed population undergoing cardiac surgery 
there was no such imbalance detected by the dsmb in the conserv trial 
we expect to complete analysis of all the data from both conserv and conserv in the first half of and subsequently determine next steps for the program 
cxa we acquired calixa therapeutics inc  or calixa  in december and with it rights to cxa  calixa s lead compound  an iv combination of a novel anti pseudomonal cephalosporin  cxa  which calixa licensed from astellas pharma  inc  astellas  and the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam 
cxa is currently in phase clinical trials for complicated urinary tract infection  or cuti 
we obtained calixa s rights to develop and commercialize the lead compound  cxa  and other products that incorporate cxa under a license agreement with astellas  as further described below  we have the exclusive rights to develop  manufacture  market and sell any eventual products which incorporate cxa  including cxa  in all territories of the world except select asia pacific and middle east territories 
cxa is being developed as a first line therapy for the treatment of certain serious gram negative bacterial infections in the hospital  including those caused by multi drug resistant  or mdr  pseudomonas aeruginosa  or p 
aeruginosa 
pan resistant p 
aeruginosa resistant in vitro to all groups of antibiotics is a major cause of opportunistic infections among immunocompromised patients 
we anticipate advancing the clinical program for cuti and complicated intra abdominal infection  or ciai  in the first half of the next study in the cuti program would take into consideration the results of the ongoing cuti trial with cxa in addition  a phase trial of cxa for ciai is expected to begin in the first half of in the second half of  we also expect to begin lung pharmacokinetic studies of cxa for hospital acquired pneumonia and ventilator associated pneumonia 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  which is summarized in note d  business combinations  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we paid the calixa stockholders million  subject to certain adjustments and escrow provisions  and calixa became our wholly owned subsidiary 
we are also required to make potential payments to calixa stockholders of up to million upon achieving certain development  regulatory  and commercial milestones related to products which incorporate cxa this contingent consideration liability is recognized at its estimated fair value of million on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  cb  cb  is in phase clinical trials for the treatment of mdr gram negative infections 
we plan to make a go no go decision on whether to advance cb  into phase trials in the first quarter of cb  is a novel  proprietary  iv administered gram negative antibiotic that has demonstrated in vitro efficacy and rapid bactericidal activity against the key mdr gram negative pathogens  including p 
aeruginosa  e 
coli  k 
pnuemoniae  and a 
baumannii 
in animal models  cb  was shown to be effective against lung  kidney  bloodstream and thigh infections against all mdr gram negative strains tested 

table of contents cb  cb  is in phase clinical trials for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea  or cdad 
we expect to launch phase clinical trials for the same indication in the first half of cb  is a potent  oral  cidal lipopeptide with rapid in vitro bactericidal activity against c 
difficile  which is an opportunistic anaerobic gram positive bacterium which causes cdad 
recent years have witnessed the emergence of a hypervirulent strain of c 
difficile that produces much higher levels of toxins 
this strain also demonstrates high level resistance to fluoroquinolones  which may have contributed to its spread throughout the us  canada  the uk  the netherlands and belgium 
physicians have noted an increase in incidence and mortality rates as well as increases in numbers of patients requiring emergency colectomy removal of all or part of the colon or admission to intensive care units 
aln rsv 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc  or alnylam  for the development and commercialization of alnylam s rna interference  or rnai  therapeutics as potential therapy for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  infection  an area of high unmet medical need  particularly in children 
the agreement was amended in november to carve aln rsv  which is in phase clinical trials  out of the collaboration  subject to our rights to opt in to development after alnylam completes a phase b study of aln rsv for the treatment of rsv infection in adult lung transplant patients 
we have a pre investigational new drug application  or ind  program underway in novel treatments for rsv infections in children using alnylam s rnai technology

gross us product revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in gross us product revenues was primarily due to increased vial sales of cubicin in the us  which resulted in higher gross us product revenues of million  as well as price increases for cubicin in october and june  which resulted in million of additional gross us product revenues 
gross us product revenues are offset by allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks  discounts and wholesaler management fees of million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in allowances against us gross product revenues was primarily driven by increases in chargebacks and medicaid rebates due to increased us sales of cubicin  as well as the price increases described above 
international product revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  consisted 
table of contents primarily of cubicin product sales to  and royalty payments based on cubicin net sales in the eu from novartis 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product 
we pay certain wholesalers various fees for data supply and administration services 
net product revenue is reduced by any such fees

the million increase in non cash charges is primarily attributable to the difference between a deferred tax provision of million in compared to a deferred tax benefit of million in  as a result of a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million used in investing activities in and million provided by investing activities in cash used in investing activities in consisted of million for the acquisition of calixa  and also includes the purchase of million in investments  offset by proceeds of million from our investments  and the purchase of million of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities during the twelve months ended december   included the payment of million to former shareholders of illumigen  which we acquired in december cash used in investing activities in also included million of purchases of property and equipment  including million of assets related to the construction of approximately  square feet of additional laboratory space at our main building at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  as well as approximately million of assets related to renovating additional leased space at the and hayden avenue building in lexington  massachusetts 
cash provided by investing activities in consisted of a net cash inflow of million related to maturities offset by purchases of securities  as well as cash outflows from purchases of property and equipment of million and million for the acquisition of illumigen  net of cash acquired 
we estimate that capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million  driven by the investment in laboratory equipment  information technology solutions and enhancements to support the needs of an expanding business  as well as facility and leasehold improvements  including the work to expand our facility at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was million  compared to million used in financing activities in and million provided by financing activities in cash provided 
table of contents by financing activities includes cash received from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities in also includes million of cash used to repurchase million of our notes 
auction rate securities at december  and  we held auction rate securities with an original par value of million  all of which mature in these auction rate securities  which consist of private placement  synthetic collateralized debt obligations  are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
due to repeated failed auctions since august  we do not consider these securities to be liquid and have therefore classified them as long term investments 
a decline in the financial markets has impacted the fair value of our auction rate securities 
as of december  and  we estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities to be million and million  respectively 
as of december   our investment in auction rate securities is our only financial asset measured using level inputs in accordance with accounting guidance for fair value measurements and represents approximately of the total financial assets measured at fair value 
additional information can be found in note e  investments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of the auction rate securities could change significantly based on future financial market conditions 
the fair value of our auction rate securities increased by million during the twelve months ended december   primarily related to improved financial market conditions 
we will continue to monitor the securities and the financial markets  and if there is deterioration in the fair value of these securities  individually or in the aggregate  it could result in other than temporary impairment charges 
credit facility in december  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with rbs citizens  national association  or rbs citizens  for general corporate purposes 
under the revolving credit facility  we may request to borrow at any time a minimum of million up to the maximum of the available remaining credit 
the facility will be secured by the pledge of a certificate of deposit issued by rbs citizens and or an rbs citizens money market account equal to an aggregate of of the outstanding principal amount of the loans  so long as such loans are outstanding 
interest on the borrowings can be calculated  at our option  based on libor plus a margin or the prime rate 
any borrowings under the facility are due on demand or upon termination of the revolving credit agreement 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of december  repurchases of common stock or convertible subordinated notes outstanding from time to time  our board of directors may authorize us to repurchase shares of our common stock or our outstanding convertible subordinated notes in privately negotiated transactions  or publicly announced programs 
if and when our board of directors should determine to authorize any such action  it would be on terms and under market conditions that the board of directors determines are in the best interest of our company 
any such repurchases could deplete some of our cash resources 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings on february   we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from teva  notifying cubist that teva has submitted an anda to the fda for approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
teva s notice letter advised that it is seeking fda approval to market daptomycin for 
table of contents injection  the active ingredient in cubicin  prior to the expiration of us patent nos 
 and  which expire on september   and us patent no 
re  which expires on june  each of these patents is listed in the fda s list of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  also known as the orange book 
the notice letter further stated that teva is asserting that claims in the referenced patents are not infringed and or invalid 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against teva  teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc and teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in response to the anda filing 
the complaint  which was filed in the us district court for the district of delaware  alleges infringement of the referenced patents 
under current us law  the filing of the lawsuit automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda for months from our receipt of teva s paragraph iv notification letter on february   unless the court enters judgment in favor of teva in less than months  or finds that a party has failed to cooperate reasonably to expedite the lawsuit 
the court has set a date for trial beginning on april  the court also scheduled a claims construction hearing aka a markman hearing for june   and has indicated that summary judgment motions will not be permitted in this lawsuit 
we have retained the services of wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp  or wilmerhale  to represent us in the anda litigation 
we have entered into a fee arrangement with wilmerhale under which we will pay wilmerhale a fixed monthly fee over the course of the litigation and a potential additional payment that could be due to wilmerhale based on the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit 
we are accruing amounts due to wilmerhale based on our best estimate of the fees that we expect to incur as services are provided 
based on the nature of this fee arrangement  we could incur legal fees in excess of amounts accrued as a result of future events 
business agreements upon achievement of certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our various business agreements  including license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
during the twelve months ended december   we made a million upfront payment to alnylam  which represented the payment due upon signing our collaboration agreement with alnylam for the development and commercialization of alnylam s rnai therapeutics as potential therapy for the treatment of rsv infection 
additionally  during the twelve months ended december   we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with hydra under which we made a million upfront payment 
unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of this agreement  we will also provide research and development funding payments of million annually to hydra for the first and second years of the research collaboration 
these payments were included in research and development expense for the twelve months ended december  additional information regarding our business agreements can be found in note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
contingent consideration if certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones are achieved with respect to products incorporating cxa  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired calixa in december  to make future milestone payments to the former shareholders of calixa 
in accordance with accounting for business combinations guidance  this contingent consideration liability is required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
the total undiscounted potential milestone payments range from zero to million 
the estimated fair value of these payments  after adjustments for probabilities of success and a discount factor  was million as of december  as of december   the contingent consideration related to the calixa acquisition is our only financial liability measured using level inputs in accordance with 
table of contents accounting guidance for fair value measurements and represents of the total financial liabilities measured at fair value 
the fair value of contingent consideration is required to be reassessed at each reporting period  with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statement of income as other income expense 
the amount and timing of any such payments cannot be reliably predicted  and accordingly  such payments are excluded from the contractual obligations table below 
additional information can be found in note d  business combinations  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities  such as royalties on future sales above the contractual minimums  potential milestone payments and continent consideration associated with the acquisition of calixa  as we cannot reasonably predict the amount and timing of future payment 
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of million have also been excluded from the table below due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period year or less years years more than years total in millions subordinated convertible notes interest on subordinated convertible notes operating leases  net of sublease income royalty payments due inventory purchase obligations other purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the subordinated convertible notes consist of a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in june these notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
our operating leases consist of approximately  square feet of office and data center space at and hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in september for approximately  square feet  and april for approximately  square feet  as well as  square feet of commercial space at sidney street in cambridge  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in december we have subleased the space located at sidney street through october the royalty payments listed above represent amounts expected to be owed to eli lilly on sales of cubicin 
the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent purchases for the manufacturing of cubicin api by our supplier  acs dobfar spa  or acsd  as well as payments for converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation 
the other purchase obligations listed above primarily represent expected future payments for clinical trial expenses  payments pursuant to research funding and collaboration agreements and payments related to the expansion at acsd s cubicin api manufacturing facility  as described below 
we have a manufacturing and supply agreement with acsd which was amended in november under this amendment  we and acsd have agreed to a a project plan for the process  equipment and associated plant improvements and expansion to the facility intended to increase the 
table of contents capacity of the facility to produce cubicin api and the reimbursement to acsd for certain costs associated with these activities  b a new cubicin api pricing schedule based on payments in euros to acsd that can be updated in the event that future facility or process improvements are implemented  and c a new minimum order requirement structure based on a percentage of our cubicin api requirements rather than an absolute annual minimum 
the acsd inventory purchase commitments  as well as the expected payments for the reimbursement of costs related to the acsd expansion  have been translated to us dollars using the exchange rate at december  amounts paid related to the expansion at acsd are capitalized within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets until the related assets are put into service for their intended use  after which the assets will be amortized to cost of sales over their estimated useful life 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  clinical research costs  investments  property and equipment and other intangible assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  and business combinations 
i 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin in the us  revenues derived from sales of cubicin by our international distribution partners  license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaboration  license and distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and service revenues derived from our promotion and support of merrem iv in all instances  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and cubist has no further performance obligations 
us product revenues  net all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and rebates in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
instead  we maintain a drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and acute care settings 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and acute care settings purchases of our product  and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 

table of contents we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date of the product 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on estimated product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
reserves for medicaid rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks and wholesaler management fees are offset against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the years ended december   and  provisions for sales returns  chargebacks  rebates  wholesaler management fees and discounts that were offset against product revenues totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model in which we currently operate  the low level of actual product returns and chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims experienced to date  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
international product revenues we sell our product to international distribution partners based upon a transfer price arrangement that is generally established annually 
once cubist s distribution partner sells the product to a third party  we may be owed an additional payment or royalty based on a percentage of the net selling price to the third party  less the initial transfer price previously paid on such product 
under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in a refund to the distribution partner of the initial transfer price 
service revenues we promote and provide other support for merrem iv in the us pursuant to a commercial services agreement that we entered into with astrazeneca in july astrazeneca provides marketing and commercial support for merrem iv we recognize the revenues from this agreement as service revenues in our consolidated statement of income 
for the second half of and all of  the agreement established a baseline annual payment by astrazeneca to cubist of million which was pro rated for received in quarterly increments  that was adjusted up or down through a true up payment or refund at the end of the year based on actual us sales of merrem us 
table of contents exceeding or falling short of an established annual baseline sales amount  subject to a minimum annual payment of million 
for the second half of and all of  we could have also earned a percentage of the gross profit on sales exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
the revenue for any such sales over the baseline amount would have been recognized in the quarter in which astrazeneca provided us with its annual sales report 
we recognize revenues related to this agreement over each annual period of performance based on the minimum annual payment amount that we can receive under the agreement with astrazeneca 
we assess the amount of revenue we recognize at the end of each quarterly period to reflect our actual performance against the annual baseline sales amount that could not be subject to adjustment based on future quarter performance 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included in deferred revenues 
service revenues from merrem iv of million for the year ended december   represent i million related to us sales of merrem us and ii a million payment reflecting the percentage of gross profit that we received during the first quarter of for sales in exceeding the annual baseline sales amount  which was recorded in the first quarter of our service revenues from merrem iv for the year ended december   were million  which represents the pro rated annual payment earned by us in us sales of merrem us in were below the established annual sales amount 
as such we will not receive any gross profit percentage payment for sales in the first quarter of given anticipated market conditions for carbapenems and the potential impact of the june expiration of the composition of matter patent for merrem iv in the iv  we and astrazeneca entered into an amendment to the agreement in december to establish a six month baseline sales amount for with a six month baseline payment of up to million  received in quarterly increments  to be adjusted up or down by a true up payment or refund at the end of the six month period based on actual us sales of merrem us exceeding or falling short of the established six month baseline sales amount 
if the actual us sales fall short of the six month baseline sales amount  the amendment provides stepped down payments  subject to a minimum payment of million 
the amendment also provides the possibility that we will market merrem iv during the final six months of if we and astrazeneca mutually agree that the agreement should continue on acceptable terms 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach an agreement with astrazeneca to promote merrem iv after june  other revenues other revenues include revenue related to upfront license payments  license fees and milestone payments received through cubist s license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting 
license revenues non refundable license fees for out license of our technology are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement 
we recognize non refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and the fair value of cubist s undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of our performance for such undelivered items or services 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations for cubist are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are generally recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered by us 
our assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment 
if an agreement contains research and development obligations of cubist  the relevant time period for the research and development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the 
table of contents outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized and as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of research and development on a quarterly basis 
milestones revenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
contingent payments under license agreements that do not involve substantial effort on our part are not considered substantive milestones 
such payments are recognized as revenue when the contingency is met only if there are no remaining performance obligations or any remaining performance obligations are priced at fair value 
otherwise  the contingent payment is recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  basis 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements  or inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off to cost of product revenues 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable 
therefore  any such written down inventory would be sold at significantly higher margin 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as contract research organizations  or cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made by us for research and development activities  including clinical research activities  until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of each study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in each study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically 
table of contents those that have a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements or that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments investments with original maturities of greater than days and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
our short term investments include bank deposits  corporate notes  us treasury securities  and us government agency securities 
long term investments include corporate notes  us treasury securities and us government agency securities  as well as auction rate securities  which are private placement  synthetic collateralized debt obligations that mature in investments are considered available for sale as of december  and  and are carried at fair value 
given the repeated failure of auctions for the auction rate securities  these investments are not considered to be liquid and are classified as long term investments as of december  and in april  we adopted accounting guidance which established a new method of recognizing and reporting other than temporary impairments for debt securities 
under this guidance  if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the measurement date and the entity intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  the entire impairment is considered other than temporary and is recognized in other income expense 
otherwise  the impairment should be separated into an amount relating to the credit loss and an amount relating to all other factors  or non credit loss 
the other than temporary impairment relating to the credit loss is recognized in other income expense  representing the difference between amortized cost and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected 
any non credit loss is recognized  in certain circumstances  within equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable income taxes 
see note e  investments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity  except in certain circumstances  including unrealized credit losses related to an other than temporary impairment 
realized gains and losses  dividends and interest income  including declines in value judged to be other than temporary credit losses are included in other income expense 
amortization of any premium or discount arising at purchase is included in interest income 
v 
property and equipment and other intangible assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which range from three years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building located at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the 
table of contents straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from four years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition 
vi 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a deferred tax asset is established for the expected future benefit of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets is required if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of a standard which clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
this standard also provides guidance on the derecognition of previously recognized income tax items  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and financial statement disclosure 
under this standard  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax 
interest and penalty charges  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   we did not have any interest or penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions 
vii 
stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based employee compensation  including restricted stock units  over the employees service periods  which are generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the stock based award and expected forfeiture rates 
the fair value of each stock based award is expensed under the accelerated method for option grants prior to the first quarter of and under the straight line method for option grants commencing in the first quarter of in order to determine the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  estimated option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the expected stock price volatility 
table of contents and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current and historical volatilities of our stock  which are obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of stock based pre vesting cancellations 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred stock based compensation costs of million  million and million  respectively 
viii 
business combinations on december   we acquired calixa for total consideration of million  consisting of a cash payment of million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million 
we allocated the value of the purchase price of million to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the total fair value of consideration transferred and the purchase price relates to million of charges primarily related to stock based compensation recognized in the postcombination period ended december   resulting from the settlement of calixa s unvested equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement 
the total million charge was comprised of million of research and development expense and million of general and administrative expense 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million was allocated to goodwill 
this goodwill primarily relates to a potential future tax benefit related to acquired ipr d assets 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition in thousands december  cash investments ipr d deferred tax assets goodwill other assets acquired total assets acquired other liabilities assumed deferred tax liabilities total liabilities assumed total purchase price ipr d the intangible assets identified of million are ipr d assets relating to the drug candidate cxa for pneumonia and cuti ciai indications 
cxa is an intravenously administered combination of calixa s novel antipseudomonal cephalosporin  cxa  and the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam 
cxa is currently in phase clinical trials for cuti 
cxa is being 
table of contents developed as a first line therapy for the treatment of certain serious gram negative bacterial infections in the hospital  including those caused by mdr pseudomonas aeruginosa 
pan resistant p 
aeruginosa resistant in vitro to all groups of antibiotics is a major cause of opportunistic infections among immunocompromised patients 
we anticipate advancing the clinical program for cuti and complicated intra abdominal infection  or ciai  in the first half of the next study in the cuti program would take into consideration the results of the ongoing cuti trial with cxa and  in addition  a phase trial of cxa for ciai is expected to begin in the first half of we also expect to begin lung pharmacokinetic studies of cxa for hospital acquired pneumonia and ventilator associated pneumonia in the second half of cxa for pneumonia had an estimated fair value of million and for cuti ciai had an estimated fair value of million as of the acquisition date 
we did not attribute value to the cxa compound alone because we currently do not believe that  acting alone  it has the efficacy profile to obtain approval from applicable regulatory agencies 
we assessed the fair value of ipr d assets using an income method approach  including discounted cash flow models that are probability adjusted for assumptions relating to the development and potential commercialization of cxa for the indications described above 
the valuation model used to estimate the fair values of cxa indications reflects significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate a drug development asset  including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval  market size and market growth projections  estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to advance cxa to commercialization  estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and a discount rate of 
the use of different assumptions or changes in assumptions used could result in materially different fair values 
upon acquisition  ipr d assets are recorded at their acquisition date fair value 
until the underlying project is completed  the carrying value of the ipr d is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
if a project becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the ipr d is written down to its revised fair value with the related impairment charge recognized in the period in which the impairment occurs 
if the fair value of cxa in the indications described above becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable data from any ongoing or future clinical trial or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing cxa for any of these indications  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the intangible assets will be tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present  using projected discounted cash flow models 
post acquisition research and development expenses related to the in process research and development projects will be expensed as incurred 
development of cxa for the indications described above requires various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it could be commercialized in the us or other territories 
the estimated cost to advance cxa to commercialization ranges from million to million for the cuti ciai indications and from million to million for the pneumonia indication 
these amounts represent management s best estimate of expected costs  but are subject to change given the stage of development of cxa and additional information to be received as development activities advance 
we expect to file a new drug application  or nda  for the cuti ciai indication by the end of  and a supplemental nda for the pneumonia indication during we expect to commercially launch as promptly as commercially practicable after necessary regulatory approvals are received 
assuming a traditional timeline for the regulatory review process  we expect to commercially launch cxa in cuti ciai in and in the pneumonia indication in the successful development of new pharmaceutical products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
given these uncertainties  there can be no assurance that cxa will be successfully developed for these 
table of contents indications or  if successfully developed  that it will be developed in the timeframes described above or within the cost ranges described above 
if such development is not successful or completed in a timely manner or is more expensive than currently anticipated  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for cxa or for the calixa acquisition as a whole 
contingent consideration the undiscounted contingent consideration amounts ultimately paid relating to our acquisition of calixa range from zero to million 
the fair value of this contingent consideration liability was estimated to be million as of the date of acquisition and as of december  we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration based on a probability weighted income approach 
this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represents a level measurement within the fair value hierarchy 
see note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of fair value 
the contingencies for consideration include development  regulatory and sales milestones for cxa indications 
the valuation of contingent consideration takes into account various assumptions  including the probabilities associated with successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval  the period in which these milestones are achieved  as well as a discount rate of  which represents a pre tax working capital rate 
the valuation was developed using assumptions we believe would be made by a market participant 
estimates will be assessed on an on going basis as additional data impacting the assumptions is obtained 
the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to updated assumptions and estimates will be recognized within the consolidated statements of income as other income expense 
goodwill goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
various analyses  assumptions and estimates were made as of the date of acquisition of calixa in determining the value of goodwill 
when we perform impairment tests in future years  changes in forecasts and estimates from those used at the acquisition date could result in impairment charges that would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income at that time 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an amendment to the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment details additional disclosures on fair value measurements  requires a gross presentation of activities within a level rollforward  and adds a new requirement to disclosure transfers in and out of level and level measurements 
the new disclosures are required of all entities that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this amendment is effective in the first interim or reporting period beginning after december   with an exception for the gross presentation of level rollforward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and for interim reporting periods within those years 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for own share lending arrangements in contemplation of convertible debt issuance or other financing 
this amendment clarifies how an entity should account for an agreement between a company share lender and an investment bank share borrower under which the company loans shares of its stock to the investment bank  enabling the investment bank to use the shares to enter into equity derivative contracts with the ultimate investors of the convertible debt 
under the amendment  at the date of issuance  the share lending arrangement is required to be measured at fair value and recognized as a debt issuance cost in the financial statements of the entity 
the debt issuance cost should be amortized under the effective 
table of contents interest method over the life of the financing arrangement as interest cost 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this amendment requires retrospective application for all arrangements outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is initially applied 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amendment provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated  and how the consideration paid should be allocated 
as a result of this amendment  entities may be able to separate multiple deliverable arrangements in more circumstances than under existing accounting guidance 
this guidance amends the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services based on objective evidence and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the existing guidance previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item reflect the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this amendment will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption and retrospective application is also permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this amendment on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities  or vies 
this amendment requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary  or consolidator  of a vie based on whether the entity i has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie  and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the amendment changes the consideration of kick out rights in determining if an entity is a vie and requires an ongoing reconsideration of both whether an entity is a vie and of the primary beneficiary 
this amendment is effective as of january   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the amendment requires companies to reassess  under the amended requirements  arrangements existing on or before the effective date of the amendment that may fit within its scope and requires retrospective application 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this amendment but do not expect it will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment seeks to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
additionally  on and after the effective date  this amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
this amendment is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  which may include bank deposits  money market instruments  securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and auction rate securities 
these investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  with limited investments denominated in euros 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
in addition  we have experienced liquidity issues related to our investments in auction rate securities 
we currently own securities that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective in managing our cash is to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive securities are held for trading purposes 
we currently hold auction rate securities with an original par value of million  consisting of private placement  synthetic collateralized debt obligations 
we classified the auction rate securities  which mature in  as long term investments for the years ended december  and  as we no longer consider them liquid given repeated failed auctions since august we classify these securities as available for sale and carry them at fair market value 
the decline in the financial markets has impacted the fair value of our auction rate securities 
in addition  liquidity continues to be impacted by the extremely limited market for these securities 
we estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities to be million as of december  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on the auction rate securities based on our assessment that it is unlikely that the fair market value of the auction rate securities will fully recover in the foreseeable future 
the other than temporary impairment charge of million was recorded as other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   and did not have a material impact on our financial flexibility or stability 
in april  we adopted recently issued accounting guidance which established a new method of recognizing and reporting other than temporary impairments for debt securities 
pursuant to the adoption of this guidance  we reviewed all previously recorded other than temporary impairments of securities as of april   and estimated that million of the million other than temporary impairment recognized in represented a credit loss 
we determined that the remaining million in previously recognized other than temporary impairment was due to non credit related factors  which are now required  in certain circumstances  to be included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result  we reclassified  through a cumulative effect adjustment  from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of april   million of the million other than temporary impairment charge that we recognized in the potential change in the fair value of our fixed rate investments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a decrease in fair value of million on our fixed rate investments 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse basis point movement in our auction rate securities would result in no additional loss in fair value due to the fact that our investment return is based on a floating libor rate 
in addition to interest risk  we are subject to liquidity and credit risk as it relates to these investments 
our fixed rate notes are carried at cost  net of a debt discount  on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the fair value of the notes was estimated by us to be million 
we determined the estimated fair value of the notes by using quoted market rates 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our long term debt would decrease approximately million
