our fiscal year ends on the last day of february  fiscal  for example  refers to our fiscal year ended february  overview we are a leading provider of on demand optimization solutions to retailers and consumer products  or cp  companies 
our software services enable retailers and cp companies to separately or collaboratively define category  brand  and customer strategies based on a scientific understanding of consumer behavior and make actionable pricing  promotion  assortment  space and other merchandising and marketing recommendations to achieve their revenue  profitability  sales volume  and customer loyalty objectives 
we deliver our applications by means of a software as a service  or saas  model  which allows us to capture and analyze the most recent retailer and market level data and enhance our software services rapidly to address our customers ever changing merchandising and marketing needs  and connect retailers and cp companies via collaborative  internet based applications 
during fiscal  we introduced our nextgen strategy  which combines category  brand and shopper insights to provide our retail customers a unified understanding of shopper behavior and the ability to leverage those insights to make better business decisions on pricing  promotion  assortment and collaboration with their cp trading partners 
our solutions consist of software services and complementary analytical services and analytical insights derived from the same platform that supports our software services 
we offer our solutions individually or as a suite of integrated software services 
our solutions for the retail and cp industries include demandtec lifecycle price optimization tm  demandtec end to end promotion management tm  demandtec assortment space tm  demandtec targeted marketing tm  and demandtec trade effectiveness tm 
the demandtec tradepoint network tm connects our solutions for the retail and cp industries 
we sell our solutions through our direct sales force and receive a number of customer prospect introductions through third parties  such as systems integrators and a data syndication company 
we were incorporated in november and began selling our software in fiscal our revenue has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our operating expenses have also increased significantly during these same periods 
we have incurred losses to date and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at february  we sell our software to retailers and cp companies under agreements with initial terms that generally are one to three years in length and provide a variety of services associated with our customers use of our software 
our software service agreements with retailers and cp companies are often large contracts 
the annual contract value 
table of contents for each retail and cp company customer agreement is largely related to the size of the customer 
these retail and cp customer agreements can create significant variability in the aggregate annual contract value of customer agreements signed in any given fiscal quarter 
our advanced deal management agreements with cp companies that leverage the demandtec tradepoint network are principally one year in length and much smaller in annual and aggregate contract value than our other cp company customer software services contracts and our retail contracts 
generally  the agreements we have signed in the first fiscal quarter of a fiscal year have had an aggregate annual contract value less than that of the agreements signed in the preceding fiscal fourth quarter 
in addition  the aggregate contract value of agreements signed can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis within any given fiscal year 
a significant percentage of our new and existing customer add on agreements are entered into during the last month  weeks  or even days of each quarter end 
we generally recognize the revenue we generate from each agreement ratably over the term of the agreement 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues depends on our attracting new customers  renewing agreements with our existing customers at comparable prices  and selling add on software services to existing customers  as well as the success of our nextgen strategy 
further  our revenue will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our software in the marketplace  as well as the timing  size and term length of our customer agreements 
if we are unable to successfully develop or acquire new software and enhance our existing applications  including solutions underlying our nextgen strategy  we may not be able to attract and retain customers or increase or maintain our revenue 
during fiscal and  the global economic environment deteriorated and resulted in delays in the execution of new and some renewal customer contracts  with some customers or potential customers electing not to enter into new or renewal contracts  and some other customers renewing at lower prices or for shorter contract periods 
accordingly  our revenue growth has slowed and deferred revenue balances have decreased 
in the fiscal quarter ended february   our revenue declined from the preceding quarter and we expect our revenue to further decline in our first quarter of fiscal ending may  compared to the quarter ended february  in the near term  we expect that our revenue growth may continue to slow  or revenue itself may decline from prior periods 
in addition  the impact of the adverse economic environment on our business contributed to the use of approximately million of cash in operations in fiscal our cash flow generation will continue to remain challenging and unpredictable and  consequently  we may continue to use cash in operations in future periods 
we have not seen any noticeable improvement in sales cycles and we currently have little evidence to suggest that the impact of the global economic environment will improve in the near term 
furthermore  our ability to achieve profitability will be affected by our revenue as well as our other operating expenses associated with growing our business 
our largest category of operating expenses is research and development expenses  and the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
we are headquartered in san mateo  california  and have sales and marketing offices in north america and europe 
we sell our software through our direct sales force and receive a number of customer prospect introductions through third parties  such as systems integrators and a data syndication company 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was attributable to sales of our software to companies located in the united states 
in september  we entered into a lease agreement for office space in san mateo  california that we use as our new corporate headquarters  replacing our then existing corporate headquarters in san carlos  california 
the lease has a total lease term of eight years with an initial non cancellable lease term of five years commencing december  the aggregate minimum lease commitment is approximately million 
upon commencement of this lease  our monthly rent payments increased significantly both immediately and in the long term over our monthly rent payments for our prior space  and quarterly real estate related operating expenses that we incur increased by approximately  if our revenue does not increase or our other operating expenses do not decrease to offset this increase in real estate related operating expenses  or if we are unable to find suitable tenants to sublease a significant portion of this space in the event we are unable to sufficiently grow our business in the future  then our results of operations and financial position will be materially adversely impacted 
in february  we acquired connect systems  inc  a provider of advertising planning and execution software for million 
the connect product suite  which connect offered on an installed  behind the firewall basis  is being replatformed into the demandtec end to end promotion management tm solution  which supports retailers end to end promotion planning process 
in fiscal  we paid million of the acquisition 
table of contents consideration as well as million of assumed notes payable held by a former connect officer  and we recorded approximately million of amortization expense associated with connect s purchased intangible assets 
during fiscal  we recorded approximately  of expense associated with the reduction of our workforce as a result of synergies gained through the acquisition of connect and with the consolidation and relocation of our corporate headquarters 
as of april   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  excluding approximately million shares subject to outstanding options  performance stock units and restricted stock units 
the issuance of shares upon the exercise of these options and settlement of these units  as well as the grant of additional options and units pursuant to our equity compensation plans  would result in additional dilution and may adversely impact our earnings per share 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenue we derive all of our revenue from customer agreements that cover the use of our software and various services associated with our customers use of our software 
we generally recognize all revenue ratably over the term of the agreement 
our agreements are generally non cancellable  but customers typically have the right to terminate their agreement for cause if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement and  in certain situations  may have the ability to extend the duration of their agreement on pre negotiated terms 
we invoice our customers in accordance with contractual terms  which generally provide that our customers are invoiced in advance for annual use of our software 
we generally provide certain implementation services on a fixed fee basis and invoice our customers in advance

we amortize purchased intangible assets  principally for developed technology acquired in prior acquisitions 
we allocate overhead costs  such as rent and occupancy costs  employee benefits  information management costs  and legal and other costs  to all departments predominantly based on headcount

amortization of purchased intangible assets in february  we acquired connect the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  which consisted of approximately million in cash and  of acquisition costs 
we are amortizing purchased intangible assets related to developed technology  customer relationships  non compete covenants and backlog over one to two and a half years on a straight line basis  which resulted in approximately million of amortization expense in fiscal annual amortization expenses related to this acquisition  absent any impairment  will be approximately million and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in may  we purchased rights to develop assortment optimization technology for million  which was amortized over months on a straight line basis and was fully amortized at february  this resulted in approximately  of amortization expense in fiscal  which was included in our operating expenses 
in november  we acquired tradepoint 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  which consisted of approximately million in cash  approximately million in our common stock  a million promissory note and  of acquisition costs 
in this acquisition  we purchased intangible assets related to developed technology  customer relationships  a trade name  and non compete covenants 
we have been amortizing purchased intangible assets over three to ten years on a straight line basis 
this resulted in approximately  of amortization expense in fiscal annual amortization expenses related to this acquisition  absent any impairment  will be approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively  and will decline significantly thereafter 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income on our cash and marketable securities balances  interest expense related to debt  and losses or gains on conversions of non us dollar transactions into us dollars 
in the past three fiscal years  we have invested a majority of our cash in money market funds  treasury bills  corporate bonds  obligations of government sponsored enterprises  and commercial paper 
in the first half of fiscal the period preceding our ipo before our convertible preferred stock was automatically converted to common stock  other income expense  net included the impact of recording our outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants at fair value 
in fiscal and thereafter  other income expense  net will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to generate cash from operations  interest rates and the rates of return on our investments  foreign exchange rates  and whether or not we incur debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
these accounting principles often require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
in some cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application or our judgments in selecting among available accounting policy alternatives  as they would not produce a materially different result 
in other cases  our judgments among available alternatives can have a material impact on our accounting results 
we believe that our estimates and judgments were reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments were made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in
