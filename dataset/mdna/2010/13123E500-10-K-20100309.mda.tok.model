item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results we are a market and technology leader in sales performance management spm software solutions designed to align internal sales resources and distribution channels with corporate strategy 
our software enhances core processes in sales management  such as the structuring of sales territories  the management of sales force talent  the establishment of sales targets and the creation and execution of sales incentive plans 
using our spm software solutions  companies can tailor these core processes to further their strategic objectives  including coordinating sales efforts with long range strategies regarding sales and margin targets  growth initiatives  sales force talent development  territory expansion and market penetration 
our customers can also use our spm solutions to address more tactical objectives  such as successful new product launches and effective cross selling strategies 
leading companies worldwide in the financial services  insurance  communications  high technology  life sciences and retail industries rely on our solutions for their sales performance management and incentive compensation needs 
our spm solutions can be purchased and delivered as either an on demand service or an on premise software solution 
our on demand service allows customers to use our software products through a web interface rather than purchase computer equipment and install our software at their locations  and we believe the benefits of this deployment method will make our on demand offering our most popular product choice 
we sell our products and services both directly through our sales force and in conjunction with our strategic partners 
we also offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
we generate recurring subscription and support revenues from our on demand service  support and maintenance agreements associated with our product licenses and  beginning in the third quarter of  we introduced on premise licenses of our software as a time based term license arrangement  all of which is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
transition to recurring revenue model completed in  we effectively completed the transition to our recurring revenue business model from a perpetual license business model 
our financial results for reflected our progress in the transition during the past year 
recurring revenues for were million  up over as a percentage of total revenues  recurring revenues accounted for  up from for our progress in the transition to a recurring revenue business model is better illustrated in the comparison between the fourth quarters of and recurring revenues accounted for of total revenues in the fourth quarter of  an increase from in the fourth quarter of we expect recurring revenues to run at approximately of total revenues through a key metric in our recurring revenue business model is additions to net annual contract value acv generated from the sale of our on demand and time based term license offerings 
our net acv increased by million or during to million in cumulative net acv at the end of because of the move to a recurring revenue model  the full impact of the acv bookings during will generally be recognized ratably over the next year 
as a result of the contractual terms in some of our customer agreements  revenue related to new acv bookings may be deferred until a customer goes live 
total revenues for the year were million  down million or from the prior year 
this decrease was the result of the anticipated decrease in license and services revenues related to our business model change  combined with a very challenging economic environment 
total license revenue for the year was million  a decrease of million from services revenue decreased by from million in to 
table of contents million in the shift in revenue mix from perpetual license revenue to more predictable recurring revenue has also resulted in reduced services revenue as expected  as the average implementation time for a recurring revenue arrangement is significantly less than under the perpetual license model 
alignment of cost base with recurring revenue model during the past year of our transition to a recurring revenue business model  we aggressively reduced our operating expenses to better align our cost base with our recurring revenue streams 
our operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the significant decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of cost saving actions including reduction in staff taken throughout as a result of reductions in workforce  we recorded charges of approximately million in compared to million in we expect to realize additional savings in related to these and further actions 
with our plans to transfer more of our development efforts to offshore resources and relocate our headquarters in  we will make further progress toward aligning our cost base with our recurring revenue streams and achieving profitability 
immaterial adjustments to previously released financial results subsequent to the filing of our form k on january   which included our press release containing our december  unaudited financial statements  we made immaterial adjustments to our fiscal financial statements which had the effect of increasing net loss by approximately  these adjustments are not material to either the annual or fourth quarter financial statements for the period ended december  other business highlights on january   we completed the acquisition of actek 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid actek s owner million in a combination of cash and stock and assumed debt of million 
in addition  we may pay up to approximately million in the form of cash  restricted stock units and stock options  depending on the achievement of specified operational milestones on january  because this consideration is contingent on the achievement of the milestones  we are required to revalue the consideration at each subsequent reporting date until january  under the acquisition accounting guidance 
actek is a leading provider of commissions and compliance software for complex selling environments for the insurance and financial services industries 
challenges and risks in response to market demand  we shifted our primary business focus from the sale of perpetual licenses for our products to the provision of our software as a service through our on demand offering 
our saas model also provides more predictable quarterly revenues for us 
in  as our on demand business has begun to mature and we faced challenging macro economic conditions  the growth rate of our new on demand acv bookings has slowed and we have begun to experience some attrition 
as a result  the overall net acv growth rate in was lower than in prior years 
as a further step in our transition to a recurring revenue business model  in the third quarter of we began offering our on premise products as a time based term license arrangement 
we believe this offering will better address the needs of our customers that prefer our on premise solution  and provide us with more predictable revenue streams than perpetual on premise licenses 
while we have sold on premise time based term licenses during the second half of  there is no assurance that this new offering will achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable to significantly grow our recurring revenue business or continue to provide our on demand services on a consistently profitable basis in the future  our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
costs associated with supporting our on demand offering are generally higher than the cost of maintenance related to our on premise customers 
in addition to providing customer support that is included in our maintenance offering  we are responsible for the full operation of the software that the customer has contracted for in our hosting facility 
additionally  some of our on demand customers subscribe to additional services available through our business operations offering that result in additional costs 

table of contents our transition to a recurring revenue model has accelerated the anticipated decline in services revenues  as implementations of our on demand offering generally are faster and require lower customer investment than our on premise business 
we do not expect our services revenues and margins to return to historical levels  and have taken steps to better align our costs to anticipated revenues 
however  there is no assurance that the steps we have taken  or may take in the future  will be adequate 
if they are not  our overall gross margins and our ability to achieve or sustain profitability will be adversely affected 
in july in connection with our transition to a recurring revenue business model  we reorganized our sales organization and marketing department to more effectively focus on our market opportunity and at the same time took other significant actions to reduce costs 
if these steps prove insufficient or ineffective or result in unanticipated disruption to our business  our ability to achieve or sustain profitability may be materially impaired 
from a business perspective  we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  however  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our transactions and the timing of revenue recognition resulting from greater flexibility in contract terms 
we believe one of our major remaining challenges is increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products and services over competing it projects 
to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our on demand services  and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our suite of products 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from sales of our products and services to customers in the financial and insurance industries 
the recent substantial disruptions in these industries have resulted and may in the future result in these customers deferring or cancelling future planned expenditures on our products and services 
further  consolidations and business failures in these industries could result in substantially reduced demand for our products and services 
in addition  the disruptions in these industries and the concurrent international financial crisis may cause other potential customers to defer or cancel future purchases of our products and services as they seek to conserve resources in the face of economic turmoil and the drastically reduced availability of capital in the equity and debt markets 
any of these developments  or the combination of these developments  may materially and adversely affect our revenues  operating results and financial condition in future periods 
if we are unable to grow our revenues  we may be unable to achieve and sustain profitability 
in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve  stock based compensation  goodwill impairment  long lived asset impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially 
table of contents from actual results 
for a more detailed discussion of these accounting policies and our use of estimates  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
we generally warrant that our services will be performed in accordance with the criteria agreed upon in a statement of work  which we generally execute with each applicable customer prior to commencing work 
should these services not be performed in accordance with the agreed upon criteria  we typically provide remediation services until such time as the criteria are met 
management must use judgments and make estimates of service remediation reserves related to potential future requirements to provide remediation services in connection with current period service revenues 
when providing for service remediation reserves  we analyze historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues if  for any period  actual remediation claims differ from management s judgments or estimates 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected term of the options  taking into account projected exercises  our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends  which we determine as follows expected term is determined based on historical experience  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility over the expected term 
risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term 

table of contents estimated forfeitures are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option forfeitures 
expected dividends are estimated at zero based on our history and intentions of not declaring and paying dividends 
changes in these variables could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and thus could materially affect our operating results 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors  including industry and economic trends and changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined there was no impairment 
we currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the assets to be held and used based on the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
upon classification of long lived assets as held for sale  such assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and we cease further depreciation or amortization 
accounting for income taxes income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  
table of contents judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables  where certain of those deliverables are non software related 
the new standards permit entities to initially use management s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have vsoe of fair value or when third party evidence is not available 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for annual periods ending after june   however early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these new standards on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  including possible early adoption 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of newly adopted accounting pronouncements on our financial statements

table of contents revenues recurring revenues 
recurring revenues  consisting of on demand arrangements  time based on premise arrangements and maintenance revenues  increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in subscription revenues related to on demand and business operations services in this increase was attributable to the increase in the number of existing on demand customers for which we recognized revenue as all elements of the related customer contracts began to be performed during compared to we introduced our time based term license offering in the third quarter of total revenue generated from this new offering was million during support revenues for maintenance services decreased by million in compared to  which was primarily a result of a number of on premise customers converting to our on demand service and decreased perpetual license sales to new customers 
services revenues 
services revenues decreased by million or in compared to the decrease was primarily a result of combined effect of shorter on demand implementation time  the challenging economic environment and reduced on premise license sales 
services revenue for benefitted from a one time fee of approximately million paid to us by two of our customers that were acquired and subsequently terminated our services 
license revenues 
perpetual license revenues decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to our transition from a perpetual license business to a recurring revenue saas oriented company 
as a result  our license business diminished in importance in the past year and we do not expect perpetual license revenue to return to historical levels 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of recurring revenues 
cost of recurring revenues increased by million or in compared to the increase was primarily due to increased cost of fulfilling higher level of customer orders resulting from the increase in on demand subscription revenue  increased amortization of intangible assets resulting from higher cost of third party technology used in our products  the allocation of a relatively greater portion of such amortization expense to the cost of recurring revenues as such revenues compose a greater portion of total revenues and  in certain periods  increased labor and infrastructure costs associated with customers going live with our on demand offering 
the costs associated with supporting our on demand offering are generally higher than the cost of maintenance related to our on premise customers  as we are responsible for the full operation of the software that the customer has contracted for in our hosting facility 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues decreased by million or in compared to the decrease was attributable to the decrease in related services revenues as discussed above and decreases in personnel and subcontractor costs 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased by million or in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of our transition to a recurring revenue business 
as a result of the transition  we have allocated to the cost of license revenues a lower portion of the amortization expense for intangible assets comprised of third party technology used in our products 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased to in from in this was primarily a result of our business model shifting to on demand from perpetual license sales  which historically has had a higher margin 
our recurring revenue gross margin declined from in to in the decrease was primarily due to the increase in higher cost on demand revenue and additional costs  including the amortization expense for intangible assets comprised of third party technology used in our products and costs associated with customers going live  as discussed above 
we expect our overall recurring revenue margin to fluctuate  but trend upwards in future periods as we realize the full quarter benefit of our recent cost cutting actions as well as anticipated efficiencies over the longer term 

table of contents services gross margin increased from in to in the increase was primarily due to the progress we made during the first half of the year to improve utilization 
services gross margin was adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of as a result of lower than planned utilization and a decrease in our average billing rate 
while we expect improvement in our services margin in  we do not expect it to return to the levels it was under our perpetual license model 
license gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in license gross margin reflects the lower license revenue offset against the fixed cost of license generated by the amount of intangible assets amortization allocated to license sales

sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in personnel costs of million due to reductions in headcount and a decrease in commission payments of million resulting from decreased perpetual license sales 
the decrease was also driven by a decrease in partner selling fees of million  a decrease in travel costs of million  and a decrease in stock based compensation as discussed below 
the reductions in commission expenses are  in part  reflective of the shift of our business focus to our on demand offering and away from the license model 
for financial reporting purposes  commission expenses associated with on demand arrangements are deferred and then amortized over the non cancelable term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized  whereas commission expenses related to perpetual license sales are incurred in the period the transaction occurs 
commission expenses associated with the new time based licenses will have the same treatment as commission expenses associated with on demand arrangements 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs of million due to the reductions in headcount and a decrease in stock based compensation as discussed below  partially offset by an increase in professional fees of million for costs related to our offshore resource center

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is also a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
see note investments of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our auction rate securities 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain auction rate securities  and we invest in investment grade securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our investment portfolios  which is approved by our board of directors 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk are short term investments  long term investments and trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we mitigate market risk by monitoring ratings  credit spreads and potential downgrades for all bank counterparties on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our on going assessment of counterparty risk  we will adjust our exposure to various counterparties 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  certificates of deposit  high quality corporate debt obligations  united states government obligations  auction rate securities and the related put option asset 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  which typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately months  and all investment securities other than auction rate securities had maturities of less than months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments except for auction rate securities at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity total total year more than principal fair or less year amount value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to interest rate risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money 
therefore  we currently have no exposure to interest rate risk related to debt instruments 
to the extent we enter into or issue debt instruments in the future  we will have interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our non united states operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for our operations outside the united states  we transact business generally in various other currencies 
for  approximately of our total revenue was denominated in foreign currency 
at december   approximately of our total accounts receivable was denominated in foreign currency 
our exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
the overall decrease in revenue for as compared to reflects a million adverse effect due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we expect to continue to transact a majority of our business in us dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million notional amount of outstanding short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to customer payments denominated in mexican pesos mxn 

table of contents we had million of losses related to forward exchange contracts for we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the immediate future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our foreign exchange rate contract investment strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows
