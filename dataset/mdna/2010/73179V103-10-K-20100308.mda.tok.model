please see forward looking statements for more information 
you should review the risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading global high technology filtration company that develops  manufactures and markets specialized microporous membranes used in separation and filtration processes 
in fiscal  we generated total net sales of million 
we operate in two business segments i the energy storage segment  which accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales  and ii the separations media segment  which accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales 
we manufacture our products at facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from foreign locations were million for fiscal energy storage segment in the energy storage segment  our membrane separators are a critical performance component in lithium batteries  which are primarily used in consumer electronics and electric drive vehicle edv applications  and lead acid batteries  which are used globally in transportation and numerous industrial applications 
we believe the global economic recession adversely impacted sales in and may continue to have an adverse impact in the near future 
although the short term economic outlook is uncertain  we believe that the long term growth drivers for the energy storage business growth in asia  increasing demand for consumer electronics and the emergence of edv applications remain intact 
we have and will continue to position ourselves to capitalize on these future growth opportunities 
lithium batteries are the power source in a wide variety of electronics applications ranging from notebook computers and mobile phones to cordless power tools 
in addition to consumer electronics applications  development and investment in lithium batteries for use in edv applications is accelerating 
in late  we completed a lithium battery separator capacity expansion at our charlotte  nc facility 
in late  we initiated a million expansion aimed at enhancing our 
table of contents position as a market leader in supplying lithium separators for edv applications 
the expansion will be partially funded by a million grant from the us department of energy doe and includes the existing charlotte  nc facility and construction of a new manufacturing facility in concord  nc  which is expected to begin in the second half of in  we acquired a lithium battery separator company in south korea which was subsequently renamed celgard korea  inc in early  we initiated a million capacity expansion at this facility to serve growth in consumer electronics applications in asia 
in the lead acid battery market  the high proportion of aftermarket replacement sales and the steady growth of the worldwide fleet of motor vehicles provide us with a growing recurring revenue base in lead acid battery separators 
worldwide demand for lead acid battery separators is expected to continue to grow at slightly more than annual economic growth 
the asia pacific region is the fastest growing market for lead acid battery separators 
growth in this region is driven by the increasing penetration of automobile ownership  growth in industrial and manufacturing sectors  export incentives and ongoing conversion to the polyethylene based membrane separators we produce 
we have positioned ourselves to benefit from growth in asia by expanding capacity at our prachinburi  thailand facility  acquiring the remaining minority interest in our production facility in tianjin  china and establishing an asian technical center in thailand 
in addition  on april   we acquired the battery separator manufacturing assets of super tech battery components pvt 
ltd  located in bangalore  india 
in  we will expand out operations in india 
we will continue to focus our resources and assets to capitalize on growth in this important region 
the north american market for lead acid battery separators is characterized by relatively low growth and excess capacity 
as a result of these factors and management estimates of future demand  we implemented a restructuring plan to idle capacity at our manufacturing facility in owensboro  kentucky 
a supply agreement for lead acid battery separators with exide technologies exide  a customer of our energy storage segment  expired on december  on january   we announced a new multi year supply agreement with exide where we will supply the majority of exide s lead acid separators on a global basis 
in february  we purchased of the stock of microporous holding corporation  the parent company of microporous products lp microporous 
the acquisition of microporous adds rubber based battery separator technology to our product line 
separations media segment in the separations media segment  our filtration membranes and modules are used in healthcare and high performance filtration and specialty applications 
the healthcare business and a portion of the filtration and specialty business have historically been relatively unaffected by the economy  and we believe that the separations media segment will continue to benefit from continued growth in demand for higher levels of purity in a growing number of applications 
healthcare applications include hemodialysis  blood oxygenation  and plasmapheresis 
growth in demand for hemodialysis membranes is driven by the increasing worldwide population of end stage renal disease patients 
we estimate that conversion to single use dialyzers and increasing treatment frequency will result in additional dialyzer market growth 
we produce a wide range of membranes and membrane based elements for micro  ultra and nanofiltration and gasification degasification of liquids 
micro  ultra and nanofiltration membrane element market growth is being driven by several factors  including end market growth in applications such as water treatment and pharmaceutical processing  displacement of conventional filtration media 
table of contents by membrane filtration due to membranes superior cost and performance attributes and increasing purity requirements in industrial and other applications 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on past experience and management s judgment 
because of uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are primarily composed of amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we charge accounts receivables off against our allowance for doubtful accounts when we deem them to be uncollectible on a specific identification basis 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to judgment and estimated by management 
if circumstances or economic conditions deteriorate  we may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of intangibles and goodwill identified intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process performed at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
step one compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the income approach  corroborated by comparison to market capitalization and key multiples of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one 
in this step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  strategic plans and future market conditions  among others 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not 
table of contents achieved or changes in strategy or market conditions occur  the company may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
we completed our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million for our lead acid reporting unit of the energy storage segment 
at the date of our annual impairment test  a and decrease in the estimated free cash flow assumptions for the lead acid reporting unit would have increased the impairment charge by million and million  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have increased the impairment charge by million 
we determined that the estimated fair value of our other reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying amounts  and a decrease in fair value for each of these reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
pension and other postretirement benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement and differences between actual results and these two actuarial assumptions can materially affect our projected benefit obligation or the valuation of our plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  expected increases in compensation  mortality and turnover 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate assumptions are based on the market rate for high quality fixed income investments  and are thus subject to change each year 
at january   a decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations and the unfunded status of our pension plans by million 
the expected rates of return on our pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
for  if the expected rate of return on pension plan assets were reduced by  the result would have increased our net periodic benefit expense for fiscal by million 
at january   if the actual plan assets were reduced by  the unfunded status of our pension plans would increase by million 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations  and the availability and application of technology 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to recognize additional expense and liabilities 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana gmbh membrana in  we recorded a reserve for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades at the wuppertal  germany facility 
in  we identified and accrued for potential environmental contamination at our manufacturing facility in potenza  italy 
in december  we implemented a restructuring plan which included the closure of this manufacturing facility and increased the environmental reserve for the 
table of contents estimated additional costs of environmental remediation and monitoring activities that will be required after closing the facility 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis ag acordis and akzo nobel ag akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
we have recorded a receivable with regard to the akzo indemnification agreement 
if indemnification claims cannot be enforced against acordis and akzo  we may be required to reduce the amount of indemnification receivable recorded

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal energy storage sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or 
lithium battery separator sales decreased by due to the impact of the weak economic environment on consumer electronics purchases 
lead acid battery separator sales decreased by  including the negative impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations of million 
the primary reason for the decline in lead acid battery separator sales in fiscal was the loss of a customer at the end of fiscal sales to this customer in fiscal were million 
in addition  demand for the company s lead acid battery separators were negatively impacted by the recent economic environment  particularly in north america and europe 
sales to our largest customer decreased approximately million in in the third and fourth quarters of  we estimate that we shipped slightly more than million of advance orders to this customer for usage and demand 
we believe these advance orders will negatively impact our lead acid battery separator sales in demand in asia  which is the fastest growing market for lead acid separators  continues to be strong as sales in this region increased in fiscal separations media sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal  including the negative impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations of million 
healthcare sales remained relatively consistent with the prior year as the impact of higher sales volumes of synthetic hemodialysis membranes was offset by the negative impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
filtration and specialty product sales decreased by due to current macro economic conditions and the negative impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal energy storage gross profit as a percent of net sales was as compared to for fiscal  which included incremental costs associated with a strike at the owensboro  kentucky lead acid battery separator facility 
excluding the strike related costs  gross profit as a percent of sales in remained relatively consistent with the prior year 
separations media gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was due primarily to production efficiencies and decreased energy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million for fiscal excluding the impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations  the decrease was million  consisting primarily of reduced discretionary spending and cost savings from the restructuring plan  partially offset by million of increased costs associated with the ftc litigation 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the lower interest rates under our senior credit facilities and positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated debt 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to a variety of factors  including state income taxes  the mix of income between us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates  changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances and the relative size of our consolidated income loss before income taxes 
the mix of earnings between the tax jurisdictions has a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
each tax jurisdiction has its own set of tax laws and tax rates and income earned by our subsidiaries is taxed independently by these various jurisdictions 
currently  the applicable statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate range from to 
therefore  the amount of income tax 
table of contents expense in each jurisdiction as compared to our consolidated income loss before income taxes has a significant impact on our annual effective tax rate 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate was also impacted by the goodwill impairment charge  which decreased pre tax income with no material corresponding income tax benefit 
the effect of each of these items on our effective tax rate on continuing operations is quantified in the table below fiscal fiscal us federal statutory rate state income taxes mix of income in taxing jurisdictions other permanent differences and valuation allowances impact of goodwill impairment impact of restructuring other total effective tax rate on continuing operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal energy storage sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or 
the increase in energy storage sales was due to higher lead acid and lithium battery separator sales and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations of million 
lead acid battery separator sales increased by  due primarily to the acquisition of microporous  as well as the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations and price increases earlier in to partially offset the escalation in raw material and energy costs 
the expiration of a lead acid separator supply contract with a customer will impact our sales for fiscal sales of automotive lead acid battery separators covered by the expired contract were approximately of fiscal consolidated net sales 
in response  we implemented a restructuring plan to align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand  reduce costs and position us to meet future growth opportunities 
lithium battery separator sales increased by due to increasing demand for mobile power and the penetration of lithium ion batteries in an increasing number of electronic devices and into new applications for large format cells 
separations media sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the increase in separations media sales was due to higher sales of industrial and filtration specialty products and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations of million 
healthcare sales were consistent with the prior year as growth in sales of synthetic hemodialysis membranes and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations offset the impact of discontinued sales of cellulosic membranes 
industrial and filtration specialty product sales increased by  driven by continued demand for high performance filtration applications and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal energy storage gross profit as a percent of net sales was as compared to for fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to the acquisition of microporous  which has lower gross profit margins than our other lead acid battery separator production facilities  increased raw material and energy costs  and costs associated with the strike at our owensboro  kentucky facility 
separations media gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased hemodialysis membrane production volumes and investments to enhance production efficiencies 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal  which is comparable to for fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by the purchase of our senior discount notes in july and lower interest rates under our senior credit facilities 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to a variety of factors  including state income taxes  the mix of income between us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates  changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances and the relative size of our consolidated income before income taxes

currently  the applicable statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate range from to 
therefore  the amount of income tax expense in each jurisdiction as compared to our consolidated income loss before income taxes has a significant impact on our annual effective tax rate 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate was also impacted by the restructuring charge in potenza  italy 
net operating losses generated in italy as a result of the restructuring charge were offset by a valuation allowance because the benefit of these net operating losses may never be realized since the company will no longer have operations in italy 
the effect of each of these items on our effective tax rate on continuing operations is quantified in the table below fiscal fiscal us federal statutory rate state income taxes mix of income in taxing jurisdictions other permanent differences and valuation allowances purchase of senior discount notes and write off of loan acquisition costs associated with refinancing of senior secured credit facility impact of restructuring other impact of italian tax reform legislation impact of german tax reform legislation total effective tax rate on continuing operations

all restructuring charges  except for the asset impairments  will result in cash outflows which will be funded by cash from operations 
we expect to make restructuring payments of million in fiscal restructuring plan 
the north american market for lead acid battery separators has significant excess capacity and a highly consolidated customer base 
in addition  demand for lead acid battery separators has continued to be negatively impacted by the recent economic environment 
as a result of these factors and our estimates based on recent discussions with customers about future 
table of contents demand requirements in north america  we implemented a restructuring plan to better align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand in north america 
the restructuring plan includes idling capacity and reducing headcount at our manufacturing facility in owensboro  kentucky 
the total estimated cost of the plan is expected to be approximately million  including estimated cash charges of million for severance and other costs and a non cash impairment charge of million for buildings and equipment 
the restructuring plan includes severance costs of approximately million  of which million was recognized in and the remainder will be recognized in we estimate that other exit costs  consisting of costs associated with idling the owensboro facility  are expected to be million  of which million has been recognized in and the remainder will be recognized over the next three years 
we began implementing the plan in the fourth quarter of and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
cash payments for severance and other exit costs are expected to be paid over the next three years 
the timing  scope and costs of the restructuring plan are subject to change as we implement the plan and continue to evaluate our business needs and costs 
restructuring plan 
a supply contract between our lead acid battery separator business and a large customer expired on december  and was not renewed 
in response  we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of for our energy storage segment to align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand  reduce costs and position ourselves to meet future growth opportunities 
the plan included closing our facility in potenza  italy  streamlining production at our facility in owensboro  kentucky and reducing selling  general and administrative resources associated with the lead acid battery separator business 
the total cost of the restructuring plan  including environmental costs recorded in the environmental reserve of million  is expected to be approximately million  of which million has been recognized 
the restructuring plan included the termination of production employees at potenza  italy and owensboro  kentucky and certain selling  general and administrative employees 
during  we reduced the estimated cost of severance and benefits and related accrual by million to reflect actual costs expected to be incurred 
after this adjustment  the total cost of severance and benefits is expected to be approximately million 
we estimate that other costs  consisting primarily of costs associated with closing the potenza  italy facility  are expected to be approximately million  of which million has been recognized through fiscal and the remainder will be recognized over the next two years 
the restructuring included a non cash impairment charge of million for buildings and machinery and equipment in potenza  italy 
cash payments for severance and other exit costs are expected to be paid over the next two years 
the timing  scope and costs of these restructuring measures are subject to change as we implement the plan and continue to evaluate our business needs and costs 
restructuring plan 
in december  our separations media segment exited the production of cellulosic membranes and we realigned the cost structure at our wuppertal  germany facility 
the total cost of the plan  all of which has been incurred  was million  consisting of a million non cash impairment charge for buildings and equipment  million for employee layoffs and million for other costs related to the shutdown of portions of the wuppertal facility 
foreign operations at january   we manufacture our products at strategically located facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from the foreign locations were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal typically  we sell our products in the currency of the country where the manufacturing facility that produces the product is located 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can 
table of contents be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
seasonality operations at our european production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations 
as a result  operating income during the third quarter of fiscal years  and were  and during the third quarter of any fiscal year in the future may be  lower than operating income in other quarters during the same fiscal year 
in view of the seasonal fluctuations  we believe that comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at january  from million at january  the million increase consists of cash flow from operations of million  cash used in investing activities of million  cash used in financing activities of million and the positive impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of million 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal consisted of cash flows from operations partially offset by an increase in working capital of million 
accounts receivable increased due to fourth quarter sales levels 
days sales outstanding were comparable to the prior year 
we have not experienced significant changes in accounts receivable aging or customer payment terms and believe that we have adequately provided for potential bad debts 
inventory and inventory days are comparable to the prior year 
we believe that inventory is consistent with expected future demand 
our inventory is generally not subject to obsolescence and does not have a shelf life and we do not believe there is a significant risk of inventory impairment 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to the timing of payments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal consisted of cash flows from operations partially offset by an increase in working capital of million 
accounts receivable decreased from fiscal year end due to fourth quarter sales levels and days sales outstanding were comparable to the prior year 
inventories increased due to timing of sales and production 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
investing activities 
capital expenditures were million  consisting primarily of normal maintenance on our existing facilities 
in late  we initiated a million expansion for lithium battery separators at our existing charlotte  nc facility and construction of a new manufacturing facility in concord  nc 
the expansion will be partially funded by a million grant from the doe 
in early  we approved a million capacity expansion at our lithium battery production facility in south korea 
we have currently approved capital spending of approximately million  net of the doe grant award for these expansions and normal maintenance activities  and will continue to evaluate investment opportunities as they arise 
financing activities 
during fiscal  we made payments of million on debt and million for the early buyout of a capital lease 
under the terms of our credit agreement  we are required to make a mandatory prepayment of term loans within ninety days of our fiscal year end 
table of contents based on a specified percentage of excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
for fiscal  we are required to make an excess cash flow payment of million by april  we intend to fund our ongoing operations with cash on hand  cash generated by operations and availability under the senior secured credit facility 
our senior secured credit facility provides for a million term loan facility million outstanding at january  and a million term loan facility million at january  and a million revolving credit facility 
at january   we had million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility million revolving credit facility less million of undrawn standby letters of credit 
the term loans mature in july and the revolving credit facility matures in july interest rates under the senior secured credit facility are  at our option  equal to either an alternate base rate plus a margin or the eurocurrency base rate plus a margin 
at january   the interest rates on the us dollar term loan and eurodollar term loan were and  respectively 
when loans are outstanding under the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a senior leverage ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda of less than to 
at january   our senior leverage ratio was  and the entire amount of the revolving credit facility was available for borrowing 
adjusted ebitda  as defined under the senior secured credit facility  was as follows in millions fiscal net loss add subtract depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income taxes stock based compensation expense foreign currency gain loss on disposal of property  plant  and equipment business restructuring goodwill impairment costs related to the ftc complaint other non cash or non recurring charges adjusted ebitda the calculation of the senior leverage ratio as defined under the senior credit facility as of january  is as follows in millions fiscal indebtedness adjusted ebitda actual leverage ratio x calculated as the sum of outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility  less the amount of cash on hand not to exceed million 
the senior secured credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit capital spending  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness  liens and encumbrances  and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the facilities also contain certain customary events of default  subject to grace periods  as appropriate 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations imposed by the senior credit facilities will not significantly inhibit us from meeting our ongoing capital expenditure needs 

table of contents future principal debt payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and future refinancing of our debt 
our cash interest requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be million 
the senior subordinated notes million outstanding at january  will mature in may and are guaranteed by most of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
except under certain circumstances  the senior subordinated notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually in cash 
the senior subordinated notes contain customary covenants and events of default  including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments 
as stated in the credit agreement  the term loans mature in july and the revolving credit facility matures in july the senior subordinated notes mature on may  because the senior subordinated notes are subordinated to the senior secured credit facility  if any amounts are outstanding under the senior subordinated notes at february   the maturity date for the term loans and the revolving credit facility will be accelerated to february  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements over both the short next twelve months and long term in relation to our debt service requirements 
in evaluating the sufficiency of our liquidity for both the shorter and longer term  we considered cash on hand  the expected cash flow to be generated by our operations and the available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility compared to our anticipated cash requirements for debt service  working capital  cash taxes and capital expenditures and funding requirements for long term liabilities 
we anticipate that our cash on hand and operating cash flow  together with borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
see item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
from time to time  we may explore additional financing methods and other means to lower our cost of capital  which could include stock issuance or debt financing and the application of the proceeds therefrom to the repayment of bank debt or other indebtedness 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
however  future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations  and the availability and application of technology 
we do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their 
table of contents receipt is deemed probable 
at january   environmental reserves  which are predominately euro denominated  were million 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
at january   the environmental reserve for the membrana facility was million 
we anticipate that expenditures will be made over the next seven to ten years 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis ag acordis and akzo nobel ag akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis s successors 
akzo s indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification payments under the indemnification agreements as expenditures are made against approved claims 
at january  amounts receivable under the indemnification agreements were million 
in  we identified potential environmental contamination at our manufacturing facility in potenza  italy 
based on environmental studies and the initial remediation plan presented to local authorities  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
in  we further refined the remediation plan after consultations with local authorities 
in december  we implemented a restructuring plan which included the closure of this manufacturing facility 
based on discussions with local authorities  environmental consultants and internal personnel  we increased the environmental reserve at potenza by million for the estimated additional costs of environmental remediation and monitoring activities that will be required after closing the facility 
discussions with the local authorities regarding the required level of remediation are ongoing 
at january   the environmental reserve for the potenza  italy facility was million 
it is reasonably possible that there is exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued 
we cannot estimate the amount of possible liability in excess of the amount accrued due to a number of factors  including the lack of local regulations  effectiveness of existing remediation technology and the amount of time local authorities may require monitoring procedures 
we believe that additional costs related to this matter  if any  will not have a material effect on our financial condition 
we anticipate that expenditures will be made over the next seven to ten years 
in connection with the acquisition of microporous  we identified potential environmental contamination at the manufacturing site in piney flats  tennessee 
as part of the acquisition  the seller purchased an environmental insurance policy on behalf of us and also provided indemnification for a portion of the insurance policy deductible 
subsequent to the acquisition  we performed additional environmental studies and confirmed that environmental contamination was present 
at january   the environmental reserve for the piney flats  tennessee facility was million 
we recorded the estimated cost of remediation and the related receivables from the insurance company and the seller in applying purchase accounting for the acquisition 
we reached an agreement with the seller in july which  among other things  released the seller from its obligation to provide indemnification for a portion of the insurance policy deductible 
accordingly  we reduced the receivable related to this environmental matter by million at july  the receivable balance at january  was million 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at january  some of the amounts included in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  anticipated actions by third parties and other actions 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the timing and amount of payments under these obligations may vary from those reflected in this table

interest rates under the term loan facilities are variable and the table assumes that these rates are the same rates that were in effect at january  for the euro denominated debt  the table assumes that the dollar euro exchange rate is the rate at january  for all periods presented 
we lease certain equipment and facilities under operating leases 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease agreement 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options 
for euro denominated leases  the table assumes that the dollar euro exchange rate is the period average rate for for all periods presented 
includes accrued restructuring costs at january  and other restructuring costs that will be expensed and paid as incurred 
as discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have long term liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits of million as of january  our contributions for these benefit plans are not included in the table above since the timing and amount of payments are dependent upon many factors  including when an employee retires or leaves the company  certain benefit elections by employees  return on plan assets  minimum funding requirements and foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in fiscal will be million 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have environmental obligations and related indemnification receivables 
payments related to these obligations and the related amounts to be indemnified under indemnification agreements are not included in the table above since the timing of payments and indemnifications is not known

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk at january   we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the company s variable rate debt  the company may utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert all or a portion of the variable rate debt to a fixed rate obligation 
as of january   there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  holding other variables constant  would be million per year 
currency risk outside of the united states  we maintain assets and operations in europe and asia 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
as a result  exposure to foreign currency gains and losses exists 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
our subsidiaries and affiliates also purchase and sell products and services in various currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to cost increases relative to the local currencies in the markets in which we sell 
because a different percentage of our sales are in a foreign currency than our costs  a change in the relative value of the us dollar could have a disproportionate impact on our sales compared to our costs  which could impact our margins 
a portion of our assets are based in our foreign locations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
we have a euro denominated term loan and senior subordinated notes that effectively hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the translation of the euro denominated debt are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  
table of contents our consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency  primarily the euro 
the dollar euro exchange rates used in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended as set forth below were as follows period end rate period average rate our strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily on conducting our operations in a country s respective currency and may  from time to time  involve foreign currency derivatives 
as of january   we did not have any foreign currency derivatives outstanding
