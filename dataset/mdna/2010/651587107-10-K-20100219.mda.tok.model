item a 
risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
those risk factors are outlined below 
availability of raw materials and transportation systems  including sourcing from some single suppliers  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the chemical industry can experience some tightness of supply of certain materials or transportation systems 
in addition  in some cases  we choose to source from a single supplier 
any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials or transportation systems 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
our future business success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our industry is characterized by frequent changes in industry performance standards  which affect the amount and timing of our research and development costs and other technology related costs 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is often hard to predict 
further  technological changes in some or all of our customers products or processes may make our products obsolete 
our inability to maintain a highly qualified  technical workforce or their inability to anticipate  respond to  or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow in any given period 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of the products we sell are produced only in one location 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of these production facilities 
these production facilities are subject to various 
table of contents hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unscheduled downtime  and environmental hazards 
some of our products involve the manufacturing and handling of a variety of reactive  explosive  and flammable materials 
many of these hazards could cause a disruption in the production of our products 
we cannot assure you that these facilities will not experience these types of hazards and disruptions in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in any given period 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  compounds  and other technologies is important to our business 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark  and copyright law  as well as judicial enforcement  to protect such technologies 
we currently own approximately  issued and pending us and foreign patents 
some of these patents are licensed to others 
in addition  we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses or otherwise 
we have developed  and may in the future develop  technologies with universities or other academic institutions  or with the use of government funding 
in such cases  the academic institution or the government may retain certain rights to the developed intellectual property 
we also own several hundred trademark and service mark registrations throughout the world for our marks  including newmarket  afton chemical  ethyl  hitec  tecgard  greenburn biotec  and mmt  as well as pending trademark and service mark applications  including axcel 
in the event that we are unable to continue using certain of our marks  we may be forced to rebrand our products  which could result in the loss of brand recognition  and could require us to devote resources to advertise and market brands 
in particular  the loss of our hitec mark would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that the measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
the failure of our patents or other measures to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we were found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

table of contents political  economic  and regulatory factors concerning one of our products  mmt  could adversely affect our sales of mmt 
the united states epa studied mmt and determined that it does not cause or contribute to the failure of vehicle emission systems 
the canadian government has made similar findings 
the epa also required  under certain provisions of the clean air act  additional testing to fill some data gaps  including potential risks to public health 
the final report for the mmt alternative tier health testing program was accepted and requirements of the mandated program were deemed to have been met with submission of a june report to the epa 
no change in current determinations has been made 
the european union eu finalized the latest version of the eu fuel quality directive in december  rejecting a proposed ban on mmt by the european parliament s environmental committee and implementing unsubstantiated interim use limits and labeling requirements while a scientific risk assessment on metallic additives is carried out 
afton has opted to seek judicial review of the unsubstantiated interim use limits and labeling requirements pending the outcome of the scientific risk assessment 
despite these events  certain industry groups continue to urge greater regulation of all metal based gasoline additives  including mmt 
in  the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam issued a fleet test report on mmt based on tests conducted by the aam  the association of international automobile manufacturers  and the canadian vehicle manufacturers association 
the report alleges that mmt significantly raises vehicle emissions  increases fuel emissions  increases fuel consumption  and impairs the proper operation of vehicle emission control systems 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review 
to date  the government of canada has not initiated the review 
increased government regulation of mmt  if it occurs  or additional studies evaluating mmt  even if government regulation does not occur  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of that product 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production or our transportation systems and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling  and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment  and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations  and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including natural disasters and domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations  decrease demand for our products  and increase our expenses 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
federal legislation has imposed significant new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  that will require an estimated million to million in capital expenditures at our manufacturing facilities and increase our annual overhead expenses 
federal regulations have also been enacted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively 
table of contents the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in certain of the product lines and markets in which we compete 
we expect that our competitors will develop and introduce new and enhanced products  which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of certain products we manufacture 
in addition  as a result of price competition  we may be compelled to reduce the prices for some of our products  which could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers 
our inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater financial  technological  and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility than we are able to maintain 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices for raw materials  and changes in general economic conditions 
sudden or sharp raw materials price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  maleic anhydride  olefin copolymers  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused  and may continue to cause  the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest  or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products 
our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our principal customers are major multinational oil companies 
the oil industry is characterized by the concentration of a few large participants as a result of consolidation 
the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in purchases by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our customers are concentrated in the lubricant and fuel industries and  as a result  our reliance on that industry is significant 
most of our customers are primarily engaged in the fuel and lubricant industries 
this concentration of customers affects our overall risk profile  since our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic  geopolitical  and industry conditions 
many factors affect the level of our customers spending on our products  including  among others  general business conditions  changes in technology  interest rates  gasoline prices  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
a sudden or protracted downturn in these industries could adversely affect the buying power and purchases by our customers 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
in  net sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately of total net sales 
we do business in all major regions of the world  some of which do not have stable 
table of contents economies or governments 
in particular  we sell and market products in countries experiencing political and economic instability in the middle east  asia pacific  and latin america 
our international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  increases in royalties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  taxes  government royalties  inflationary economies and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies such as restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these factors may increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we conduct our business in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements  as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
our business is subject to government regulation and could be adversely affected by future governmental regulation 
we are subject to regulation by local  state  federal  and foreign governmental authorities 
in some circumstances  before we may sell certain products  these authorities must approve these products  our manufacturing processes  and facilities 
we are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products  manufacturing processes  and facilities by governmental authorities 
in order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products  we must  among other things  demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations 
the process of seeking approvals can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated and significant delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis  or at all 
any delay in obtaining  or any failure to obtain or maintain  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate net sales from those products 
new laws and regulations  including climate change regulations  may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscation  recall  or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution  and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls or seizures  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
our business and our customers are subject to significant regulations under the european commission s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulation 
reach became effective on june  it imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports  including testing data  on each chemical substance  perform chemical safety assessments  and obtain pre market authorization with respect to certain substances of particularly high concern 
the new regulation imposes significant additional burdens on chemical producers and importers  and  to a 
table of contents lesser extent  downstream users of chemical substances and preparations 
our manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs 
legal proceedings and other claims could impose substantial costs on us 
we are involved in numerous administrative and legal proceedings that result from  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
from time to time  these proceedings involve environmental  product liability  tel  premises asbestos liability  and other matters 
see item  legal proceedings 
we have insurance coverage that we believe would be available to mitigate potential damages in many of these proceedings 
however  there is no assurance that our available insurance will cover these claims  that our insurers will not challenge coverage for certain claims  or that final damage awards will not exceed our available insurance coverage 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations 
as a manufacturer and distributor of chemical products  we are generally subject to extensive local  state  federal  and foreign environmental  safety  and health laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land and water  the generation  handling  treatment  and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials  and remediation of contaminated soil  surface  and ground water 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with laws  regulations  statutes  and ordinances protecting the environment  including those related to the discharge of materials 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and the enforcement or interpretation of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
although we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements  the costs could be material 
noncompliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines  damages arising from third party lawsuits  or the suspension and potential cessation of noncompliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  and personal injury 
we cannot assure you that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  on site facilities or underground tanks for the storage of chemicals  hazardous materials  and waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or contamination of the environment 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury  product liability  property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances  such as premises asbestos  at or from our facilities 
we may also face liability for personal injury  product liability  property damage  natural resource damage  or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contaminants or hazardous substances from our facilities or for future accidents or spills 
a significant 
table of contents increase in the number or success of these claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
for further discussion of some related claims  see item  business environmental 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
a liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  whether currently or formerly owned or operated regardless of fault  knowledge  timing of the contamination  cause of the contamination  percentage of contribution to the contamination  or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including clean up costs  natural resource damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions  and third party claims  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a prp in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
we are subject to the federal  state and local environmental laws under which we may be designated as a prp 
as a prp  we may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up hazardous waste sites  such as a landfill to which we may have sent waste 
in de minimis prp matters and in some minor prp matters  we generally negotiate a consent decree to pay an apportioned settlement 
this relieves us of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
we are also a prp at sites where our liability may be in excess of the de minimis or minor prp levels 
most sites where we are a prp represent environmental issues that are quite mature 
the sites have been investigated  and in many cases  the remediation methodology  as well as the proportionate shares of each prp  has been established 
other sites are not as mature  which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of future clean up or remediation costs 
generally  environmental remediation and monitoring will go on for an extended period 
as a result  we may incur substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years 
liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at third party waste disposal sites is joint and several 
currently  we are involved in active remediation efforts at several sites where we have been named a prp 
if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to the remediation costs  we could be held responsible for some  or all  of their portion of the remediation costs  in addition to the portions for which we have already accounted 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension funds  which may be underfunded due to any underperformance of the equities markets 
our pension plan asset allocation is predominantly weighted towards equities 
cash contribution requirements to our pension plans are sensitive to changes in our plans actual return on assets 
reductions in our plans expected return on assets due to poor performance of the equities markets could cause our pension plans to be underfunded and require us to make additional cash contributions 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption  and casualty insurance  but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles 
table of contents and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
landlord and financing risks associated with foundry park i could adversely affect our financial results 
in january  foundry park i  a wholly owned subsidiary of newmarket development  entered into a deed of lease agreement with meadwestvaco under which it is leasing an office building which we have constructed on approximately three acres 
our landlord and financing activities may subject us to the following risks we may incur costs associated with our landlord activities that exceed our expectations and result in the foundry park i operations materially negatively impacting our results of operations for our real estate development segment  and we may incur losses  which could be material  under the goldman sachs interest rate swap agreement 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the interest rate swap 
we may not be able to complete future acquisitions or successfully integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in completing acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition  or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which reduces your ability to gauge our performance 
external factors beyond our control  such as customer orders  product shipment dates  and other factors can cause shifts in net sales and income from quarter to quarter 
these external factors can magnify the impact of industry cycles 
as a result  our income and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis  and your ability to gauge trends in our business may be impaired

overview we had an excellent year during  operating successfully through a challenging economic and financial environment 
the petroleum additives segment had record earnings  despite the challenges of the worldwide economic slowdown 
as we entered  demand for our products had decreased to extremely low levels 
we believe the reduction in demand was caused by the contraction of the market for our products at an unprecedented rate  rather than a loss of customers 
product demand was very low for the first quarter of the year  but demand in the second quarter improved from the first quarter  and the third quarter product demand improved from the second quarter 
we now believe product demand has returned to more normal levels that are common in our business 
throughout  we continued to execute our business plan by focusing on delivering the goods and services our customers need 
we also continued to invest in r d and initiated a program to expand our supply chain capabilities in the far east 
cash flow for the year was excellent 
we ended the year with million of cash on our balance sheet and no drawn debt on our revolving credit facility 
finally  the project to build an office building for meadwestvaco was completed on schedule and under budget 
meadwestvaco has moved into the building and rent payments have begun for the year

the decrease between the two years reflects lower total product shipments  as well as a significant unfavorable foreign currency impact of million 
product shipments were approximately lower when comparing and the decrease in shipments was primarily in the lubricant additives product lines  which was partially offset by a modest increase in fuel additives product lines shipments 
while product shipments were lower when comparing the two years  when comparing the second half of each year  shipments increased approximately in over we believe product shipments have returned to levels that were more typical before the worldwide economic slowdown began during the second half of the unfavorable impact from foreign currency reflects the strengthening of the us dollar between and versus the other currencies in which we conduct business

the results are significantly higher across all product lines 
the most significant factors when comparing operating profit and the operating profit margins between and were higher selling prices  as discussed in the net sales section above  and lower raw material costs 
while partially offset by selling price reductions made this year  the overall increase in selling prices for is the result of actions taken throughout to raise selling prices in response to the then increasing raw material costs 
the key unfavorable factor in operating profit results between and was lower product shipments  also discussed in the net sales section 
foreign currency has impacted operating profit throughout resulting in an unfavorable impact for of million 
during the second half of  we have again experienced increasing raw material costs and tightening in the availability of certain raw materials

table of contents petroleum additives operating profit in was almost unchanged from  reflecting a small increase of less than 
despite the small change in operating profit between the two years  there were a number of factors which impacted the results 
comparing the operating profit margin for the two years reflects a margin of for and for the significant reduction in operating margins includes several key components 
costs of raw materials  as well as energy and other manufacturing costs  increased significantly during the cost of crude oil reached record high levels during the year  reflecting an increase in base oil costs  one of our primary raw materials 
we successfully increased selling prices during to begin recovering these cost increases  but margins remained compressed as we recovered some of the cost increases 
the favorable impact from increased selling prices  as well as a favorable impact from higher product shipments during  is discussed in the net sales section above 
despite the increase in product shipments over the course of  in the fourth quarter of the year  we experienced a reduction in demand for our products of approximately from the average of the first nine months of due to the worldwide economic slowdown and destocking by our customers 
the results also included a favorable foreign currency impact 
when the us dollar is weak versus other currencies in which we conduct business  as it was during  our revenues and operating profit are favorably impacted 
we believe favorable foreign currency impacts contributed approximately million to operating profit results when comparing and our sg a and r d were million higher in than  and included an approximate million unfavorable foreign currency impact 
sg a of the petroleum additives segment was approximately lower when comparing and the decrease resulted primarily from favorable foreign currency  partially offset by higher personnel related costs

the following discussion references certain captions on the consolidated statements of income 
interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in interest and financing expenses between and resulted primarily from lower average debt between the two years  as we had no drawn debt on the revolving credit facility during most of the lower debt was partially offset by slightly higher interest rates and higher amortization of deferred financing costs in due to the cost related to increased commitment levels achieved on the revolving credit facility

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on income taxes 
the increase in income before income tax expense between and resulted in an increase in tax expense of million 
the remaining change in income tax expense resulted from the higher effective tax rate  which primarily reflects the higher proportion of domestic earnings in  which are subject to both us federal and state income taxes 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the special item tax benefit of million in discussed below 
the remaining increase of approximately million between the two years resulted from increased income from continuing operations before income taxes 
income taxes for benefited from the following special items totaling million 
during fourth quarter  we concluded certain of our foreign subsidiaries would not be able to distribute dividends back to the us parent for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we designated the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as indefinitely reinvested 
the deferred income tax liability of million previously provided on these earnings was reversed and reduced deferred income tax expense by the same amount 
during our detailed review  we determined our deferred tax liability accounts provided for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were overstated by million at year end we recorded an additional deferred income tax benefit of million during the fourth quarter for this overprovision 
an overprovision of million had also occurred during the first three quarters of which was reversed in the fourth quarter and had no impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  the impact of these adjustments did not have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for the year ended december  the remaining thousand benefit related to changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions 
our deferred taxes are in a net asset position 
based on current forecast operating plans and historical profitability  we believe that we will recover the full benefit of our deferred tax assets and have  therefore  not recorded a valuation allowance

we transfer cash on an as needed basis to fund these items as they clear the bank in subsequent periods 
debt senior notes on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due these notes were not registered under the securities act 
during the second quarter  we completed an offer to exchange up to million of senior notes due that had been registered under the securities act for a like principal amount of our then outstanding senior notes that were issued in december and that were not registered under the securities act 
all senior notes were exchanged 
the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by all of our existing and future owned by newmarket domestic restricted subsidiaries 
we incurred financing costs of approximately million related to the senior notes  which are being amortized over ten years 
the senior notes and the subsidiary guarantees rank effectively junior to all of our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness  including any borrowings under the senior credit facility described below  equal in right of payment with any of our and the guarantors existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors existing and future subordinated indebtedness

the more restrictive and significant of the covenants under the indenture include a minimum fixed charge ratio of  as well as a limitation on restricted payments  as defined in the indenture 
our fixed charge coverage ratio was at december  and at december  in addition  we would have been permitted to make additional restricted payments in the amount of approximately million at december  and million at december  we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the senior notes as of december  and december  
table of contents senior credit facility on december   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement 
this credit agreement amended and restated the credit agreement that we entered into on june  we incurred additional financing costs of approximately thousand  which resulted in the total unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately million related to the senior credit facility 
these costs are being amortized over five years 
beginning in late  we entered into several additional agreements related to the second amended and restated credit agreement 
these additional agreements were as follows on december   we entered into a supplement agreement to the second amended and restated credit agreement to increase the commitment level by million 
on january   we entered into another supplement agreement to increase the commitment level by an additional million 
on march   we entered into a second amendment to the second amended and restated revolving credit agreement second amendment 
the second amendment increased the commitment level by an additional million  increased the letter of credit commitment level from million to million  increased the interest rate paid for borrowings  and amended certain defined terms and covenant calculations

on april   we entered into an agreement to add an additional lender under the revolving credit facility and increase the commitment level by million 
subsequently  on june   that lender increased its commitment level by another million 
on december   we entered into an agreement to add an additional lender under the revolving credit facility and increase the commitment level by million 
on december   we entered into a third amendment to the second amended and restated revolving credit agreement third amendment 
the third amendment amends the definition of subsidiary  allows liens on cash in an amount not to exceed million specifically related to the foundry park rate lock transactions  allows investments in real estate subsidiaries as defined in the second amended and restated credit agreement not to exceed million  and provides that transactions with the charitable foundation as defined in the third amendment will not be considered transactions with an affiliate as defined in the second amended and restated credit agreement 
we paid financing costs in and late of approximately thousand related to these agreements  and we are amortizing these deferred financing costs over the remaining term of the credit agreement 
at december   the credit agreement includes a million revolving senior credit facility for working capital and other general corporate purposes for newmarket and our subsidiaries  inclusive of a million sub facility for letters of credit 
borrowings bear interest  at our election  at either a base rate plus a margin basis points as of december  or libor plus a margin basis points as of december  
the revolving credit facility matures on december  our average interest rate under the revolving credit facility was during and during there were no borrowings outstanding at december  under the senior credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  resulting in the unused portion of the senior credit facility amounting to million 
for further information on the outstanding letters of credit  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the senior credit facility is secured by liens on a significant portion of our us assets 
in addition  the senior credit facility is guaranteed by our us subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains covenants  representations  and events of default that management considers typical of a credit agreement of this nature 
the more restrictive and significant financial covenants include minimum consolidated net worth as defined in section of the second amended and restated credit agreement  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  and a maximum leverage ratio of

we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility at december  and december  construction loan agreement foundry park i and newmarket corporation entered into a construction loan agreement with a group of banks on august  to borrow up to million to fund the development and construction of an office building 
the construction loan bore interest at libor plus a margin of basis points 
the term of the loan was for a period of months and was unconditionally guaranteed by newmarket corporation 
no principal reduction payment became due during the construction period 
as a condition of the construction loan and concurrently with the closing of the loan  foundry park i also obtained interest rate risk protection in the form of an interest rate swap 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   we paid off the outstanding balance at december  of million of the construction loan with proceeds from the mortgage loan agreement discussed below and cash on hand 
mortgage loan agreement on january   foundry park i entered into a mortgage loan agreement in the amount of million 
the loan  which is collateralized by the foundry park i office building  is for a period of five years  with two thirteen month extension options 
newmarket corporation is fully guaranteeing the loan 
the mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus a margin of basis points  with a minimum libor of basis points 
concurrently with the closing of the mortgage loan  foundry park i obtained an interest rate swap to effectively convert the variable interest rate in the loan to a fixed interest rate by setting libor at for five years 
principal payments will be made monthly based on a year amortization schedule  with all remaining amounts fully due in five years 
we had combined current and noncurrent long term debt of million at december  and million at december  the increase in debt results from draws of million on the construction loan  partially offset by payments of million on the revolving credit facility 
in addition  during  we also paid thousand on our capital lease obligations 
as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and shareholders equity  our total debt decreased from at the end of to at the end of the change in the percentage was primarily the result of the increase in shareholders equity  which was partially offset by the increase in debt 
the increase in shareholders equity reflects our earnings  partially offset by the impact of dividend payments  and a significant foreign currency impact on our balance sheet translations due to rate fluctuations between december  and december  normally  we repay long term debt with cash from operations or refinancing activities 

table of contents interest rate lock agreement we financed the construction loan for the foundry park i project to construct an office building for meadwestvaco through a group of banks 
prior to commencing construction  we took actions to identify the possible permanent lending source after construction 
to that end  foundry park i entered into an application with principal commercial funding ii  llc principal dated february   which outlined the terms and conditions under which principal would provide permanent  fixed rate financing in the maximum amount of  amortized over years with all amounts due years after the date of the loan 
the application was not a loan commitment due to the lengthy time period of thirty four months until the completion of the building 
in order to obtain a fixed rate loan  we entered into a rate lock agreement with principal dated february  principal simultaneously entered into a hedge with a third party based mainly on the forward rates of ten year treasuries 
we were not a party to that hedging agreement 
under the rate lock agreement  we agreed to post a deposit with principal and to increase the amount of that deposit if the exposure to principal on their hedge increased 
in june  principal and foundry park i determined that the loan terms set forth in the application could not be syndicated based on then current market conditions 
as a result  principal and foundry park i terminated the loan application and related rate lock agreement and mutually released each other from their respective rights and obligations under those arrangements 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the termination of the rate lock agreement and subsequent entry into an interest rate swap with goldman sachs related to the foundry park i project 
all amounts which we had deposited with principal under the rate lock agreement have effectively been returned to us at the termination of the rate lock agreement as principal transferred the deposited funds to goldman sachs as collateral for the interest rate swap related to the foundry park i project 
working capital at december   we had working capital of million  resulting in a current ratio of to our working capital at year end was million resulting in a current ratio of to the change in the working capital ratio primarily reflects significantly higher cash levels  as well as increased accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the higher sales levels for fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter the higher prepaid expenses reflect a significant increase in prepaid taxes on intercompany profit between the two years 
these favorable factors were offset by lower inventories  as well as higher accounts payable and current portion of long term debt 
the lower inventories reflect the results of our efforts to reduce inventory levels  while the higher accounts payable reflects a normal increase from an unusually low level of accounts payable at december  the increase in the current portion of long term debt results from that portion of the construction and mortgage loans which are payable within one year 
the changes in the working capital components include a foreign currency impact 
capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in we expect to continue to finance this capital spending through cash provided from operations  together with borrowing available under our senior credit facility 
environmental expenses we spent approximately million in both and  and million in for ongoing environmental operating and clean up costs  excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures 
these environmental operating and clean up expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
further  we expect to continue to fund these costs through cash provided by operations

pension and postretirement benefit plans our us and foreign benefit plans are discussed separately below 
our us pension and postretirement plans are similar and therefore  the information discussed below applies to all of our us benefit plans 
our foreign plans are quite diverse  and the actual assumptions used by the various foreign plans are based upon the circumstances of each particular country and retirement plan 
the discussion below surrounding our foreign retirement benefits focuses only on our pension plan in the united kingdom uk which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from foreign pension plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine our pension and postretirement expenses and related financial disclosure information 
additional information on our pension and postretirement plans is in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents us pension and postretirement benefit plans the following information applies to our us pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the average remaining service period of participants for our us plans is years  while the average remaining life expectancy of participants is years 
we utilize the optional combined mortality tables for males and females based on the rp mortality tables projected with scale aa as published by the irs on february  in determining the impact of the us benefit plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions under asc accounting standards codification and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on pension plan assets 
as part of the review and to develop expected rates of return  we considered a stochastic analysis of expected returns based on the us plans asset allocation as of both january  and january  this forecast reflects our expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
as of january   the expected rates were for us large cap stocks  for us long term corporate bonds  and for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
our asset allocation is predominantly weighted toward equities 
through our ongoing monitoring of our investments  we have determined that we should maintain the expected long term rate of return for our us plans at at december  an actuarial gain  where the actual return was higher than the expected return  occurred during resulting in the actual investment return being approximately million higher than the expected return for all of our us plans 
an actuarial loss  where the actual return was lower than the expected return  occurred during resulting in the actual investment return being approximately million lower than the expected return for all of our us pension plans 
this is consistent with the steep decline in the global stock markets during a small actuarial loss also occurred during resulting in the one year investment return being thousand lower in than the expected return for all of our us pension plans 
investment gains and losses enter earnings on an amortized basis over a period of years so that the recent years results caused an increase in expense of approximately thousand in  as well as an expected million increase in expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential long term benefits justify the risk premium for equity investments 
pension expense and the retiree medical portion of postretirement expense are sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to for pension assets and for postretirement benefit assets while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension and postretirement plans by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to for pension assets and for postretirement benefit assets while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension and postretirement expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption under asc we utilize the citigroup pension discount curve discount curve and liability index and other bond market indicators in developing the discount rate assumption 
we initially develop an estimated discount rate using the discount curve by applying the expected cash flows for each specific defined benefit retirement plan to the interest rates provided in the discount curve 
we then weigh the cash flows of each plan and consider other relevant market information 
our discount rate is developed based on the discount curve on the last date of december 
the discount rate at december  was for all plans 
pension and postretirement benefit expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension and postretirement benefit plans by approximately 
table of contents thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have increased our rate of projected compensation increase at december  from to 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates and investment gains or losses in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate cash contributions  before income taxes  to the us pension plans will be in the range of million to million in we expect our contributions to the postretirement benefit plans will be approximately million 
other assumptions under asc during  we reviewed our assumption for the health care cost trend rate 
based on actual cost experience  we restarted our overall assumption for health care cost increases at  scaling down to by we maintained this health care cost trend assumption for resulting in an assumed rate of for and for the assumption includes temporarily higher cost increases for our retiree prescription drug coverage 
at december   our expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans was 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
foreign pension benefit plans as discussed above  our foreign pension plans are quite diverse 
the following information applies only to our uk pension plan  which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from our foreign pension plans 
the average remaining service period for our uk plan is years  while the average remaining life expectancy is years 
we utilize pa mortality tables which allow for future medium cohort projected improvements in life expectancy with a minimum per year improvement and a year age rating based on the membership of the plan  in determining the impact of the uk pension plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions under asc and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on the uk pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return is based on both the asset allocation  as well as yields available in the uk markets 
the target asset allocation in the uk is to be invested in equities and in a mixture of government and corporate bonds  although the actual allocation at the end of was in equities and in government and corporate bonds 
based on the actual asset allocation and the expected yields available in the uk markets  the expected long term rate of return for the uk pension plan was at december  an actuarial gain occurred during as the actual investment return exceeded the expected investment return in by approximately million for our uk pension plan 
this compares to an actuarial loss of million in and an actuarial loss of thousand in investment gains and losses enter earnings on an amortized basis resulting in increased expense of approximately million in  as well as an expected million increased expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for the target asset allocation 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plan by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 

table of contents discount rate assumption under asc we utilize a yield curve based on aa rated corporate bond yields provided by barclays in developing a discount rate assumption extrapolated at terms above years based on government bond yields and the spread between these and corporate bond yields 
the yield appropriate to the duration of the uk plan liabilities is then used 
the discount rate at december  was pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have maintained our rate of projected compensation increase at december  at 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the uk pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate uk cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in outlook we begin cautiously optimistic that our business has returned to more historical levels of demand 
we are well positioned to manage the challenges associated with competing in our marketplace and have every expectation that we will continue to deliver the products our customers need for them to succeed in their marketplace 
we expect to begin manufacturing and blending in our singapore facility later this year  which will significantly improve our service levels in that key region of the world 
our plants are running at high capacities  we continue significant spending in r d and expect another successful year for our petroleum additives business 
we have a solid business base  a good technical product offering  and an excellent team which is dedicated to our customers and our business 
during  we completed the project to develop some of the downtown richmond property that we own by constructing a multi story office building for meadwestvaco 
the project finished on schedule and below budget 
during  as we have concluded our role in the construction phase of this project  we move to managing our landlord responsibilities 
in early  we secured a five year loan on the property 
we used the proceeds from this loan together with cash on hand to repay the construction loan 
the foundry park i business activities are being reported as the real estate development segment in our financial statements going forward 
our business generates significant amounts of cash 
we believe we have many internal opportunities to use some of that cash for growth in the near term  from both geographical and product line extensions 
further  it is our intention to leverage our financial strength to increase shareholder value by growing the business  with acquisitions being an area of primary interest 
our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry 
it is our view that this industry will provide the greatest opportunity for a good return on our investment while minimizing risk 
we remain focused on this strategy and will evaluate any future opportunities 
nonetheless  we are patient in this pursuit and intend to make the right acquisition when the opportunity arises 
until an acquisition materializes  we will build cash on our balance sheet and will continue to evaluate all alternative uses for that cash to enhance shareholder value  including stock repurchases and dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows  as well as our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the sec  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 

table of contents our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in reported financial results 
intangibles  net of amortization and goodwill we have certain identifiable intangibles  as well as goodwill  amounting to million at year end that are discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and  except for the goodwill  are being amortized over periods with up to approximately nineteen years of remaining life 
we continue to assess the market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the values and amortization periods are appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when significant events or circumstances occur that might impair the value of these assets 
these evaluations continue to support the value at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in this market  it could possibly cause a reduction in the periods of this amortization charge or result in a noncash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no effect on cash flows 
we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions 
environmental and legal proceedings we have made disclosure of our environmental matters in item of this annual report on form k  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k  while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  it is our opinion  based on our current knowledge  that we will not experience any material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we use assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could result in different results for the plans 
we develop these assumptions after considering available information that we deem relevant 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item income taxes we file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns  as well as individual foreign income tax returns  under which assumptions may be made to determine the deductibility of certain costs 
we make estimates related to the impact of tax positions taken on our financial statements when we believe the tax position is likely to be upheld on audit 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in the determination of the estimated future recovery of deferred tax assets 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards for a full discussion of the more significant pronouncements which may impact our financial statements  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials and marketable security prices 
these risk factors may affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives and record them in accordance with accounting standards 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at year end we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million 
of the total debt  million is at fixed rates 
there was no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the fixed rate debt 
at year end  we had no outstanding variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility 
accordingly  there is no interest rate risk associated with this debt at the end of the year 
the remaining amount of debt represents the outstanding balance of the construction loan 
during  foundry park i entered into the construction loan to borrow up to million 
the loan bore interest at libor plus basis points 
if interest rates had increased  we could have incurred additional interest costs until the loan was paid off in january as this loan was related to a capital project  all interest costs have been capitalized and will not have an impact on earnings until capitalized interest is amortized into earnings 
concurrently with entering into the construction loan  foundry park i entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of of the projected draws on the construction loan 
the fixed rate on the interest rate swap was  while the variable rate was based on libor 
as libor fluctuated and the notional amount of the interest rate swap increased  the settlement amount  or the difference between the fixed rate and libor  also fluctuated 
the settlement amount is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as the building is now completed and the interest rate swap has matured in january  the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into earnings over the depreciable life of the building 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the interest rate swap and its effect on earnings 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap with goldman sachs 
we recorded the derivative at fair value  which amounted to a liability of million at december  any change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings 
with other variables held constant  a hypothetical basis point adverse parallel shift in the libor yield curve would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the fair value of the interest rate swap with goldman sachs 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value of our debt at year end foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts 
raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  olefin copolymers  maleic anhydride  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand  or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit
