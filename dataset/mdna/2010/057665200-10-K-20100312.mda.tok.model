item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fasb codification we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb sets us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
over the years  the fasb and other designated gaap setting bodies  have issued standards in the form of fasb statements  interpretations  fasb staff positions  eitf consensuses  aicpa statements of position  etc 
the fasb recognized the complexity of its standard setting process and embarked on a revised process in that culminated in the release on july   of the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  the company refers to topics in the asc rather than statements  etc 
the above change was made effective by the fasb for periods ending on or after september  we have updated references to gaap in this annual report on form k to reflect the guidance in the codification 
overview we develop  manufacture  distribute and market specialty performance ingredients and products for the food  nutritional  pharmaceutical  animal health and medical device sterilization industries 
our reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer products and services to different markets 
we presently have three reportable segments specialty products  food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
specialty products our specialty products segment operates in industry as arc specialty products 
ethylene oxide  at the level  is sold as a sterilant gas  primarily for use in the health care industry 
it is used to sterilize a wide range of medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or soft surfaces  composites  metals  tubing and different types of plastics without negatively impacting the performance of the device being sterilized 
our ethylene oxide product is distributed in uniquely designed  recyclable  double walled  stainless steel drums to assure compliance with safety  quality and environmental standards as outlined by the us environmental protection agency the epa and the us department of transportation 
our inventory of these specially built drums  along with our two filling facilities  represents a significant capital investment 
contract sterilizers  medical device manufacturers  and medical gas distributors are our principal customers for this product 
in addition  we also sell single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical device sterilization 
as a fumigant  ethylene oxide blends are highly effective in killing bacteria  fungi  and insects in spices and other seasoning materials 
we also sell propylene oxide principally to customers seeking smaller as opposed to bulk quantities and whose requirements include timely delivery and safe handling 
propylene oxide uses can include fumigation in spice treatment  various chemical synthesis applications  making paints more durable  and for manufacturing specialty starches and textile coatings 
management believes that future success in this segment is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality  safety and customer service 
food  pharma nutrition the food  pharma nutrition fp n segment provides microencapsulation  granulation and agglomeration solutions to a variety of applications in food  pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification  processing  mixing  and packaging applications and shelf life 
major product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends  confections  and nutritional supplements 
we also market human grade choline nutrient products through this segment for wellness applications 
choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants  processing dietary fat  reproductive development and neural functions  such as memory and muscle function 
the fp n portfolio also includes granulated calcium carbonate products  primarily used in  or in conjunction with  novel over the counter and prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of osteoporosis  gastric disorders and calcium deficiencies in the united states 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food and nutrition markets by the company s customers and prospects 
the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and innovative needs 
animal nutrition health our animal nutrition health an h segment provides the animal nutrition market with nutritional products derived from our encapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to basic choline chloride 
commercial sales of reashure choline  an encapsulated choline product  nitroshuretm  an encapsulated urea supplement  and niashuretm  our microencapsulated niacin product for dairy cows  boosts health and milk production in transition and lactating dairy cows  delivering nutrient supplements that survive the rumen and are biologically available  providing required nutritional levels 
we also market chelated mineral supplements for use in animal feed throughout the world  as our proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals 
in october  we introduced the first proven rumen protected lysine for use in dairy rations  aminoshuretm l  which gives nutritionists and dairy producers a precise and consistent source of rumen protected lysine 
an h also manufactures and supplies basic choline chloride  an essential nutrient for animal health  predominantly to the poultry and swine industries 
choline  which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms  plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat 
choline deficiency can result in reduced growth and perosis in poultry  fatty liver  kidney necrosis and general poor health condition in swine 
certain derivatives of choline chloride are also manufactured and sold into industrial applications 
the an h segment also includes the manufacture and sale of methylamines 
methylamines are a primary building block for the manufacture of choline products and are also used in a wide range of industrial applications 
sales of specialty products for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits of the company s products 
management believes that success in the commodity oriented basic choline chloride marketplace is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service 
in addition  the company must continue to increase production efficiencies in order to maintain its low cost position to effectively compete in a highly competitive global marketplace 
the company sells products for all three segments through its own sales force  independent distributors  and sales agents 
the following tables summarize consolidated net sales by segment and business segment earnings from operations for the three years ended december   and in thousands business segment net sales specialty products food  pharma nutrition animal nutrition health total business segment earnings from operations specialty products food  pharma nutrition animal nutrition health total fiscal year compared to fiscal year all amounts in thousands  except share and per share data net sales net sales for were  as compared with  for  a decrease of  or 
net sales for the specialty products segment were  for  as compared with  for  an increase of or 
this increase in sales was derived principally from increases in the average selling prices of certain ethylene oxide products for medical device sterilization adopted to help offset rising raw material costs during this increase was partially offset by a decline in volumes sold of propylene oxide for starch modification 
net sales for the food  pharma nutrition segment were  for  as compared with  for  a decrease of or 
this result was driven principally by aggressive inventory management by customers along with volume declines in the human grade choline and calcium products for the supplement market  which has been negatively impacted by the worldwide economic downturn 
these declines were partially offset by a favorable product mix sold in the domestic food market  including the growth of choline into new food applications as well as growth in the bakery  tortilla and preservation markets 
also offsetting the declines were increased sales of vitashure products for nutritional enhancement 
net sales of  were realized in for the animal nutrition health segment  as compared with  for  a decrease of  or 
feed and industrial grade choline product sales and derivatives decreased or  over the prior year period  principally from well publicized softness in the us poultry and swine markets 
there were also lower export sales from our north american choline plants  largely due to the stronger us dollar in versus and international political factors affecting poultry exports 
this us volume decline was partially offset by increased volumes of choline products sourced from our italian operation into the european and international poultry markets 
this geographic mix lowered consolidated feed grade prices in the period  as did lower pricing linked to the decline in raw material costs 
sales of industrial derivatives both choline and methylamines were impacted by softness in the industrial sector  principally caused by the general economic downturn 
sales of our specialty animal nutrition and health products  targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals  increased or from the prior year comparable period as some late year improvement in dairy economics created greater demand for certain products  particularly chelates and rumen protected lysine 
partially offsetting this increase were declines in certain other specialty animal nutrition and health products  targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals largely due to due to weak dairy economics in which resulted in lower demand for these products 
gross margin gross margin for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of 
gross margin percentage for was  as compared to  for  as our margin percentage was favorably affected by product mix  lower raw material and energy costs and price increases implemented in early gross margin percentage for the specialty products segment increased by primarily due to price increases implemented in early gross margin percentage in the encapsulated nutritional products segment decreased as margins were unfavorably affected by the aforementioned aggressive inventory management by customers and volume declines in the human grade choline and calcium products for the supplement market 
gross margin percentage in animal nutrition and health increased principally from reductions in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials and improved production supply chain efficiencies in both the us and europe 
operating expenses operating expenses for were  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was due primarily to increased payroll expenses  an increase to some accounts receivable reserves for international accounts and non cash stock based compensation recognition

earnings from operations for the specialty products segment were  an increase of  or  primarily due to reductions in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials and increases in average selling prices 
earnings from operations for food  pharma nutrition were  a decrease of or  due largely to the aforementioned aggressive inventory management by customers and volume declines in the human grade choline and calcium products for the supplement market 
earnings from operations for animal nutrition health increased by  to  an increase from the prior year  resulting principally from reductions in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials and improved production supply chain efficiencies in both the us and europe 
other expenses income interest income totaled in each of and interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was for compared to for this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in average current and long term debt resulting from both normal recurring principal payments as well as accelerated payments of the term loan as defined below in the financing activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
other income of for is primarily the result of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar the reporting currency and functional foreign currencies 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate in and was and  respectively 
this increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in apportionment relating to state income taxes  as well as a change in the income proportion towards jurisdictions with higher tax rates

net sales for the specialty products segment were  for  as compared with  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was due principally to greater sales volumes of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and propylene oxide for starch modification as well as a modest price increase adopted to help offset rising raw material costs during net sales for the food  pharma nutrition segment were  for  as compared with  for  an increase of  or 
this result was driven principally by increased sales of calcium and nutritional products  as well as increased product sales in both the domestic and international food markets 
net sales of  were realized in for the animal nutrition health segment  as compared with  for  an increase of  or 
this result reflects incremental sales of approximately  from the customer list acquisition of chinook group limited chinook and from the akzo nobel acquisition 
for the twelve months ending december   sales of our specialty animal nutrition and health products  targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals  increased or approximately of the overall an h growth 
gross margin gross margin for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of  due largely to the above noted increase in sales 
gross margin percentage for was  as compared to for  as our margin percentage was unfavorably affected by product mix and higher raw material and energy costs 
gross margin percentage for the specialty products segment decreased slightly primarily due to rising raw material costs 
gross margin percentage in the encapsulated nutritional products segment increased as margins were favorably affected by increased production  a result of greater sales volume as described above 
gross margin percentage in animal nutrition and health increased and was favorably affected by increased production volumes of choline chloride and specialty derivative products 
this favorable impact was partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for were  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was due primarily to of additional amortization expense  plus sales and technical personnel expense associated with the chinook and akzo nobel acquisitions  as well as higher expenses relating to accounting  tax services  and non cash stock based compensation recognition 
with these increases  operating expenses were of sales or percentage points less than the operating expenses as a percent of sales incurred in during and  the company spent  and  respectively  on research and development  substantially all of which pertained to the food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health segments 
business segment earnings from operations earnings from operations for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of  or  due largely to the above noted increase in sales 
earnings from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin for decreased to compared to for  principally a result of the previously noted acquisition related sales which carry a lower profit margin than the company s other business segments 
in addition  despite the implementation of price increases  we were not able to fully recover cost increases in certain petro chemical raw materials  which continued or trended up within the year 
we did begin to see a reduction in certain raw material costs late in the third quarter of the company is continuing to focus on implementing price increases  productivity improvements  and  most importantly  growth through new product development which should result in improved operating margins 
earnings from operations for the specialty products segment were  an increase of or  a result of increases in sales volume and modest sales price increases offset by higher raw material costs and the previously noted increased expenses relating to accounting  tax services  and non cash stock based compensation recognition 
earnings from operations for food  pharma nutrition were  an increase of  or  due largely to increased sales of calcium and nutritional products 
earnings from operations for animal nutrition health  while unfavorably impacted by the noted petro chemical raw material cost increases  improved to  an increase of  or  and were favorably affected by organic growth and the previously noted increased sales volumes derived from the acquisitions 
other expenses income interest income for totaled as compared to for interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was for compared to  for this decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates and the decrease in average current and long term debt resulting from both normal recurring principal payments as well as accelerated payments of the term loan used to fund the chinook acquisition 
other expense of for is primarily the result of unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar the reporting currency and functional foreign currencies 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate in and was and  respectively 
this decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in apportionment relating to state income taxes  as well as a change in the income proportion towards jurisdictions with lower tax rates

historical cash payments made under such plan have approximated per year 
critical accounting policies management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss  and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are principally not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
in addition  the company follows the provisions of asc topic  revenue recognition incorporating the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a product exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and or when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of its goodwill to its carrying value 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  china and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
post employment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits incorporating former sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  the company is required to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
beginning in fiscal  we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing asc incorporating former fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas statement no 

asc clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by a tax authority 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosures 
the application of asc requires judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation incorporating former statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of the options is based on the company s historical experience of employees exercise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

this asu provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments in this asu replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant  and they establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the amendments in this asu will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  and they significantly expand the required disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements
