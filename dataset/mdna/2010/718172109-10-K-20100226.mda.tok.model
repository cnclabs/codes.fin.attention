item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 
the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows european union eastern europe  middle east and africa asia latin america canada our management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income  which we define as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the annual report 

table of contents we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products  net of sales and promotion incentives 
our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors  including the volume of products we sell  the price of our products  changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell 
mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium price brands to mid price or low price brands in any given market product mix 
mix can also refer to the proportion of volume in more profitable markets versus volume in less profitable markets geographic mix 
we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments  and  in those circumstances  we include excise taxes as a component of net revenues and as part of our cost of sales 
aside from excise taxes  our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf  non tobacco raw materials  labor and manufacturing costs 
our marketing  administration and research costs include the costs of marketing our products  other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses  and costs incurred to develop new products 
the most significant components of our marketing  administration and research costs are selling and marketing expenses  which relate to the cost of our sales force as well as to the advertising and promotion of our products 
c narrative description of business our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture  market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 
our total cigarette shipments decreased in to billion units 
we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately trillion units in  a increase over we estimate that our share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the people s republic of china prc  we estimate that our share of the international cigarette market was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
shipments of our principal brand  marlboro  decreased in  and represented approximately of the international cigarette market  excluding prc  in and  and in we have a cigarette market share of at least  and  in a number of instances substantially more than  in approximately markets  including algeria  argentina  australia  austria  belgium  canada  colombia  the czech republic  finland  france  germany  greece  hungary  indonesia  italy  japan  kazakhstan  mexico  the netherlands  the philippines  poland  portugal  romania  russia  saudi arabia  serbia  singapore  spain  sweden  switzerland  turkey and ukraine

distribution and sales the distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market  including retailer needs and capabilities  the wholesale infrastructure  our competitive position  costs and the regulatory framework 
our goals are speed  efficiency and widespread availability of our products  while at the same time contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners 
the four main types of distribution that we use across the globe are direct sales and distribution dsd  where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers 
single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution within a single market 

table of contents exclusive zonified distribution ezd  where distributors have an exclusive territory within a country to enable them to obtain a suitable return on their investment 
distribution through wholesalers  where we supply either national or regional wholesalers who then service the retail trade 
in many countries we also service key accounts  including gas stations  retail chains and supermarkets  directly 
our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that in the aggregate total approximately  employees worldwide 
our sales forces are well trained  recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism  and have developed a long lasting relationship with the wholesale and retail trade  thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale  as evidenced by our leading market share position in many markets 
in addition  our consumer engagement teams work together with the sales forces to engage adult smokers in promotional activities and to support new product launches 
our products are advertised and promoted through various media and channels  including  where permitted by law  point of sale communications  brand events  access controlled web sites  print  new digital technologies and direct communication to verified adult smokers 
our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail  email and other electronic communication tools 
promotional activities include  where permitted by law  competitions  invitation to events  interactive programs  consumer incentive items and price promotions 
to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets  we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools based on the latest technologies and consumer trends 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  taste  innovation  packaging  service  marketing  advertising and price 
our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and  in some instances  government owned tobacco enterprises  principally in china  egypt  thailand  taiwan  vietnam and algeria 
industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures 
some competitors have different profit and volume objectives  and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 
we compete predominantly with american type blended cigarettes  such as marlboro  l m and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets 
we seek to compete in all profitable price segments 
procurement and raw materials we purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world  the majority through independent tobacco dealers 
we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including the united states  argentina  mexico  indonesia  ecuador  dominican republic  poland  colombia  and portugal 
our largest sources of supply are the united states for virginia flue cured and burley tobaccos  particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands 
brazil  particularly for virginia tobaccos but also for burley 
indonesia  mostly for domestic use in kretek products 
turkey and greece  mostly for oriental 
argentina and malawi  mostly for burley 

table of contents we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 
in addition to tobacco leaf  we purchase a wide variety of other non tobacco materials from a total of approximately suppliers 
our top suppliers of non tobacco materials combined represent more than of our total non tobacco material purchases 
the three most significant non tobacco materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging  acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing 
in addition  the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our indonesian business

research and development our research efforts are focused on understanding the mechanisms of tobacco related diseases  and specifically the complex role of tobacco smoke constituents in the development of tobacco related diseases 
this research serves as the cornerstone for our efforts to develop products that have the potential to reduce the risk of tobacco related diseases 
those efforts currently focus on smoke generation at lower temperatures  heat generation and mass transfer  biotechnology  material science and the removal of certain harmful compounds from the tobacco leaf using agronomic practices 
we are undertaking research to enable us to predict whether and to what extent a product has the potential to reduce the risk of a disease caused by smoking 
this will be critical for making substantiated statements about the potential risk reduction of such products when commercializing them 
we also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business 
we seek to be at the forefront of innovation 
significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products  resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of 
table of contents innovative new products 
further  with the increase in product regulations  support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex  requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
finally  we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco 
the research and development expense for the years ended december   and is set forth in note additional information to our financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference to the annual report

in the event of a dispute between us and pm usa under the intellectual property agreement  we have agreed with pm usa to submit the dispute first  to negotiation between our and pm usa s senior executives  and then  to binding arbitration 
seasonality our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality  although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism

risk factors 
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  our operating results  our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this annual report 
forward looking and cautionary statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in filings with the sec  in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts 
you can identify these forward looking statements by use of words such as strategy  expects  continues  plans  anticipates  believes  will  estimates  intends  projects  goals  targets and other words of similar meaning 
you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are identifying important factors that  individually or in the aggregate  could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by us  any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements 
we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document  particularly in the business environment section preceding our discussion of operating results of our business 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 
risks related to our business and industry cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes 
significant increases in cigarette related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions 
these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 
tax regimes  including excise taxes  sales taxes and import duties  can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products  or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors 
because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category  tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets 
as a result  our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 
increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes  due to resulting lower consumption levels  a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the mid price or low price cigarette categories  where we may be under represented  from local sales to legal cross border purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit 

table of contents the european commission is seeking to alter minimum retail selling price systems 
several eu member states have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and  in some cases  other tobacco products 
the european commission has commenced proceedings against these member states in the european court of justice  claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe eu law 
the advocate general of the court of justice issued an advisory opinion related to the proceedings against austria  france and ireland  agreeing with the position of the european commission 
if the european commission s infringement actions are successful  they could adversely impact excise tax levels and or price gaps in those markets 
our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products 
governmental actions  combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking  have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets  and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels 
significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets  driven principally by the world health organization s framework convention on tobacco control fctc 
the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco  and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation 
in addition  the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers 
regulatory initiatives that have been proposed  introduced or enacted include the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges  restrictions or bans on advertising  marketing and sponsorship  the display of larger health warnings  graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements  restrictions on packaging design  including the use of colors  and plain packaging  restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines  requirements regarding testing  disclosure and performance standards for tar  nicotine  carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents  requirements regarding testing  disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients  increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and  in some instances  in private places and outdoors  elimination of duty free allowances for travelers  and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies 
partly because of some or a combination of these measures  unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets  principally western europe and japan  have been in general decline and we expect this trend to continue 
our operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for our products  any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements and requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products 
litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ets could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 
there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions 
damages claimed in some of the tobacco related litigation are significant and  in certain cases in brazil  israel  nigeria and 
table of contents canada  range into the billions of dollars 
we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed 
the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation 
please see item legal proceedings of this form k for a discussion of tobacco related litigation 
we face intense competition  and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  taste  innovation  packaging  service  marketing  advertising and price 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions  erosion of consumer confidence  competitors introduction of low price products or innovative products  higher cigarette taxes  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories  and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products 
competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and  in some instances  government owned tobacco enterprises  principally in china  egypt  thailand  taiwan  vietnam and algeria 
industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures 
some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 
because we have operations in numerous countries  our results may be influenced by economic  regulatory and political developments in many countries 
some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes 
in others  nationalization  terrorism  conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment 
economic  political  regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities 
in addition  such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations  which could reduce our volumes  revenues and net earnings 
in certain markets  we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 
in addition  despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct  given the breadth and scope of our international operations  we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees 
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 
our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences  which may be influenced by local economic conditions 
to be successful  we must promote brand equity successfully  anticipate and respond to new consumer trends  develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios  improve productivity  and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases 

table of contents in periods of economic uncertainty  consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands  and the volume of our premium price  high price and mid price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 
we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting  contraband and cross border purchases 
large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market 
we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand  although we cannot quantify the amount of revenues we lose as a result of this activity 
in addition  our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal cross border purchases 
from time to time  we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 
investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes  allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets  allegations of underpayment of custom duties and or excise taxes  and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as lights and ultra lights 
we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced  and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results by business segment business environment governmental investigations for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 
we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases 
we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking 
our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers taste expectations 
we may not succeed in these efforts 
if we do not succeed  but one or more of our competitors do  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
further  we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers  which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 
our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates  and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 
we conduct our business primarily in local currency and  for purposes of financial reporting  the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 
during periods of local economic crises  foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar  reducing our margins 
actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 
the repatriation of our foreign earnings  changes in the earnings mix  and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate 
because we are a us holding company  our most significant source of funds will be distributions from our non us subsidiaries 
under current us tax law  in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our non us subsidiaries 
these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost 
it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions  which could result in a 
table of contents material increase in our overall effective tax rate 
additionally  the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms  such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate 
our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products  enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 
our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully  to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 
we may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 
one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 
acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration  strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings 
there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 
government mandated prices  production control programs  shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 
as with other agricultural commodities  the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand  and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns 
tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls  including government mandated prices and production control programs 
changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco 
any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices  quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 
our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 
the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance 
as a result  we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 
we could incur significant indemnity obligations if our action or failure to act causes the spin off to be taxable 
under the tax sharing agreement between altria and us  we have agreed to indemnify altria and its affiliates if we take  or fail to take  any action where such action  or failure to act  precludes the spin off from qualifying as a tax free transaction 
for a discussion of these restrictions  please see the distribution us federal income tax consequences of the distribution  which is included in our registration statement on form your percentage ownership of our common shares may be diluted by future acquisitions 
to the extent we issue new shares of common stock to fund acquisitions  your percentage ownership of our shares will be diluted 
there is no assurance that the effect of this dilution will be offset by accretive earnings from the acquisition

item legal proceedings 
legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us  and or our subsidiaries  and or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions 
our indemnitees include distributors  licensees  and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend  as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments  if any  that may be entered against them 
altria group  inc and pm usa are also indemnitees  in certain cases  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria group  inc and pmi 
various types of claims are raised in these proceedings  including  among others  product liability  consumer protection  antitrust  and tax 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
damages claimed in some of the tobacco related litigation are significant and  in certain cases in brazil  israel  nigeria and canada  range into the billions of dollars 
the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions  together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims  demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the 
table of contents ultimate outcome 
much of the litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty 
however  as discussed below  we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco related litigation 
we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
at the present time  while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur  i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco related cases  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobacco related cases  and iii accordingly  management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases  if any 
legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation 
nevertheless  although litigation is subject to uncertainty  we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe  and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us  as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts  if any 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended 
however  we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 
the table below lists the number of tobacco related cases pending against us and or our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february   december  and type of case number of cases pending as of february  number of cases pending as of december  number of cases pending as of december  individual smoking and health cases smoking and health class actions health care cost recovery actions lights class actions individual lights cases small claims court public civil actions includes two cases due to the acquisition of rothmans in canada

of these  cases   which were filed by the same plaintiffs attorney  have now been stayed pending an investigation by the public prosecutor into the conduct of that plaintiffs attorney 
in may  the case files in these cases were permanently confiscated by the court as a result of the investigation 
as a consequence of the confiscation of these case files  the small claims courts in which the cases are pending have begun dismissing the cases  and the remainder of the cases should be dismissed in the coming months 
since  when the first tobacco related litigation was filed against a pmi entity  smoking and health  lights  health care cost recovery cases and public civil actions in which we and or one of our subsidiaries and or indemnitees was a defendant have been terminated in our favor
