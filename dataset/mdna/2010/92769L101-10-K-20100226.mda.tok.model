for further discussion of our business  please refer to item of this document 
revenue our revenue by segment for the years ended december   and was as follows in millions year ended december  consumer business content 
table of contents the principal sources of revenue within each segment are consumer monthly fees and usage charges for cable and non cable telephone and internet access services and cable television services  monthly fees and usage charges for mobile services including charges for airtime  data  long distance calls and roaming  and charges for the supply of mobile handset and other equipment 
business monthly fees and usage charges for inbound and outbound voice  data and internet services and charges for transmission  fiber and voice services provided to retail and wholesale customers

disposal of business units disposal of sit up on april   we sold our sit up reporting unit  which was formerly included within our content segment 
sit up provided a variety of retail consumer products through three interactive auction based television channels price drop tv  bid tv and speed auction tv 
in accordance with the provisions of the property  plant and equipment topic of the asc  we determined that  as of march   the planned sale of the sit up business met the requirements for it to be reflected as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations in both the current and prior periods as of march  these consolidated financial statements reflect sit up as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations and we have retrospectively adjusted the balance sheet as of december  and statements of operations  cash flows and shareholders equity for the years ended december  and revenue of the sit up business  reported in discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
sit up s pre tax loss  reported within discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
revenue related to the carriage of the sit up channels recognized in our consumer segment that had previously been eliminated for consolidation purposes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
factors affecting our business a number of factors affect the performance of our business  at both a general and segment level 
general factors that affect all of the segments in which we operate are as follows general macroeconomic factors 
general macroeconomic factors in the uk have an impact on our business 
for example  during an economic slowdown  potential and existing customers may be less willing  or able to purchase our products or upgrade their services 
we may also experience increased churn and higher bad debt expense 
in addition  expenditures by advertisers are sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in recessionary periods and other periods of uncertainty 
we have experienced a decrease in advertising revenues generated through our television programming and broadband internet platforms  except to the extent offset by an increase in our share of the advertising market 
currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
we have in place hedging programs that seek to mitigate the risk from these exposures 
while the objective of these programs is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying currency exchange rates  not all of our exposures are hedged  and not all of our hedges are designated as such for accounting purposes 
additionally  we do not hedge the principal portion of our convertible senior notes 
we also purchase goods and services in us dollars  euros and 
table of contents south african rand  such as tv programming  customer premise equipment and network maintenance services and most of these exposures are not hedged 
integration and restructuring activities 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
we anticipate significant cost savings from the plan and that the annual savings from and after will exceed the annual costs incurred in connection with the plan 
these costs will include purchases of fixed assets  lease and contract exit costs  employee termination costs and other restructuring and restructuring related expenses  some of which will be classified as restructuring costs 
in total  we expect to incur operating expenditures of between million to million and capital expenditures of between million to million in connection with this plan over a three year period 
our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to implement our restructuring plan successfully and realize the anticipated benefits 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our cable network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network and in new technologies  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
consumer segment in our consumer segment  cable customers account for the majority of our revenue 
the number of customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to these customers and by the number of services that we provide to them and  with respect to our fixed and mobile telephone customers  by usage levels of our services 
for example  cable broadband internet is more profitable than our television services and  on average  our triple play customers are more profitable than double play or single play customers 
similarly  over the service term our contract mobile customers are more profitable than our prepay mobile customers  and provide a better opportunity for cross sell of our cable products 
we actively promote quad play services and our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services such as television  fixed and mobile telephone and broadband at a lower price than each stand alone product on a combined basis 
factors particularly affecting our consumer segment include average revenue per user  or arpu  churn  competition  seasonality and distribution 
cable arpu 
cable arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from our residential cable customers on our network 
we believe that our triple play cable offering of television  broadband and fixed line telephone services is attractive to our existing cable customer base and generally allows us to increase our cable arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
cable arpu excludes any revenue from our mobile and non cable customers 
mobile arpu 
mobile arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing revenue from our mobile customers 
the mix of prepay and contract customers and level of usage have a material impact on mobile arpu 
the mix of our customer base is changing as we focus on acquiring higher lifetime value contract customers  particularly through cross selling to our cable customer base  rather than lower lifetime value prepay customers 
consequently  the number of prepay customers is expected to continue to decline in  along with prepay usage 

table of contents churn 
churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing to any of our services 
an increase in our churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in order to manage our churn rates 
our ability to reduce our churn rates beyond a base level is limited by factors like competition  the economy and  in respect of our cable business  customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season 
managing our churn rates is a significant component of our business plan 
our churn rates may increase if our customer service is seen as unsatisfactory  if we are unable to deliver any of our services without interruption  if we fail to match offerings by our competitors  if we increase our prices  if there is an improvement in the uk housing market or if there is a prolonged economic downturn 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant and increasing competition in the market for our consumer services  including broadband and telephone services offered by british telecom  or bt  resellers or local loop unbundlers  such as british sky broadcasting group plc  or bskyb  and carphone warehouse talk talk  alternative internet access services like dsl  satellite television services offered by bskyb and by bbc and itv through freesat  free to air digital terrestrial television offered through freeview  internet protocol television offered by bt  and mobile telephone  television and data services offered by other mobile telephone operators including o  vodafone  orange  t mobile and  and from other mobile virtual network operators  including tesco mobile  bt mobile and carphone warehouse 
in addition  certain competitors  such as bt  bskyb and large mobile network operators are dominant in markets in which we compete and may use their dominance in those markets to offer bundled services that compete with our product offerings 
as a result of increased competition  we have had to  and may be required to continue to  adjust our pricing and offer discounts to new and existing customers in order to attract and retain customers 
seasonality 
some of our consumer revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by residential customers tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
in the fourth quarter of each year  our mobile customer acquisition and retention costs typically increase due to the christmas holiday period 
our mobile arpu generally decreases in the first quarter of each year due to the fewer number of days in february and lower usage after the christmas holiday period 
our churn rates include persons who disconnect their service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodation between academic years 
distribution 
we primarily rely upon third parties to distribute our mobile products and services 
if any of these distribution partners were to cease to act as distributors for our products and services  or the commissions or other costs charged by the third parties were to increase  our ability to gain new mobile customers or retain existing customers may be adversely affected 
we also distribute our products through our own retail outlets 
business segment factors particularly affecting our business segment include competition  pricing and operational effectiveness 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain business customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant and increasing competition in the market for our business services  including data and voice services offered by bt  cable wireless plc  virtual network operators and systems integrators 
while bt represents the main competitive threat nationally due to its network reach and product portfolio  other providers compete within product and geographic segments 
other providers  such as kingston communications hull plc and colt telecom group plc  compete with us in specific regions 

table of contents pricing 
competition in the uk business telecommunications market continues to be based on value for money  the key components of which are quality  reliability and price 
particularly  in the current challenging economic conditions  price is becoming an increasingly important factor 
certain of bt s product pricing is regulated by the uk office of communications  however  in respect of non regulated product pricing  the market is increasingly price sensitive 
operational effectiveness 
because of the extensive use of optical fiber in our access networks  we are also able to provide high speed ethernet services directly to business customers and provide nationwide area networking to these customers via our core networks 
business customers require timely installation services and our ability to meet required timescales and commence providing services may impact our revenues 
we regularly rely on third party suppliers to connect business customers and we have a variety of alternative methods to connect our national telecommunications network to the premises of business customers that are located outside of our cabled areas 
content segment factors particularly affecting our content segment include competition  the number of buyers for our television channels across limited distribution platforms  our access to content  seasonality and advertising revenue 
competition 
our television channels compete with other broadcasters for advertising revenues  subscription revenues and programming rights 
ids  our advertising sales department  competes with advertising sales operations representing other television broadcasters 
the level of this competition is increasing as the advertising sales market consolidates and is higher in a poor macroeconomic climate 
limited number of buyers and distribution platforms 
all of our channels are carried on our cable platform and on the satellite platform owned by bskyb 
a few of our channels are also carried on the free to air digital terrestrial television platform known as freeview 
therefore  the principal third party buyer of programming services from our television channels is bskyb 
other than bskyb  there are no significant buyers of our programming services 
access to content 
most of the television content on the virgin media tv channels is purchased  mainly from the us  and because there is a limited supply of content available and an increasing number of digital channels in the uk  virgin media tv has experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of its imported programming 
exchange rate movements have also resulted in increased programming costs and may continue to do so 
seasonality 
our content segment incurs increased costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to the need to provide enhanced programming over the important christmas holiday period 
advertising revenue 
the majority of revenue for virgin media tv is from advertisers 
consequently  virgin media tv s revenue is directly affected by changes in the total spend on television advertising in the uk  including changes related to a sustained economic downturn  the viewing levels for its channels and the proportion of the uk advertising market represented by ids 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies 
table of contents require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
impairment of indefinite lived assets goodwill arising from business combinations  reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives  are subject to annual review for impairment or more frequently should indications of impairment arise 
impairment of goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets is determined using a two step approach  initially based on a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  then the second step compares the asset s fair value implied fair value for goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets with its carrying value to measure the amount of the impairment 
impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
we incurred impairment charges in in respect of our former mobile and sit up reporting units  and we may incur further impairment charges if  for example  market values decline or we do not achieve expected cash flows 
as a result of the business reorganization initiated in  we have realigned our internal reporting structure and the related financial information used by management and the chief operating decision maker 
during the first quarter of  our operating structures were revised with a view to building a customer focused organization able to respond effectively to rapid changes in the market  technology and customer demands through our three new customer based segments consumer  business and content 
accordingly  we now have three reporting units consisting of consumer  business and content 
our content reporting unit is evaluated for impairment purposes as at june  while the consumer and business reporting units are evaluated as at october of each year 
while we utilize a variety of valuation techniques to determine fair value  including market multiples and comparable transactions  estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows 
the following discussion summarizes each approach used to determine fair value and how it has been utilized by us market multiple approach this method provides indications of value based upon comparisons of the reporting unit to market values and pricing evidence of public companies involved in the same or similar lines of business 
market ratios pricing multiples and performance fundamentals relating to the public companies stock prices equity or enterprise values to certain underlying fundamental data are applied to the reporting unit to determine its fair value 
we utilize publicly available information regarding comparable companies which operate in north america and europe 
comparable transaction approach this method includes an examination of recent mergers and acquisitions which involves companies in the same or similar lines of business to the reporting unit 
acquisition values and pricing evidence are used in much the same manner as the market multiple approach for the determination of the reporting unit s fair value 
discounted cash flow approach this method calculates the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit using appropriate discount rates 
the discount rates are intended to reflect all associated risks of realizing the projected future cash flows 
terminal value is computed as of the end of the last period for which cash flows are projected utilizing a terminal multiple to determine an estimate of the value of the reporting unit as of that future point in time 
the terminal multiple employed is estimated utilizing the 
table of contents information attained regarding comparable companies and transactions 
discounting the terminal value back to the present and adding the present values of the future cash flows yields indications of the reporting unit s fair value 
the discount rate employed was determined using market assumptions including uk gilt yields  equity risk premiums and comparable company betas as well as ibbotson s research including size decile betas and size risk premiums 
the determination of the discount rate also utilized information regarding the cost of debt and capital structures of comparable companies along with other general market reference materials from companies such as bloomberg  standard poors and morningstar 
all of these techniques are reliant on our long range cash flow forecasts 
in estimating cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected customer numbers  projected product sales mix and price changes  projected changes in prices we pay for purchases of fixed assets and services as well as projected labor costs 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows and those estimates include inherent uncertainties  including those relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation 
assumptions used in these cash flow projections are consistent with our internal forecasts 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in the impairment review  we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
assumptions made about levels of competition and rates of growth or decline in the economy on a longer term basis could impact the valuation to be used in future annual impairment testing 
the table below presents the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets allocated to our consumer and business reporting units  and the significant inputs utilized in developing our estimate of fair value for the annual impairment tests performed in for each of these reporting units 
consumer business goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as at december   million million market multiples inputs number of comparable companies nine six ebitda multiples of comparable companies to times to times revenue multiples of comparable companies to times to times comparable transactions inputs number of transactions twenty ten ebitda multiples of comparable transactions to times to times revenue multiples of comparable transactions to times to times discounted cash flow approach discount rate applied for our content reporting unit  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaling million were tested for impairment utilizing a discounted cash flow approach with a discount rate of in fixed assets labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are 
table of contents capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our management use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives to be held and used by an entity are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic of the fasb asc 
indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
costs associated with construction and installation activities installation revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of the entertainment cable television topic of the fasb asc  in relation to connection and activation fees for cable television  as well as fixed line telephone and broadband internet services  on the basis that we market and maintain a unified fiber network through which we provide all of these services 
installation revenues in our consumer segment are recognized at the time the installation has been completed to the extent that those fees are less than direct selling costs 
installation fees in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the customer s connection 
the nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves significant judgment 
in addition to direct external and internal labor and materials  we also capitalize other costs directly attributable to our construction and installation activities 
we continuously monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and update the policy when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances  such as the development of new products and services  and changes in the manner that installations or construction activities are performed 
restructuring costs we account for our restructuring costs in accordance with the exit or disposal cost obligations topic of the fasb asc and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  primarily relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given in subleases  amounts of lease termination costs  and discount rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance relating to the fasb accounting standards codification 
effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after september   the asc became the single official source of authoritative us gaap other than guidance issued by the sec  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force eitf  and related literature 
after september   only one level of authoritative 
table of contents us gaap exists 
all other literature will be considered non authoritative

we have adopted the disclosure requirements of this guidance 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for business combinations 
this guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to prospectively recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
further  regardless of the business combination date  any subsequent changes to acquired uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances associated with acquired deferred tax assets will no longer be applied to goodwill but will be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 
this guidance establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than ourselves sometimes called minority interests to be clearly identified  presented  and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
all changes in the parent s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value 
this guidance is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december   however  presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements 
the account balances recorded in our consolidated financial statements relating to noncontrolling interests are immaterial and therefore  the disclosure requirements have not been applied as permitted by the provisions of the guidance 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which expands the disclosure requirements related to plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
the guidance requires that employers disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required by the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the asc 
the new guidance is a response to users concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the types of assets and associated risks in an employer s defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan and events in the economy and markets that could have a significant effect on the value of plan assets

we have not yet adopted the provisions of this guidance and are evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue increased by to  million from  million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to higher revenue in our consumer segment driven by increased cable revenue partially offset by decreases in mobile and non cable revenues  and in our content segment primarily due to increased carriage revenue from bskyb  partially offset by reduced tv advertising revenue 
the increase was partially offset by lower business segment revenue 
see further discussion of our consumer  business and content segments below 
operating costs operating costs for the years ended december  and were as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease operating costs consumer cost of sales business cost of sales content cost of sales network and other operating costs total operating costs for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  decreased slightly to  million from  million during the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased business segment cost of sales partially offset by increased network and other operating costs as well as increased consumer segment and content segment cost of sales 
business segment cost of sales declined as a result of reduced business segment revenues particularly in respect of lan solutions infrastructure projects and wholesale contracts and voice customers 
network and other operating costs increased primarily as a result of increased facilities and other expenses partially offset by reduced employee and outsourcing costs 
consumer segment cost of sales increased primarily as a result of increased costs of bskyb s basic and premium tv services and the cost of wireless routers that we began selling to our residential customers during  partially offset by reduced interconnect costs as a result of lower usage of fixed line telephony services

restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   restructuring and other charges increased to million from million for the same period in restructuring and other charges in the year ended december  related primarily to involuntary employee termination costs and lease exit costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in restructuring and other charges in the year ended december  related primarily to contract and lease exit costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in the last quarter of as discussed below 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
this plan will involve the incurrence of substantial operating and capital expenditures  including certain costs which we expect to treat as restructuring costs under the exit or disposal cost obligations topic of the fasb asc

table of contents depreciation expense for the year ended december   depreciation expense increased to million from million for the same period in this increase was primarily as a result of increases in depreciation in respect of new fixed assets partially offset by assets becoming fully depreciated 
amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the cessation of amortization of certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in estimated aggregate amortization expense for succeeding fiscal years is million in  million in and nil thereafter 
goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the first quarter of  we rebranded our business reporting unit utilizing the virgin trade marks 
as a result  we recorded an impairment expense of million as at december  for the telewest trademark 
we performed our annual impairment reviews for our content reporting unit as at june  and our business and consumer reporting units as at october  as a result of these reviews we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
we performed our annual impairment review for our former mobile  virgin media tv and sit up reporting units as at june  as a result of this review we concluded that the fair values of the virgin media tv and sit up reporting units exceeded their carrying value  while the mobile reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying value 
the fair value of the mobile reporting unit as at june  was determined through the use of a combination of both market and income valuation approaches to calculate fair value 
the market approach valuations in respect of the mobile reporting unit declined from the prior year primarily as a result of declining market multiples of comparable companies 
the income approach valuations in respect of the mobile reporting unit declined as a result of a combination of an increased discount rate  a reduced terminal value multiple and reduced long term cash flow estimates 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in relation to this reporting unit in the year ended december  as at december   we performed our annual impairment review of the goodwill recognized in our former cable segment and concluded that its fair value exceeded its carrying value 
interest income and other  net for the year ended december   interest income and other decreased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of lower interest rates and lower cash balances 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to million from million for the same period in  mainly as a result of lower interest rates and lower debt balances following the prepayments made in we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash interest payments was primarily due to differences in the timing of interest payments on our senior credit facility  together with lower interest rates and debt balances as described above

as at december   we performed our annual impairment review of the goodwill recognized in our former cable segment and concluded that its fair value exceeded its carrying value 
the fair value of the mobile reporting unit was determined through the use of a combination of both market and income valuation approaches to calculate fair value 
the market approach valuations in respect of the mobile reporting unit declined from the prior year primarily as a result of declining market multiples of comparable companies 
the income approach valuations in respect of the mobile reporting unit declined as a result of a combination of an increased discount rate  a reduced terminal value multiple and reduced long term cash flow estimates

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million of debt outstanding  compared to  million as of september  and  million as of december   and million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of september  and million as of december  the decrease in debt from december  is primarily due to movements in exchange rates 
our business is capital intensive and we are highly leveraged 
we have significant cash requirements for operating costs  capital expenditures and interest expense 
the level of our capital expenditures and operating expenditures are affected by the significant amounts of capital required to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network and offer new services 
we expect that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and amounts undrawn on our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through december  however  our cash requirements after december  may exceed these sources of cash 
we have significant principal payments due in under our senior credit facility that could require a partial or comprehensive refinancing of our remaining senior credit facility  and the possible use of other debt instruments 
our ability to implement such a refinancing successfully would be significantly dependent on stable debt capital markets 
on january   we issued approximately billion equivalent aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act  and outside the united states to certain non us persons pursuant to regulation s under the securities act 
the notes were issued by our wholly owned subsidiary virgin media secured finance plc in two tranches billion of senior secured notes due and million of senior secured notes due  collectively referred to as the senior secured notes 
for more information see senior secured notes below 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes were used to repay  million of our obligations under our senior credit facility 
our long term debt was issued by virgin media inc and certain of its subsidiaries that have no independent operations or significant assets other than investments in their respective subsidiaries 
as a result  they will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from their respective subsidiaries to meet their obligations 
in addition  the terms of our existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which our subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions from them under many circumstances 
our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements
