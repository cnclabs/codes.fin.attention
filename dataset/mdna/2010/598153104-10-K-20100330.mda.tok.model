exploration projects the roberts gold is a sediment hosted gold deposit located on the battle mountain eureka gold trend 
midway developed a new target concept in using geophysics and surface exploration  concluding that volcanic rocks of the northern nevada rift may cover favorable host rocks in a gravel fill area 
the company is seeking a joint venture partner for this project 
the gold rock property is a square mile land position with known gold deposits located on the battle mountain eureka trend 
this is a sediment hosted gold system in highly prospective host rocks 
a historic database of holes containing  feet of drilling was acquired outlining continuous mineralization along  feet of length 
surface work  geophysics and historic data review have identified a number of exploration targets 
a total of  feet in rc drill holes were drilled on the anchor target during five holes found strongly anomalous gold in the pilot formation  a regionally favorable host rock 
efforts in were primarily conducted by midway staff in compiling data and generating drill targets 
the surface exploration and geophysics program on the burnt canyon project identified targets in this volcanic hosted epithermal system 
disseminated gold identified in rock chip and soil sampling at five different areas have been selected as drill targets 
the project lies between high grade veins in the seven troughs district

summary of quarterly results unaudited quarter ended in quarter ended in dec sept june march dec sept june march in thousands  except per share and total cash cost per ounce data revenue from the sale of minerals nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil net loss net loss per share  basic and diluted notes and factors affecting comparability of quarters the company is a mineral exploration company at the development stage and has no operating revenues 
stock based compensation costs are a non cash expense and represent an estimate of the fair value of stock options granted 
these expenses are often the largest item included in the statement of operations and they represent a significant source of variation in loss from quarter to quarter 
stock based compensation is allocated between salaries and benefits and mineral exploration expenditures 
costs for the june quarter tend to be higher due to printing and mailing of shareholder material for the company s annual general meeting and costs of conducting this meeting 
costs for the december quarter also tend to be higher due to accruals for the annual audit 
administratively  management tends to critically review all exploration projects in detail at this time of year and makes decisions about which projects it wishes to continue and which projects it will abandon 
financial condition and liquidity there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our auditor s report on our consolidated financial statements includes an additional explanatory paragraph that states that our recurring losses from operation raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the company began the year with cash on hand of  during the company expended  on operations  invested a total of  in mineral property and equipment net of proceeds on sale of surplus equipment  the recovery of reclamation deposits and proceeds on sale of investments and raised  from the exercise of stock options and share purchase warrants for cash and the company paid the final  owed on a promissory note to end at december  with cash on hand of  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company is a going concern  which contemplates the realization of its assets and the settlement of its liabilities in the normal course of operations 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent upon obtaining the financing necessary to meet its financial commitments and to complete the development of its properties and or realizing proceeds from the sale of one or more of the properties 
the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders  the ability of the company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations  confirmation of the company s interests in the underlying properties  and the attainment of profitable operations 
as at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  working capital of  and has accumulated losses of  since inception 
management anticipates that the minimum cash requirements to fund its proposed exploration program and continued operations will exceed the amount of cash on hand at december  accordingly  the company does not have sufficient funds to meet planned expenditures over the next twelve months  and will need to seek additional debt or equity financing to meet its planned expenditures 
the company plans to file a shelf registration in the united states and canada as soon as practicable after march  pursuant to which the company subsequently intends to conduct equity offerings in there is no assurance that the company will be able to raise sufficient cash to fund its future exploration programs and operational expenditures 
these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
recently  the poor conditions in the us housing market and the credit quality of mortgage backed securities continued and worsened in  causing a loss of confidence in the broader us and global credit and financial markets and resulting in the collapse of  and government intervention in  major banks  financial institutions and insurers and creating a climate of greater volatility  less liquidity  widening of credit spreads  a lack of price transparency  increased credit losses and tighter credit conditions 
these disruptions continued in and are likely to continue into the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
these disruptions could  among other things  make it more difficult for us to obtain  or increase our cost of obtaining  capital and financing for our operations in the future 
our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect to rely upon additional financing to fund our planned operating budget throughout the current fiscal year 
if costs increase substantially or we incur greater losses than expected  our exploration activities and other operations will be reliant upon equity financings to continue into the future 
the current market conditions could make it difficult or impossible for us to raise necessary funds to meet our capital requirements 
if we are unable to obtain financing through equity investments  we will seek multiple solutions including  but not limited to  credit facilities or debenture issuances 
in  we issued a total of  common shares pursuant to the exercise of share purchase warrants for cash proceeds of  and  common shares pursuant to the exercise of stock options for cash proceeds of  as of march   there are  stock options at prices ranging from to 
while it is probable that some of these options will be exercised  it is not possible to predict the timing or the amount of funds which might be received 
midway plans to raise capital in to fund its continued exploration and development 
contractual obligations there are no contractual obligations other than those described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as of december   we have accrued  related to reclamation and other closure requirements at our properties  compared to  from december  these liabilities are covered by a combination of surety bonds and restricted cash totaling  at december  
we have accrued as a current liability what management believes is the present value of our best estimate of the liabilities as of december   however  it is possible that our obligations may change in the near or long term depending on a number of factors 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements include our estimate of recoverable value on our property  plant and equipment  site reclamation and rehabilitation as well as the value assigned to stock based compensation expense 
these estimates involve considerable judgment and are  or could be  affected by significant factors that are out of our control 
the factors affecting stock based compensation include estimates of when stock options might be exercised and the stock price volatility 
the timing for exercise of options is out of our control and will depend  among other things  upon a variety of factors including the market value of midway shares and financial objectives of the holders of the options 
we used historical data to determine volatility in accordance with black scholes modeling  however the future volatility is inherently uncertain and the model has its limitations 
while these estimates can have a material impact on the stock based compensation expense and hence results of operations  there is no impact on our financial condition 
midway s recoverability evaluation of its mineral properties and equipment is based on market conditions for minerals  underlying mineral resources associated with the assets and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization through mining operations or by sale 
midway is in an industry that is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties  including exploration risk  development risk  commodity price risk  operating risk  ownership and political risk  funding and currency risk  as well as environmental risk 
bearing these risks in mind  midway has assumed recent world commodity prices will be achievable 
we have considered the mineral resource reports by independent engineers on the midway  spring valley  pan and golden eagle projects in considering the recoverability of the carrying costs of the mineral properties 
all of these assumptions are potentially subject to change  out of our control  however such changes are not determinable 
accordingly  there is always the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties and equipment 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as a result midway has recorded a liability for the fair value of the reclamation costs it expects to incur 
the company estimated applicable inflation and credit adjusted risk free rates as well as expected reclamation time frames 
to the extent that the estimated reclamation costs change  such changes will impact future reclamation expense recorded 
recent united states accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting standards related to its accounting standards codification of the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles

the amendments to the standard clarify that if the quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  fair value is measured using a technique that uses a the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset  or b quoted prices of similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as assets  or another technique consistent with the principles of the standard 
the amendments also provide that a restriction preventing transfer of a liability does not need to be factored into the inputs used in determining the fair value 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting standards to address the elimination of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity which also replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
additionally  this standard provides more timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement with a variable interest entity

this fsp also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this fsp emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique s used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and is applied prospectively 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements
