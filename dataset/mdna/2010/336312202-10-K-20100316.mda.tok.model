the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form k 
year ended december  the following discussion and analysis sets forth the major factors that affected first security s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for the three years ended december  as reflected in the audited financial statements 
overview cpp investment on january   as part of the capital purchase program cpp under the troubled asset relief program tarp  we agreed to issue and sell  and the treasury agreed to purchase  shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock preferred shares  series a  having a liquidation preference of  per share and a ten year warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  par value  at an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the preferred shares qualify as tier capital and pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
dividends are payable quarterly on february  may  august and november of each year 
market conditions most indicators point toward the overall u 
s economy transitioning to a gradual recovery period over the balance of some economists have indicated that the future recovery may bring with it few new jobs 
however  our market received positive news  when  on july   the volkswagen group of america  inc announced plans to build a billion automobile production facility in chattanooga  tennessee 
more recently  volkswagen officials announced a supplier park that could hold or more companies that will be built adjacent to the primary production facility 
additionally  in february  wacher chemie ag announced plans to construct a new hyperpure polycrystalline silicon facility in cleveland  tennessee 
the wacher investment is also expected to be around billion and will produce silicon that is used by the solar and semiconductor industries 
the volkswagen plant will bring about  direct jobs  including approximately white collar jobs  and up to  indirect jobs to the region 
the wacher plant is expected to add approximately new jobs 
we believe the positive economic impact on chattanooga and the surrounding region will be significant and it may stabilize and possibly increase real estate values and enhance economic activity within our market area 
while the economic recession has resulted in higher unemployment across the country  our market areas benefit from more stable rates of employment 
our major market areas of chattanooga and knoxville have a lower unemployment rate of and  respectively as of november  the most recent available data  than the national and tennessee rates of and  respectively 
the economy of the dalton  georgia msa is primarily centered on the carpet and floor covering industries 
with the decline in housing starts and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements overall economy  dalton has been the most negatively impacted region in our footprint 
the unemployment rate in the dalton msa is as of november as compared to the georgia rate of 
for the chattanooga and knoxville msas  the number of unemployed workers is decreasing and  as of november  has declined by in chattanooga and in knoxville since the peak in june we anticipate these positive employment trends to continue into our market area has also benefited from a relatively stable housing market 
according to the national association of realtors  the median sales prices of existing single family homes declined only and for the chattanooga and knoxville msas  respectively  from to compared to for the nation and for the census region identified as the south 
while real estate values may continue to decline  we are hopeful that housing prices will remain above the state and national levels due to the significant economic investments being made in our market 
financial results as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of million  total deposits of billion and stockholders equity of million 
in  our net loss available to common stockholders was million  resulting in net loss of per share basic and diluted 
during  we recognized a goodwill impairment of million  or million after tax 
excluding the goodwill impairment  our net loss available to common stockholders was million  or per share basic and diluted 
the goodwill impairment represents a one time  non cash accounting adjustment and has no impact on cash flows  liquidity  tangible capital or our ability to conduct business 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and stockholders equity of approximately million 
in  our net income was million  resulting in basic and diluted net income of per share 
net interest income for declined by million primarily as a result of the reductions to the target federal funds rate by the federal reserve board that began in september and ended in december the weighted average target fund rate for was compared to for the provision for loan and lease losses increased million as a result of declining asset quality and general economic conditions 
noninterest income decreased by million  primarily a result of lower deposit fees and lower mortgage loan and related fee income 
noninterest expense  excluding the goodwill impairment of million  marginally increased  or thousand 
full time equivalent employees were at december   compared to at december  our efficiency ratio  excluding the goodwill impairment  increased to in versus in and in the efficiency ratio for increased as a result of the combined million decline in net interest income and noninterest income and the increase in noninterest expense 
we anticipate our efficiency ratio to stabilize and begin to improve during the second half of as we focus on enhancing revenue while reducing certain overhead expenses 
however  the stabilization and possible improvement of our efficiency ratio in second half is contingent on both macro economic factors  such as changes to the federal funds target rate  and micro economic factors  such as local unemployment and real estate values 
net interest margin in was  or basis points lower  compared to the prior period of 
the net interest margin of our peer group as reported on the december  uniform bank performance report was and for and  respectively 
during and into  our margin continued to decline to a low of for the first quarter of as loan yields stabilized after the final december federal funds rate cut and deposit rates continued to reprice at lower market rates  our margin began to trend upward during the second and third quarters of the issuance of over million in brokered deposits in the fourth quarter reversed this trend as the margin in the fourth quarter of was 
we anticipate our margin to decline during the first half of before stabilizing during the second half of our expectations are dependent on our ability to raise core deposits  our loan and deposit pricing  and any possible actions by the federal reserve board to the target federal funds rate

critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding md a 
critical accounting policies include the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on our financial presentation as well as accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements that require us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time 
disclosure about critical estimates is required if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced through loan and lease charge offs  net of recoveries 
the level of the allowance is based on known and inherent risks in the portfolio  past loan loss experience  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current economic conditions and other factors as well as the level of specific impairments associated with impaired loans 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions or changes to our estimated risks could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance 
such a change could materially impact our net income as a result of the change in the provision for loan and lease losses 
refer to the provision for loan and lease losses and allowance sections within md a for a discussion of our methodology of establishing the allowance as well as note to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates of fair value fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
our available for sale securities and held for sale loans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  fair value is used to measure certain assets and liabilities on a non recurring basis 
we use fair value on a non recurring basis for other real estate owned  repossessions and collateral associated with impaired collateral dependent loans 
fair value is also used in certain impairment valuations  including assessments of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell as asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
estimating fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
accounting guidance provides three levels of fair value 
level fair value refers to observable market prices for identical assets or liabilities 
level fair value refers to similar assets or liabilities with observable market data 
level fair value refers to assets and liabilities where market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for similar assets or liabilities 
level valuations require modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability 
changes in fair value could materially impact our financial results 
refer to note  fair value measurements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our methodology of calculating fair value 
goodwill our policy is to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
as more fully described below  we recorded a full goodwill impairment during income taxes we are subject to various taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business and we estimate income tax expense based on amounts that we expect to owe to these jurisdictions 
we evaluate the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on a current estimate of annual net income  tax credits  non taxable income  non deductible expenses and the applicable statutory tax rates 
the estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the accrued tax liability or receivable represents the net estimated amount due or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities or other assets  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by tax authorities and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  if or when they occur  could impact accrued taxes and future tax expense and could materially affect our financial results 
we periodically evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of tax reserves related to each of these positions 
additionally  we evaluate our deferred tax assets for possible valuation allowances based on the amounts expected to be realized 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and deferred tax assets involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
changes in the results of these evaluations could have a material impact on our financial results

net income available to common shareholders in was significantly below the level predominately as a result of the goodwill impairment and higher provision expense

in  net interest income was million  or less than the level of million  which was less than the level of million 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits

for  average interest earning assets increased to billion 
however  the associated increase in earnings from the higher volumes was offset by the decline in the yields of earning assets and a shift in earning assets  as discussed in additional detail below 
the decrease in interest income from to was due to the impact of the reductions in yields exceeding the impact of the increases in the volume of earning assets 
average loans in were million  a decrease of million  or 
average taxable debt securities increased million  or 
other earning assets increased million to million 
the largest component of other earning assets is our interest bearing account at the federal reserve bank of atlanta that averaged million during this account yields approximately basis points 
the increase in average taxable debt securities and other earning assets was funded by the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements reductions in loans and increases in brokered deposits 
the impact on interest income from the decline in average loans fully offset the increases in the other categories of earning assets 
the total impact on interest income from changes in volume was a reduction of thousand comparing to the reduction in yield of average earnings assets reduced interest income by million  accounting for of the total decline  on a fully tax equivalent basis from to the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points in to from in  which was basis points lower than the reduction in yield on loans for was basis points  which was a result of the full impact of the cuts in the federal funds rate 
from september to december  the federal reserve board reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points to a target rate of 
throughout the last twenty four months  we had an asset sensitive balance sheet  which means that earning assets reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities and thus interest income declines faster than interest expense in a declining rate environment 
total interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in interest expense for decreased due to the reduced cost of funds as well as reduced volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense for decreased due to the reduced cost of funds despite the additional volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
average interest bearing liabilities declined by million  or  to million for compared to during  we replaced non deposit liabilities  primarily short term other borrowings  with long term brokered deposits 
average interest bearing liabilities  excluding average deposits  declined by million while average brokered deposits increased million 
in market certificates of deposits declined by million  or  while money markets increased million  or 
the total impact on the changes in volume of average interest bearing liabilities was a decline in interest expense of million 
comparing to  average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to million 
during  average brokered deposits increased by million  or  average other borrowings increased by million  or  and average federal funds purchased increased by million from million to million 
these increases in non core deposits were primarily used to fund our loan growth for the reduction of costs on interest bearing liabilities reduced interest expense by million  accounting for of the total change of million comparing to deposit pricing  especially for time deposits  typically lags changes in the target federal funds rate  and therefore we realized a consistent but gradual reduction in our costs of deposits throughout the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities for decreased by basis points from to 
beginning in the second half of and continuing into  we decided to fortify our balance sheet and improve our contingent funding plans so we significantly reduced our overnight borrowings and replaced them with brokered deposits 
during the fourth quarter of  we took advantage of historically low rates and further extended our brokered cd ladder 
we issued approximately million of brokered cds during the fourth quarter of with a weighted average maturity of months and weighted average rate of 
the bulk of these funds were placed in our interest bearing account at the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
these funds will serve as excess liquidity to fund contractual obligations or prudent investments 
comparing to  the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to from 
our rate decreases in were a reflection of the market conditions 
we expect average loans to continue to decline in while all other earnings assets increase or are comparable to the levels 
the average yield on loans in should be comparable to while the overall yield on earning assets may decline in due to the increase in interest bearing cash and the associated lower yield 
we expect average interest bearing liabilities to be comparable with a shift from average other borrowings to average brokered cds 
rates paid on deposits are expected to be consistent with rates 
net interest income net interest spread and net interest margin the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does 
table of contents 
index to financial statements not consider the impact of noninterest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing noninterest bearing deposits in earning assets 
first security s net interest rate spread on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in  while the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for was primarily due to the full year impact of the federal reserve board cuts to the target federal funds rate  partially offset by the repricing of our deposits 
the decline from was also due to the federal reserve board rate cuts 
during  approximately of our loans repriced simultaneously with changes to an associated index such as prime  which is driven by the target federal funds rate  while only approximately of our liabilities repriced simultaneously 
as such  the target rate reductions by the federal reserve board had an immediate negative impact on our net interest spread and net interest margin 
additionally  a decline in average noninterest bearing deposits for contributed an additional basis points to the reduction in net interest margin 
for  noninterest bearing deposits contributed basis points to the net interest margin  as compared to basis points during in october  we entered into cash flow swaps with a million total notional value 
the swaps exchanged a portion of our prime based variable rate payments for fixed rate payments 
the fixed rate was appropriately 
on march   we elected to terminate the interest rate swaps for million due to increasing counterparty credit risk 
by terminating the swaps  we locked in the gain  which is accreting into interest income over the remaining life of the originally hedged items 
the terminated swaps  combined with swaps we terminated in  added approximately million to interest income in for  we estimate the terminated swaps will add approximately million to interest income 
we anticipate our net interest spread and net interest margin to decline during the first half of before stabilizing or increasing in the second half of the anticipated decline is associated with the negative spread created in the fourth quarter of by issuing brokered deposits and placing the bulk of the proceeds in our interest bearing account at the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
the stabilization for the second half of depends on multiple factors  including our ability to raise core deposits  our growth or contraction in loans  our deposit and loan pricing  and any possible further action by the federal reserve board to adjust the target federal funds rate 
provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations during increased million to million compared to million in and million in net charge offs totaled million for  million for and million for net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  in and in and our bank s peer group averages as reported in the december  uniform bank performance report were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses in relative to was a result of our analysis of inherent risks in the loan portfolio in relation to the portfolio s growth  the level of impaired  past due  charged off  classified and non performing loans  as well as increased environmental risk factors due to the general economic conditions 
during  we significantly increased our allowance for loan and lease losses from of total loans as of december  to of total loans as of december  the provision expense associated with this reserve building was approximately million 
as of december   we determined our allowance of million was adequate to provide for credit losses  which we describe more fully below in the allowance for loan and lease loss section of md a 
we will continue to provide provision expense to maintain an allowance level adequate to absorb known and estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
as the determination of provision expense is a function of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we cannot reasonably estimate the provision expense for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements furthermore  the provision expense could materially increase or decrease in depending on a number of factors  including  among others  the level of net charge offs  the amount of classified loans and the value of collateral associated with impaired loans

we anticipate pos fees to continue to grow as customer trends show increased use of debit cards 
mortgage loan and related fees for were million  compared to million in and million in as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we began electing the fair value option under applicable accounting guidance to our held for sale loan originations in february this election impacted the timing and recognition of origination fees and costs  as well as the value of the servicing rights 
the recognition of the income is now concurrent with the origination of the loan 
we believe the fair value option improves financial reporting by better aligning the underlying economic changes in value of the loans and related hedges to the reported results 
additionally  the election eliminates the complexities and inherent difficulties of achieving hedge accounting 
our process to originate and sell a conforming mortgage in the secondary market typically takes to days from the date of mortgage origination to the date the mortgage is sold to an investor in the secondary market 
due to the normal processing time  we will have a certain amount of held for sale loans at any time 
we sell these loans with the right to service the loan being released to the purchaser for a fee 
mortgages originated for sale in the secondary markets totaled million for  million in and million in mortgages sold in the secondary market totaled million for  million and million in we do not originate sub prime loans

total occupancy expense for decreased by compared with  which was more than total occupancy expense in the decrease in was due to cost saving initiatives at our branch locations 
the increase in was primarily due to higher utility costs and higher property taxes 
as of december   we leased nine facilities and the land for five branches 
as a result  occupancy expense is higher than if we owned these facilities  including the real estate  but conversely  we have been able to deploy the capital into earning assets rather than capital expenditures for facilities 
furniture and equipment  communication  advertising  and printing and supplies expense decreased both in and due to cost controls implemented 
professional fees increased by thousand  or  from to  and increased by thousand  or  from to the increase in is primarily due to additional legal costs associated with the higher levels of non performing assets and the arbitration settlement  described further below  as well as a fourth quarter third party loan review  as more fully described in the asset quality and non performing assets section of md a

we anticipate professional fees to be consistent or lower for the premium paid for fdic deposit insurance increased million to million in compared to the expense in and was thousand and thousand 
for  we recorded a thousand charge for the fdic special assessment that was paid on september  the remaining increase is due to an across the board increase in the fdic s assessment calculation  which became effective in as well as our participation in the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which is funded through add on premium fees 
during the fourth quarter of  the fdic approved a rule mandating all banks prepay deposit premium insurance assessments for the three year period ending december  the total prepayment amount factored in an estimated five percent annual growth rate in the deposit base as well as a uniform three basis point increase in the assessment rate effective january  no additional cash payments or refunds are required or issued until the later of the date the prepayment is exhausted or december  the fdic indicated that it intends the prepayment option to eliminate the need for additional special assessments

our policy is to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
accounting guidance requires us to estimate the fair value in making the assessment of impairment at least annually 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in computing the fair value estimate for the goodwill as of september  the firm utilizes two separate valuation methodologies and compares the results of each methodology in order to determine the fair value of the goodwill associated with our prior acquisitions 
the impairment testing is a two step process 
step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value 
if the fair value is below the carrying value  step is performed 
step involves a process similar to business combination accounting in which fair values are assigned to all assets  liabilities and other non goodwill intangibles 
the result of step is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is below the recorded goodwill amount  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the results of the third party goodwill assessment for indicated a full impairment and therefore we recorded a million goodwill impairment as of september  the impairment was primarily a result of the continuing economic downtown and its implication on bank valuations

index to financial statements the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of the loan portfolio as of december  our loan policy does not permit automatic roll over of matured loans 
nonaccrual loans are included in the three to twelve month bucket 
less than three months over three months to twelve months one year to five years over five years total in thousands construction and land development loans commercial and industrial loans all other loans total allowance for loan and lease losses allowance overview the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects our assessment and estimate of the risks associated with extending credit and our evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
we regularly analyze our loan portfolio in an effort to establish an allowance that we believe will be adequate in light of anticipated risks and loan losses 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  we review the size  quality and risk of loans in the portfolio 
we also consider such factors as our loan loss experience  specific known risks  the status and amount of past due and non performing assets  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current and anticipated economic conditions  and other factors which we believe affect the allowance for potential credit losses 
the allowance is composed of three primary components specific impairments for substandard nonaccrual loans and leases  general allocations for classified loan pools  including special mention and substandard accrual loans  and general allocations for the remaining pools of loans 
specific impairments are commonly referred to as sfas impairments and general allocations are commonly referred to as sfas allocations 
we accumulate pools based on the underlying classification of the collateral 
each pool is assigned a loss severity rate based on historical loss experience and various qualitative and environmental factors  including  but not limited to  credit quality and economic conditions 
an analysis of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is prepared by our credit administration department and presented to our board of directors or the directors asset quality committee on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our analysis  we may determine that our future provision expense needs to increase or decrease in order for us to remain adequately reserved for probable loan losses 
as stated earlier  we make this determination after considering both quantitative and qualitative factors under appropriate regulatory and accounting guidelines 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance compared to a group of peer banks 
during their routine examinations of banks  the regulators may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  their credit evaluations and allowance methodology differ materially from the bank s methodology 
we believe our allowance methodology is in compliance with regulatory interagency guidance as well as applicable gaap guidance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements while it is our policy to charge off all or a portion of certain loans in the current period when a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses that cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because the assessment of these risks includes assumptions regarding local and national economic conditions  our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 
allowance loan pools as indicated in the allowance overview above  we analyze our allowance by segregating our portfolio into three primary groupings impaired  classified and pass risk rated loans 
impaired loans are individually evaluated  as further discussed below 
classified loans are segregated first by loan risk rating and then into homogeneous pools based on loan type  collateral or purpose of proceeds 
non classified loans are grouped into homogeneous pools based on loan type  collateral or purpose of proceeds 
we believe our loan pools conform to regulatory and accounting guidelines 
impaired loans generally include those loans with a risk rating of substandard nonaccrual or doubtful 
for these loans  we determine the impairment based upon one of the following methods discounted cash flows  observable market pricing or the fair value of the collateral 
a majority of our portfolio is secured by real estate and as such  we primarily use the fair value of the collateral to determine impairment 
the amount of the estimated loss  if any  is then specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance 
for classified loans  we first separate into the loan risk rating classifications of special mention and substandard 
these two groups are then further segregated into homogeneous pools based on loan type  collateral or purpose of proceeds 
each of these pools is evaluated individually and is assigned a loss factor based on our best estimate of the loss that potentially could be realized in that pool of loans 
the loss factor is the sum of an objectively calculated historical loss percentage and a subjectively calculated risk percentage 
the actual annual historical loss factor is typically a weighted average of each period s loss 
for the historical loss factor  we utilize a migration loss analysis 
each period may be assigned a different weight depending on certain trends and circumstances 
the subjectively calculated risk percentage is the sum of eight qualitative and environmental risk categories 
these categories are evaluated separately for each pool 
the eight risk categories are underlying collateral value  lending practices and policies  local and national economies  portfolio volume and nature  staff experience  credit quality  loan review and competition  regulatory and legal issues 
allowance loan risk ratings a consistent and appropriate loan risk rating methodology is a critical component of the allowance 
we classify loans as pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
the following describes our loan classifications and the various risk indicators associated with each risk rating 
a pass rating is assigned to those loans that are performing as contractually agreed and do not exhibit the characteristics of the criticized and classified risk ratings as defined below 
pass loan pools do not include the unfunded portions of binding commitments to lend  standby letters of credit  deposit secured loans or mortgage loans originated with commitments to sell in the secondary market 
loans secured by segregated deposits held by fsgbank are not required to have an allowance reserve  nor are originated held for sale mortgage loans pending sale in the secondary market 
a special mention loan risk rating is considered criticized but is not considered as severe as a classified loan risk rating 
special mention loans contain one or more potential weakness es  which if not corrected  could result in an unacceptable increase in credit risk at some future date 
these loans may be characterized by the following risks and or trends loans to businesses downward trend in sales  profit levels and margins impaired working capital position compared to industry 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cash flow strained in order to meet debt repayment schedule technical defaults due to noncompliance with financial covenants recurring trade payable slowness high leverage compared to industry average with shrinking equity cushion questionable abilities of management weak industry conditions inadequate or outdated financial statements loans to businesses or individuals loan delinquencies and overdrafts may occur original source of repayment questionable documentation deficiencies may not be easily correctable loan may need to be restructured collateral or guarantor offers adequate protection unsecured debt to tangible net worth is excessive a substandard loan risk rating is characterized as having specifically identified weaknesses and deficiencies typically resulting from severe adverse trends of a financial  economic  or managerial nature  and may warrant non accrual status 
substandard loans have a greater likelihood of loss and may require a protracted work out plan 
in addition to the factors listed for special mention loans  substandard loans may be characterized by the following risks and or trends loans to businesses sustained losses that have severely eroded equity and cash flows concentration in illiquid assets serious management problems or internal fraud chronic trade payable slowness  may be placed on cod or collection by trade creditor inability to access other funding sources financial statements with adverse opinion or disclaimer  may be received late insufficient documented cash flows to meet contractual debt service requirements loans to businesses or individuals chronic or severe delinquency or has met the retail classification standards which is generally past dues greater than days frequent overdrafts likelihood of bankruptcy exists serious documentation deficiencies reliance on secondary sources of repayment which are presently considered adequate demand letter sent litigation may have been filed against the borrower 
table of contents 
index to financial statements loans with a risk rating of doubtful are individually analyzed to determine our best estimate of the loss based on the most recent assessment of all available sources of repayment 
doubtful loans are considered impaired and placed on nonaccrual 
for doubtful loans  the collection or liquidation in full of principal and or interest is highly questionable or improbable 
we estimate the specific potential loss based upon an individual analysis of the relationship risks  the borrower s cash flow  the borrower s management and any underlying secondary sources of repayment 
the amount of the estimated loss  if any  is then either specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance or charged off 
in addition to the characteristics listed for substandard loans  the following characteristics apply to doubtful loans loans to businesses normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased seriously impaired cash flow numerous exceptions to loan agreement outside accountant questions entity s survivability as a going concern financial statements may be received late  if at all material legal judgments filed collection of principal and interest is impaired collateral guarantor may offer inadequate protection loans to businesses or individuals original repayment terms materially altered secondary source of repayment is inadequate asset liquidation may be in process with all efforts directed at debt retirement documentation deficiencies not correctable the consistent application of the above loan risk rating methodology ensures we have the ability to track historical losses and appropriately estimate potential future losses in our allowance 
additionally  appropriate loan risk ratings assist us in allocating credit and special assets in the most effective manner 
significant changes in loan risk ratings can have a material impact on the allowance and thus a material impact on our financial results by requiring significant increases or decreases in provision expense 
allowance analysis and discussion the following table presents an analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
the provision for loan and lease losses in the table below does not include our provision accrual for unfunded commitments of thousand  thousand  thousand  thousand and for    and  respectively

the comprehensive allowance analysis developed by our credit administration group enables us to allocate the allowance based on risk elements within the portfolio 
the unallocated reserve is available as a general reserve against the entire loan portfolio and is related to factors such as current economic conditions which are not directly associated with a specific loan category

over the last twelve to eighteen months  the allowance significantly increased largely because of the economic downturn and the associated decline in real estate values 
these two factors have contributed to a significant increase in classified loans 
as of december   the allowance increased million  or  compared to december  of the million increase  approximately million is associated with increases in specific impairments  while the remaining million increase relates to higher levels of risk rated loans as well as increases in the associated loss factors 
as of december   the largest components of the allowance were associated with commercial loans and real estate secured loans 
the allowance associated with commercial loans as of december   has increased million compared to december  approximately million of the increase relates to specific impairments 
the remainder of the increase is a result of higher levels of classified commercial loans 
reduced earnings and cash flow of the associated borrowers due to the economic recession is the primary factor in the increase of classified commercial loans 
the allowance associated with real estate construction loans totaled million as of december  the decline in real estate values combined with the slowdown in new home sales has increased our classified loans in this category 
we consider a number of factors should we decide to downgrade a real estate construction loan  including  but not limited to  the decline in the associated collateral value  the length of time the finished home has been on the market  and the borrower s ability to begin amortizing the loan 
in many cases  a downgraded loan may not be past due or involve a borrower missing scheduled payments  a downgraded loan instead indicates a risk of future non performance  rather than a measure of actual non performing loans 
as of december   approximately of our nonaccrual loans were current on all contractual interest and principal payments 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on our assessment of the information available  including the results of extensive internal and independent reviews of our loan portfolio  as discussed in the asset quality and non performing asset section below 
our assessment involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their reviews warrant 
asset quality and non performing assets asset quality strategic initiatives for we consider our asset quality to be of primary importance 
at december   our loan portfolio was of total assets 
during  as the economy continued to deteriorate  we implemented several significant strategies to further address our asset quality  including created a board level asset quality committee established a dedicated oreo sales team restructured our credit department developed centralized underwriting and collections processes conducted a third party loan review  and expanded our loan review department the board level asset quality committee was created during the first quarter of the committee meets monthly and is charged with providing oversight for action plans associated with significant classified loans and leases  sales plans for oreo and repossessions  reviewing the allowance for loan and lease losses and related impairment recommendations and monitoring asset quality reports  ratios and trends 
the committee has assisted management in reviewing significant credit relationships and developing appropriate work out plans 
during  we moved primary responsibility for the oreo sales process from the special assets department to a dedicated sales team 
this enabled our special assets department to focus all of its energy on loan work outs while centralizing and streamlining the oreo sales process 
our oreo sales team is focused on achieving the proper balance between maximizing the realized value upon sale and minimizing the holding period and carrying costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we began the process of restructuring our credit administration department to add additional depth and expertise 
specifically  the credit department is now aligned by line of business for commercial and retail credit with dedicated credit officers and staff supporting each of these portfolios 
the chief credit officer will serve to support both senior credit officers 
in all  eight new credit positions were created and six were filled with internal and or external resources 
we are actively seeking to fill the remaining positions  and in all cases  working to reassign qualified internal personnel 
as part of the credit restructuring  we implemented a new loan approval process that included the creation of a centralized management loan committee and eliminated the decentralized structure of our regional committees 
the centralized loan committee structure will ensure consistency regarding underwriting  loan structure  loan funding and controls  and policy compliance 
during the fourth quarter of  we engaged an independent consulting firm to conduct an extensive loan review 
the primary purpose of the loan review was to evaluate individual credits for compliance with credit and underwriting standards  and to assess the potential impairment of certain credits in which we might experience additional risks of loss 
the consultants reviewed over of our entire portfolio 
combining this review with 
table of contents 
index to financial statements existing loan review processes  approximately of the entire portfolio was reviewed 
the efforts of these combined loan reviews included approximately of commercial real estate loans and of construction and land development loans 
the results of this review were incorporated in our year end financial statements 
our internal loan review department performs risk based reviews and historically targets to of our portfolio over an month cycle 
the addition of two experienced loan review employees will enable the department to further enhance its risk based approach and increasing the penetration of our portfolio 
we believe the above initiatives will assist us during the current economic environment as well as position us for growth once economic conditions improve

additionally  there are no significant loans that were recommended for downgrade to nonaccrual by our regulators or the external loan review firm that have not been reflected in the december  nonaccrual loan amount 
as previously described  we have individually reviewed each nonaccrual loan for possible impairment 
we measure impairment by adjusting the loans to either the present value of expected cash flows  the fair value of the collateral or observable market prices 
from year end to year end  nonaccrual loans increased by million  or 
as shown above  commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans increased by million to million comparing year end to year end this increase is primarily attributable to one relationship totaling million at year end this relationship has performed according to the contractual terms 
construction and land development nonaccrual loans increased by million and commercial real estate nonaccrual loans increased million 
these increases primarily relate to the current economic conditions and its impact on our borrowers 
other real estate owned increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the million increase from year end to year end in commercial real estate is primarily related to the addition of two commercial real estate buildings totaling million and one commercial property totaling thousand 
the million increase in construction development loans is primarily driven by increases in volume  as the average value per property is approximately thousand 
the increase in residential real estate includes two additions in excess of thousand each totaling million with the remaining increase associated with volume increases 
our oreo sales team sold properties during for gross proceeds of million resulting in a realization rate of approximately based on the book value at the sales date and approximately realization rate on the originally transferred loan amounts prior to any charge offs or other adjustments

we believe the positive economic growth within our market area  as discussed in the overview section  may stabilize and possibly increase real estate values  as well as provide increased overall economic activity in our largest region 
additionally  we believe the strategic initiatives that we are executing within our credit and underwriting functions will also positively impact our ability to reduce our current and future nonperforming assets and improve the related asset quality ratios 
investment securities and other earning assets the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of our consolidated balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
currently  all of our investments are classified as available for sale

as of december   we performed an impairment assessment of the securities in our portfolio that had an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their cost was other than temporary 
under authoritative accounting guidance  impairment is considered other than temporary if any of the following conditions exists we intend to sell the security  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis or we do not expect to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis  even if we do not intend to sell 
additionally  accounting guidance requires that for impaired securities that we do not intend to sell and or that it is not more likely than not that we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements will have to sell prior to recovery but for which credit losses exist  the other than temporary impairment should be separated between the total impairment related to credit losses  which should be recognized in current earnings  and the amount of impairment related to all other factors  which should be recognized in other comprehensive income 
if a decline is determined to be other than temporary due to credit losses  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
the new cost basis would not be adjusted in future periods for subsequent recoveries in fair value  if any 
in evaluating the recovery of the entire amortized cost basis  we consider factors such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including events specific to the issuer or industry  defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest  principal or dividend payments and external credit ratings and recent downgrades

the company holds a super senior tranche bond 
the results of the analysis currently support full recovery of the investment s cost 
the unrealized losses in other securities are two trust preferred securities 
the unrealized losses are primarily due to widening credit spreads subsequent to purchase and a lack of demand for trust preferred securities 
the unrealized losses in the municipal and federal agencies are primarily due to widening credit spreads subsequent to purchase

we also had a structured repurchase agreement with another financial institution of million at december  and december  this agreement has a five year term with a variable rate of three month libor minus basis points for the first year and a fixed rate of for the remaining term 
the agreement was callable on november   the first anniversary  and quarterly thereafter 
the stated maturity is november as a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb  we have the ability to acquire short and long term advances through a blanket agreement secured by our unencumbered qualifying family first mortgage loans equal to at least of outstanding advances 
we also use fsgbank s borrowing capacity at the fhlb to purchase a letter of credit that we pledged to the state of tennessee collateral pool 
the million letter of credit allows us to release investment securities from the collateral pool and thus improve our liquidity ratio 
the terms of the fhlb advances and other borrowing as of december  are as follows maturity year origination date type principal original term rate maturity in thousands fhlb fixed rate advance months fhlb fixed rate advance months fhlb fixed rate advance months fixed rate mortgage months assumed as part of the acquisition of jackson bank interest rate sensitivity financial institutions are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that their interest bearing liabilities consisting principally of customer deposits mature or reprice more or less frequently  or on a different basis  than their interest earning assets generally consisting of intermediate or long term loans  investment securities and federal funds sold 
the match between the scheduled repricing and maturities of our earning assets and liabilities within defined time periods is referred to as gap analysis 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a positive or asset sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a negative or liability sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we issued million in brokered certificates of deposits with an average maturity of approximately years at a weighted average all in cost of 
at december   we held million in interest bearing cash  which was primarily funded through the increased brokered deposits 
the issuance combined with the retention of the cash positions us to be asset sensitive in preparation for future increases in interest rates 
we anticipate rates to begin to increase in late or early  depending on economic conditions 
the following gap analysis provides information based the next repricing date or the maturity date 
the interest rate risk income sensitivity summary table  located in item a incorporates additional assumptions  including prepayments on loans and securities and reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments  and deposits 
we believe the income sensitivity summary table located in item a provides a more accurate analysis related to interest rate risk 
the following table reflects our rate sensitive assets and liabilities by maturity or the next repricing date as of december  variable rate loans are shown in the category of due one to three months because they reprice with changes in the prime lending rate 
fixed rate loans are presented assuming all payments are made according to the loan s contractual terms

we rely primarily on management service fees and dividends from fsgbank to fund the liquidity needs of our daily operations 
our cash balance on deposit with fsgbank  which totaled approximately million as of december   is available for funding activities for which fsgbank would not receive direct benefit  such as acquisition due diligence  shareholder relations  including dividends  and holding company reporting and operations 
additionally  first security had million outstanding on a subordinated demand note receivable from fsgbank 
the note is payable on demand at the option of first security 
these funds should adequately meet our cash flow needs 
if we determine that our cash flow needs will be satisfactorily met  we may deploy a portion of the funds into fsgbank or use them in an acquisition in order to support continued growth 
on january   to further preserve our capital resources  our board of directors elected to suspend the dividend on our common stock and elected to defer the dividend payment on our series a preferred stock for the first quarter of any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors  including our future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  future prospects  regulatory restrictions  and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

index to financial statements the liquidity of fsgbank refers to the ability or financial flexibility to adjust its future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
one of the primary sources of funds for fsgbank is cash generated by repayments of outstanding loans  interest payments on loans  and new deposits 
additional liquidity is available from the maturity and earnings on securities and liquid assets  as well as the ability to liquidate securities available for sale 
as of december   our interest bearing account at the federal reserve bank of atlanta totaled approximately million 
this increase was funded through the issuance of brokered deposits in the fourth quarter of this excess liquidity is available to fund our contractual obligations and prudent investment opportunities 
as a member of the fhlb  fsgbank has attained short and long term borrowing capability secured by a blanket lien on its qualifying family first mortgage loan portfolio 
as of december   the outstanding term borrowings were thousand 
fsgbank also used its borrowing capacity at the fhlb to purchase a million letter of credit that we pledged to the state of tennessee bank collateral pool 
the letter of credit allows us to release investment securities from the collateral pool and thus improve our liquidity ratio 
as of december   our unused borrowing capacity using family first mortgage loans at the fhlb was million compared to million using family first mortgage and commercial real estate loans at year end the fhlb maintains standards for loan collateral files as well as asset quality 
therefore  our borrowing capacity may be restricted if our asset quality reaches certain thresholds or if collateral files have exceptions  such as expired property insurance 
fsgbank also had unsecured federal funds lines in the aggregate amount of million at december  under which it can borrow funds to meet short term liquidity needs 
the federal funds lines were fully available at year end another source of funding is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the servicing rights 
as of year end  we had million in loan participations sold 
fsgbank may continue to sell loan participations as a source of liquidity 
we may also pledge investment securities against a line of credit at a commercial bank as an additional source of short term funding 
as of year end  we had no borrowings against our investment securities  except for repurchase agreements and public fund deposits attained in the ordinary course of business 
we utilize brokered deposits to provide an additional source of funding for loan growth 
as of december   we had million in brokered cds outstanding with a weighted average remaining life of approximately months  a weighted average coupon rate of and a weighted average all in cost which includes fees paid to deposit brokers of 
additionally  we had million in brokered money market accounts and brokered now accounts 
our cdars product had million at december   with a weighted average coupon rate of and a weighted average remaining life of approximately months 
our certificates of deposit greater than thousand were generated in our communities and are considered relatively stable 
during  we were approved to use the federal reserve discount window 
we applied to utilize the federal reserve window as an abundance of caution due to the economic climate 
management believes that our liquidity sources are adequate to meet our operating needs 
we continue to study our contingency funding plans and update them as needed paying particular attention to the sensitivity of our liquidity and deposit base to positive and negative changes in our asset quality 
first security also has contractual cash obligations and commitments  which included certificates of deposit  other borrowings  operating leases and loan commitments 
unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled million and million at year end  respectively 
the following table illustrates our significant contractual obligations at december  by future payment period

net cash provided by operations in totaled million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
cash flows from operations in were reduced primarily due to increased in other assets  partially offset by higher net earnings before provision expense and the goodwill impairment 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in interest bearing deposits in banks 
this increase totaled million for  which is principally the increase in our federal reserve bank of atlanta interest bearing account 
this increase was partially offset by the change in net loan originations and payments 
for  loan principal collections exceeded originations by million compared to originations exceeding principal collections by million and million for and  respectively 
net cash flows from financing activities increased to million compared to million and million in  respectively 
the increase in is a result of the million received as part of the tarp investment and an increase in deposits compared to capital resources banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the occ and the federal reserve board  the primary federal regulators for fsgbank and first security  respectively  have adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated 
table of contents 
index to financial statements with various types of assets 
financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to their assets in accordance with the guidelines 
first security and fsgbank both maintain capital levels exceeding the minimum capital levels required in addition to exceeding those capital requirements for well capitalized banks and holding companies under applicable regulatory guidelines 
the following table compares the required capital ratios maintained by first security and fsgbank 
regulatory capital ratios december  well capitalized adequately capitalized first security fsgbank tier capital to risk adjusted assets total capital to risk adjusted assets leverage ratio december  well capitalized adequately capitalized first security fsgbank tier capital to risk adjusted assets total capital to risk adjusted assets leverage ratio the federal reserve board definition of well capitalized for bank holding companies does not include a leverage ratio component  accordingly  the leverage ratio requirement for well capitalized status only applies to fsgbank 
in october  we engaged a nationally recognized  independent consulting firm to complete a stress test of our loan portfolio and to gauge the potential impact of future deterioration in asset quality on our capital position based on different economic scenarios 
the method for stress testing the portfolio was based on the technique used by the federal regulators to evaluate the nation s largest financial institutions in the supervisory capital assessment program 
the results from this stress test are not a prediction of the most likely scenario that exists for us  but rather provide an estimate of losses that we might incur if the current economic environment continues to worsen under certain adverse scenarios 
the primary purpose of the stress test was to analyze the adequacy of our capital position against the risks inherent in our loan portfolio in an environment consisting of extremely detrimental economic circumstances 
the stress test was tailored to reflect the risk inherent in our portfolio and markets 
in december  the independent consulting firm completed the stress test  which indicated that  assuming first security experienced the credit losses projected under a more adverse scenario  we would need to raise and downstream to fsgbank a minimal amount of approximately thousand to satisfy current regulatory well capitalized standards at december  the review also found we would need to raise and downstream to fsgbank approximately million to satisfy these standards if it repaid all tarp funds 
in the event that the occ requires fsgbank to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least  we would need to raise and downstream to fsgbank approximately million to satisfy these standards  assuming that the tarp funds are not repaid 
on january   to further preserve our capital resources  our board of directors elected to suspend the dividend on our common stock and elected to defer the dividend payment on our series a preferred stock for the first quarter of any future determination relating to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors  including our future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  future prospects  regulatory restrictions  and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
effect of governmental policies we are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the national money supply 

table of contents 
index to financial statements among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board are purchases and sales of us government securities in the marketplace  changes in the discount rate  which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the federal reserve  and changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions 
these instruments are effective in influencing economic and monetary growth  interest rate levels and inflation 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
because of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money markets  as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities  it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates  deposit levels or loan demand or whether the changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings 
legislation from time to time is introduced in the united states congress and the tennessee general assembly and other state legislatures  and regulations are proposed by the regulatory agencies that could affect our business 
it cannot be predicted whether or in what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected thereby 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
such commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments 
we follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our maximum exposure to credit risk for unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit at december  and  was as follows unfunded loan commitments in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral  if any  we obtain on an extension of credit is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
recent accounting developments as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the financial accounting standards board fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification in june the codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap  other than guidance issued by the sec

table of contents 
index to financial statements registrants 
all guidance contained in the fasb accounting standards codification carries an equal level of authority  with this statement superseding all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards as of its effective date 
following this statement  the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts 
instead  it will issue accounting standard updates asus that will serve only to update the codification 
the following items represent accounting changes that have been issued but are not currently effective 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for accounting changes that became effective during the current periods 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which updates asc to require disclosure of significant transfers into and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy  as well as disclosure of an entity s policy for determining when transfers between all levels of the hierarchy are recognized 
asc  as amended  also provides enhanced disclosure requirements regarding purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements related to recurring level measurements  and requires separate disclosure in the level reconciliation of total gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income 
the updated provisions of asc require that fair value measurement disclosures be provided by each class of assets and liabilities  and that disclosures providing a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value be included for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements classified as either level or level the provisions of asu are effective for periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis which will be effective for periods beginning after december  comparative disclosures are required only for periods ending subsequent to initial adoption 
we are currently assessing the effects of adopting the provisions of asu in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  measuring liabilities at fair value  which updates asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the updated guidance clarifies that the fair value of a liability can be measured in relation to the quoted price of the liability when it trades as an asset in an active market  without adjusting the price for restrictions that prevent the sale of the liability 
this guidance is effective beginning october  we are currently assessing the effects of adopting this guidance 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides for the removal of the qualifying special purpose entity qspe concept from gaap  resulting in the evaluation of all former qspes for consolidation on and after january  in accordance with gaap 
the guidance modifies the criteria for achieving sale accounting for transfers of financial assets and defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
the guidance also provides that a transferor should recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained including a transferor s beneficial interest and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
the guidance requires enhanced disclosures which are generally consistent with  and supersede  the disclosures previously required by gaap 
the guidance is effective prospectively for new transfers of financial assets occurring in fiscal years beginning after november   and in interim periods within those fiscal years 
the new disclosure requirements should be applied to transfers that occurred both before and after its effective date  with comparative disclosures required only for periods subsequent to initial adoption for those disclosures not previously required under gaap 
we are currently assessing the effects of adopting this guidance 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that revises the criteria for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie by replacing the prior quantitative based risks and rewards test with a qualitative analysis 
additionally  the guidance requires continual reconsideration of conclusions regarding which interest holder is the vie s primary beneficiary 
this guidance is effective for periods beginning after november   and requires reevaluation under its amended consolidation requirements of all qspes and entities currently subject to fin r as of the beginning of the first annual period that begins after november  we are currently assessing the effects of adopting this guidance 

table of contents 
index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk  with respect to first security  is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the risk of loss can result in either lower fair market values or reduced net interest income 
we manage several types of risk  such as credit  liquidity and interest rate 
we consider interest rate risk to be a significant risk that could potentially have a large material effect on our financial condition 
further  we process hypothetical scenarios whereby we shock our balance sheet up and down for possible interest rate changes  we analyze the potential change positive or negative to net interest income  as well as the effect of changes in fair market values of assets and liabilities 
we do not deal in international instruments  and therefore are not exposed to the risks inherent to foreign currency 
additionally  as of december   we had no trading assets that exposed us to the risks in market changes 
our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of our board of directors asset liability committee alco 
the committee has established policies and limits for management to monitor  measure and coordinate our sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense associated with our interest sensitive assets and liabilities also change  thereby impacting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco utilizes the results of both a static and dynamic gap report  as well as an income simulation report  to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to a sustained change in interest rates 
we monitor and forecast potential interest rate changes based on market data 
in a falling interest rate environment  we closely monitor our funding sources and pricing to minimize the impact to our net interest margin for our asset sensitive balance sheet 
the income simulation analysis projects net interest income based on both a rise and fall in interest rates of basis points ie over a twelve month period 
the model is based on actual repricing dates of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets 
we measure this exposure based on an immediate change in interest rates of basis points up or down 
given this scenario  we had  at year end  an exposure to falling rates and a benefit from rising rates 
more specifically  the model forecasts a decline in net interest income of million  or  as a result of a basis point decline in rates 
the model also predicts a million increase in net interest income  or  as a result of a basis point increase in rates 
the forecasted results of the model for the basis point increase are within the limits specified by our guidelines 
the forecasted results for a decline in rates is not within our policy limit  however  a basis point decline in rates is not anticipated 
the following chart reflects first security s sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  the model is based on a static balance sheet and assumes that paydowns and maturities of both assets and liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments at current interest rates  rates down basis points  and rates up basis points

table of contents 
index to financial statements the preceding sensitivity analysis is a modeling analysis  which changes periodically and consists of hypothetical estimates based upon numerous assumptions including interest rate levels  shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  rates on loans and deposits  reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments and deposits  and other assumptions 
in addition  there is no input for growth or a change in asset mix 
while assumptions are developed based on the current economic and market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
we use the sendero vision asset liability system which is a comprehensive interest rate risk measurement tool that is widely used in the banking industry 
generally  it provides the user with the ability to more accurately model both static and dynamic gap  economic value of equity  duration  and income simulations using a wide range of scenarios including interest rate shocks and rate ramps 
the system also has the capability to model derivative instruments  such as interest rate swap contracts
