critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on cash advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
finance and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues finance and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of finance and service charges 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company can quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded finance and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the finance and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of finance and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of finance and service charges revenue was overestimated or underestimated by  finance and service charges revenue would decrease or increase by million in and net income attributable to the company would decrease or increase by million  net of taxes 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
any increase would be realized as additional service charge revenue 
merchandise held for disposition 
merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid and merchandise that is purchased directly from third parties or from customers 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral and other merchandise held for disposition is stated at the lower of cost cash amount loaned or market 
management provides an allowance for returns and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise and historical shrinkage rates 
because pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  including the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with disposing of similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on multiple occasions on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
allowance for losses on cash advances 
the company maintains either an allowance or accrual for losses on cash advances including fees and interest at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined company and third party lender portfolio the portion owned by independent third party lenders 
the allowance for losses on company owned cash advances offsets the outstanding cash advance amounts in the consolidated balance sheets 
active third party lender originated cash advances in which the company does not have a participation interest are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
an accrual for contingent losses on third party lender owned cash advances that are guaranteed by the company is maintained and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company aggregates and tracks cash advances written during each calendar month to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding combined portfolio by age  delinquency  and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
it uses historical collection performance adjusted for recent portfolio performance trends to develop the expected loss rates used to establish either the allowance or accrual 
increases in either the allowance or accrual are created by recording a cash advance loss provision in the consolidated statements of income 
the company typically charges off all cash advances once they have been in default for days  or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected 
the company s internet channel periodically sells selected cash advances that have been previously written off 
proceeds from these sales are recorded as recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance for losses 
at december   the allowance for losses on cash advances was million and accrued losses on third party lender owned cash advances were million  in aggregate representing of the combined cash advance portfolio 
during fiscal year  the cash advance loss provision for the combined cash advance portfolio  which increases the allowance for loan losses  was million and reflects of gross combined cash advances written by the company and third party lenders 
if future loss rates increased  or decreased  by  or from levels  the cash advance loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million and net income attributable to the company would decrease  or increase  by million  net of taxes  for  assuming the same volume of cash advances written in income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
asc requires that a more likely than not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured 
management must evaluate tax positions taken on the company s tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
management s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition under asc goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
in accordance with asc  goodwill subsequent measurement asc  the company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of june and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as defined in asc  the company has three reporting units pawn lending operations  cash advance operations and check cashing operations 
these reporting units offer products with similar economic characteristics and have discrete financial information which is regularly reviewed by executive management
