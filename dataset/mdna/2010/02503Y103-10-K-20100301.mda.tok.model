american capital investing activity we provide investment capital to middle market companies  which we generally consider to be companies with sales between million and million 
we invest in senior and subordinated debt in the buyouts of private companies sponsored by other private equity firms  directly to mature private and small public companies and into our current portfolio companies 
we will co invest senior and subordinated debt in one stop buyouts sponsored by equity funds that we manage that will provide the equity portion of the investments 
currently  we will invest up to million in a single middle market transaction in north america 
we also invest in structured products and alternative asset funds managed by us 
for summary financial information by geographic area  see the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
we seek to be a long term partner with our portfolio companies 
as a long term partner  we will invest capital in a portfolio company subsequent to our initial investment if we believe that it can achieve appropriate returns for our investment 
add on financings fund i strategic acquisitions by a portfolio company of either a complete business or specific lines of a business that are related to the portfolio company s business  ii recapitalization of a portfolio company to raise financing on better terms  buyout one or several owners or to pay a dividend  iii growth of the portfolio company such as product development or plant expansions  or iv working capital for a portfolio company  sometimes in distressed situations  that need capital to fund operating costs  debt service  or growth in receivables or inventory 
the total value of our investment portfolio was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
our new investments totaled billion  billion and billion during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the amounts of our new investments include both funded commitments and unfunded commitments as of the investment date 
during the 
table of contents year ended december   we generally limited our investment originations to providing funding to our existing portfolio companies for working capital or to recapitalize or refinance their balance sheets  primarily to preserve our investments 
since our asset coverage ratio was below and our net asset value per share was greater than the trading price of our common stock during the year ended december   regulatory restrictions limited our ability to raise debt or equity capital during the year to be able to make significant new investments 
in addition  we have increased the cash balance on our balance sheet with any realization of proceeds from the exit of portfolio investments during the year ended december  in anticipation of restructuring our debt obligations and delevering our balance sheet instead of reinvesting the proceeds into new investments 
the type and aggregate dollar amount of our new investments during the years ended december   and were as follows in millions investments in managed funds financing for private equity buyouts american capital sponsored buyouts direct investments structured products add on financing for working capital in distressed situations add on financing for recapitalizations add on financing for growth and working capital add on financing for acquisitions total we continued to produce significant liquidity in through the realizations of our portfolio investments 
however  the overall reduction in realizations from and was driven primarily by reduced global m a activity 
during the years ended december   and  we received cash proceeds from realizations and repayments of portfolio investments as follows in millions loan syndications and sales sale of equity investments principal prepayments payment of accrued pik interest and dividend and original issue discounts scheduled principal amortization sale of cmbs securities total results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
our consolidated financial performance  as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations  is composed of the following three primary elements the first element is net operating income  which is primarily the interest  dividends and prepayment fees earned from investing in debt and equity securities and the fees we earn from portfolio company management  asset management  financing and transaction structuring activities  less our operating expenses and provision for income taxes 

table of contents the second element is net realized loss gain on investments  which reflects the difference between the proceeds from an exit of an investment and the cost at which the investment was carried on our consolidated balance sheets and periodic interest settlements and termination receipts or payments on derivatives  foreign currency transaction gains or losses and income taxes on realized gains 
the third element is net unrealized depreciation of investments  which is the net change in the estimated fair value of our portfolio investments and of our interest rate derivatives at the end of the period compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period or their stated costs  as appropriate 
in addition  our net unrealized depreciation of investments includes the foreign currency translation from converting assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar 
the consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions operating income operating expenses operating income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net operating income net gain on extinguishment of debt net realized loss gain on investments net realized loss earnings net unrealized depreciation of investments net loss earnings fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating income we derive the majority of our operating income by investing in senior and subordinated debt and equity of middle market companies with attractive current yields and or potential for equity appreciation and realized gains 
we also derive operating income from investing in structured products 
operating income consisted of the following for the years ended december  and in millions interest income on debt and structured product investments dividend income interest income on bank deposits interest and dividend income fund asset management fees and reimbursements portfolio company advisory and administrative fees loan financing fees other fees asset management and other fee income total operating income 
table of contents interest and dividend income interest income on debt and structured product investments decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for  due to a decrease in our monthly weighted average debt and structured product investments and a decline in the weighted average effective interest rate 
dividend income decreased by million  or  to million for from million for  primarily due to a decline in the effective dividend yield 
the following table summarizes selected data for our debt and equity investments  at cost  for the years ended december  and dollars in millions effective interest rate on debt investments debt investments average monthly one month libor average non accrual loans at cost average non accrual loans at fair value effective dividend yield on equity investments equity investments effective yield on debt and equity investments debt and equity investments monthly weighted average 
includes structured products 
quarterly average 
our weighted average debt and structured product investments decreased during as we have chosen to accumulate cash on our balance sheet from any realization of proceeds from the exit of portfolio investments during the year ended december  in anticipation of restructuring our debt obligations and delevering our balance sheet instead of reinvesting the proceeds into new investments 
the monthly weighted average effective interest rate on debt investments decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this is primarily due to i a basis point decrease in the average one month libor from the prior year  ii an increase in non accrual loans  iii partially offset by an increase in the interest spreads on recent loan originations and modifications 
a portion of our debt investments  particularly our senior debt investments  accrue interest at libor plus a spread 
these loans either have no libor floor or may have a libor floor that is generally around 
as a result  as libor declines  our interest income generally will decline for our loans that are based on libor 
our average quarterly non accrual loans as a percentage of our total loans at cost increased in as compared to the prior year as the impact of the recent economic recession has negatively impacted the performance of certain of our portfolio companies 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  we record reserves on uncollected pik interest income recorded in prior periods as a reduction of interest income in the current period 
for the year ended december   we recorded reserves on uncollected pik interest income recorded in prior periods of million  which had an approximately basis point impact on the weighted average effective interest rate for the year ended december  the interest income we earn on our debt investments was generally positively impacted by loans that were originated or modified during and these recent new loans originations have been priced at generally higher spreads as compared to loans that have been repaid during this period as market spreads have increased during this period 

table of contents the monthly weighted average effective dividend yield on equity investments decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this is primarily due to i a lower accrual of dividends on our preferred stock investments of our private finance portfolio  ii discontinuation of dividends from our investment in european capital and iii lower dividends from our investment in american capital  llc 
for the year ended december   we recorded reserves on uncollected accrued dividend income recorded in prior periods from private finance preferred stock investments of million  which are recorded as a reduction of dividend income in the current period 
the reserves on accrued dividend income were recorded because we no longer expect such amounts to be collected or realized 
we recorded dividend income on our equity investment in european capital of million for the year ended december  we did not record any dividend income on our equity investment in european capital for the year ended december  to the extent american capital  llc declares dividends of its net operating income to us  such dividends would be included as dividend income 
the net operating income of american capital  llc is comprised of the base management fees  profit sharing called carried interest or incentive fee and transaction fees it earns less the operating expenses it incurs for providing fund management services 
for the year ended december   american capital  llc declared dividends of million compared to dividends of million for year ended december  the decrease in dividend income is attributable primarily to lower net operating income from american capital  llc due to lower management fee income earned from managing european capital 
asset management and other fee income as of december   all of our third party alternative asset fund management services are conducted through our wholly owned portfolio company  american capital  llc 
fund asset management fees and reimbursements revenue for the years ended december  and represent fees of million and million  respectively  for providing advisory and administrative services to american capital  llc 
our asset management and other fee income includes financial advisory services provided to our portfolio company investments and includes both management fees for providing managerial advice and analysis to our middle market portfolio companies  which can be recurring in nature  and transaction structuring and financing fees for structuring  financing and executing middle market portfolio transactions  which may not be recurring in nature 
during the year ended december   we did not complete any american capital sponsored buyouts and did not provide any financing in buyouts sponsored by other private equity firms 
as a result  we did not earn any loan financing  equity financing or transaction structuring fees for the year ended december  operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from operating expenses consisted of the following for the years ended december  and in millions interest salaries  benefits and stock based compensation general and administrative total operating expenses 
table of contents interest interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates for default interest and ratings downgrades and a make whole interest payment  partially offset by a decline in libor and lower weighted average borrowings 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  we are in default under certain of our unsecured borrowing arrangements 
we incurred additional interest expense of million during the year ended december  as a result of higher interest rates due to the defaults on certain of our borrowing arrangements and rating agency downgrades 
in addition  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  we incurred interest expense of million during the year ended december  for a make whole interest payment associated with the acceleration of our unsecured private debt for which we subsequently entered into forbearance agreements 
the million make whole interest payment was added to the outstanding principal amounts of the unsecured private notes in accordance with the forbearance agreements 
the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings  including amortization of deferred financing costs and the make whole interest payment accrual  for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  our weighted average borrowings decreased to  million for the year ended december  from  million in the comparable period in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation salaries  benefits and stock based compensation consisted of the following for the years ended december  and in millions base salaries incentive compensation severance costs benefits stock based compensation total salaries  benefits and stock based compensation salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for the year ended december  increased million  or  from primarily due to i a one time acceleration of stock based compensation in from a tender offer of employee stock options  ii an increase in incentive compensation  iii partially offset by a decrease in the number of employees from in december  we completed a tender offer for certain eligible outstanding employee stock options 
pursuant to the tender offer  we offered employees a cash payment for the voluntary cancellation of certain eligible outstanding employee stock options 
for each tendered stock option  non executive officer employees received a cash payment of per eligible stock option and executive officer employees received per eligible stock option 
as a result of the tender offer  approximately million was accelerated and recorded as stock based compensation for the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
our incentive compensation during the year ended december  increased by million from as a result of retention bonus accruals implemented in to better align our organization and cost structure with current economic conditions  we undertook strategic reviews of our business in and which resulted in aggregate restructuring charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the restructuring charges included million and million  respectively  for severance and related costs associated with and employees for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the severance and related costs are included in 
table of contents salaries  benefits and stock based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   and  we had total employees of   and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from the increase is primarily due to i non recurring professional fees of million for the year ended december  from both our and our unsecured creditors legal and financial advisors that have been engaged in connection with our debt restructuring negotiations  ii million in restructuring charges related to excess facilities due to office closures and employee headcount reductions for the year ended december  as compared to million in  iii partially offset by lower overall general and administrative expenses due to fewer employees and offices in as compared to benefit provision for income taxes as a ric  we are subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of if we do not distribute at least of our ordinary income  excluding net short term capital gains  in any calendar year and of our capital gains for each one year period ending october  including any undistributed income from the prior excise tax year 
for the calendar year ended december  and the one year period ending october   we did not distribute at least of our ordinary income and capital gains and accrued the excise tax 
for the year ended december   we accrued million of excise tax attributable to undistributed ordinary income  which is included in our benefit provision for income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december  and one year period ending october  we distributed at least of our ordinary income and capital gains and did not accrue excise tax 
the final taxable income included in our excise tax return for the calendar year ended december  and the one year period ending october  resulted in a lower taxable income than the estimated taxable income used to accrue the million excise tax for the year ended december  as a result of this change in estimate  we accrued an million income tax benefit for the year ended december  related to excise taxes  which is included in our benefit provision for income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

for the year ended december   we accrued a tax benefit of million compared to a tax provision of million for we use the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether our deferred tax asset is realizable  we consider the forecasted future taxable income of acfs as well as any tax planning strategies 
considering the macroeconomic environment as of december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax asset with future taxable income of acfs 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset in substantially most of our million tax provision for acfs in related to our recording of a valuation allowance 
as of december   we continued to conclude that it is more likely than not that we would not realize our deferred tax asset with future taxable income of acfs and have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
we will continue to evaluate the valuation allowance each reporting period  and if we determine that it is more likely than not that the realizable amount of the deferred tax asset exceeds the valuation allowance  we would reduce the valuation allowance 
during the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit of million related to acfs 
on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted 
as part of this legislation  the carryback period for net operating losses arising in either or was increased from two years to three  four or five years at the election of the taxpayer 
as a result of this new legislation  acfs was able to carryback its net operating loss for the tax year ended september  to prior years to claim a refund 
this resulted in american capital recording a tax benefit of million for the year ended december   which is included in our benefit provision for income taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

private finance portfolio our private finance portfolio investments consist of loans and equity securities primarily to privately held middle market companies 
there is generally no publicly available information about these companies and an active primary or secondary market for the trading of these privately issued loans and securities generally does not exist 
our investments have been historically exited through normal repayment or a change in control transaction such as a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  we adopted sfas no 
 which is codified in fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc on january  as a result of the adoption of asc  we were required to modify our valuation methodologies for certain of our private finance investments 
prior to the adoption of asc  we generally determined the fair value of our private finance portfolio investments by using the enterprise value waterfall enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
this valuation approach results in the determination of a fair value of our investments based on a change of control in an m a transaction or a recapitalization of the enterprise based on the value of the enterprise 
however  upon the adoption of asc  for investments in debt and redeemable preferred equity securities of portfolio companies for which we do not have the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date and for which there is no active market  we are required under asc to use a hypothetical secondary market as our principal market 
we determine the fair value based on the assumptions that hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using the market yield market yield valuation methodology 
as of december   we have recognized million of cumulative net unrealized depreciation as a result of using a market yield valuation methodology instead of the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
we intend to hold these private finance portfolio investments until settlement or maturity which would generally be on a change of control event such as a sale or recapitalization of the company 
in general  we do not intend to exit these investments in a secondary market where the sale proceeds would be based on a market yield 
accordingly  we do not expect to realize this million of cumulative net unrealized depreciation if we hold the investments to settlement or maturity and there are no significant unanticipated credit impairments 
however  we may decide to sell certain of our debt investments prior to settlement or maturity in which the sale price would be based on a market yield 

table of contents for the year ended december   the million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments was driven primarily by portfolio company performance and credit 
the declines related to portfolio company performance and credit for the year ended december  were driven mostly by declines in the operating results of certain of our portfolio companies due to the recent global economic recession 
from a trend perspective  we experienced a significant amount of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments during the first half of while recognizing modest net unrealized appreciation on our private finance portfolio in the second half of for the year ended december   the  million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio included approximately million of net unrealized depreciation as a result of the change in our accounting methodologies from the adoption of asc the remaining  million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments during was driven primarily by a combination of declines in multiples of comparable companies and portfolio company performance and credit for certain of our portfolio companies due to the recent global economic recession  particularly in the second half of european capital for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized depreciation of million on our investment in european capital 
as of december   our investment in european capital consisted of a equity investment with a cost basis and fair value of  million and million  respectively  as well as an unsecured revolving credit facility investment with a fair value of million 
in the first quarter of  we acquired the remaining equity interest not already owned by us 
european capital is an investment fund that invests in and sponsors management and employee buyouts  invests in private equity buyouts and provides capital directly to private and mid sized public companies primarily in europe 
it primarily invests in senior debt  subordinated debt and equity 
european capital s underlying portfolio investments are recorded at fair value determined in accordance with gaap and asc in determining the fair value of our investment in european capital  we concluded that our wholly owned equity investment should be less than the nav of european capital due to the risks associated with our ability to realize the full fair value of european capital s underlying assets for several reasons  including european capital negotiating the restructuring of its credit facilities with its lenders as of the measurement date  and recent comparable transactions and public comparables  which indicate fair values at a discount to nav 
the unrealized depreciation of million during the year ended december  is due primarily to a decrease in the nav of european capital primarily as a result of a decline in the fair value of its portfolio investments during the year 
the following is a summary composition of european capital s nav and our equity investment s implied discount to its nav as of december  in millions debt investments at fair value equity investments at fair value other assets and liabilities  net secured debt at cost unsecured debt at cost unsecured debt from american capital at cost net asset value exchange rate net asset value in dollars fair value of american capital equity investment implied discount to nav 
table of contents as of december   european capital was publicly traded on the london stock exchange under the ticker symbol ecas 
the fair value of european capital as of december  was based on the market quote as of december  plus a control premium because our board of directors determined that additional value above the market quote would be obtainable upon transfer of control 
the unrealized depreciation of million during the year ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in the closing market quote as of december  agnc for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized appreciation of million on our investment in agnc due to an increase in the closing market quote and the elimination in the discount to the market quote for certain sales restrictions that have lapsed 
american capital  llc american capital  llc  a wholly owned portfolio company of american capital  is a holding company of wholly owned third party fund managers 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of unrealized depreciation on our investment in american capital  llc 
the funds managed by american capital  llc are european capital  agnc  ace i  ace ii  acas clo and acas cre cdo 
the decline in value of american capital  llc for the years ended december  and is primarily due to a decline in its projected cash flows from reduced projected management fees and carried interest for managing european capital due in part to a decline in the fair value of european capital s investments 
structured products american capital has investments in structured products such as investment and non investment grade tranches of cmbs  clo and cdo securities 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of net unrealized depreciation on our structured products investments 
our cmbs portfolio  which includes a commercial real estate cdo  experienced million and million of net unrealized depreciation during the years ended december  and  respectively  and our clo and cdo portfolios of commercial loans experienced million of net unrealized appreciation during the year ended december  and million of net unrealized depreciation during the year ended december  we value our structured products investments using the market yield valuation methodology 
we estimate fair value based on third party broker quotes  sale transactions of identical or similar securities and our cash flow forecasts subject to our assumptions a market participant would use regarding the investments underlying collateral including  but not limited to  assumptions of default and recovery rates  reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates 
cash flow forecasts are discounted using a market participant s market yield assumptions that are derived from multiple sources including  but not limited to  third party broker quotes  industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structure and risk characteristics 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
we considered that the current market for our structured products investments may be considered an inactive market and that the information used by the third party brokers to develop the quotes  if any  may generally not be based on actual transactions 
for the year ended december   the net unrealized depreciation of million and million in our cmbs and clo cdo portfolios  respectfully  was driven primarily by a dramatic widening of the investments spreads from origination caused by the liquidity crisis in the market as well as credit performance  particularly in our cmbs portfolio 
the liquidity crisis drove investors expected returns higher on structured

a negative fair value would represent an amount we would have to pay a third party and a positive fair value would represent an amount we would receive from a third party to assume our obligation under an interest rate derivative agreement

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

private finance portfolio during the year ended december   we recorded  million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments  including million of net unrealized depreciation as a result of the change in our accounting methodologies from the adoption of asc the remaining  million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments during was driven primarily by declines in multiples of comparable companies and reduction of historic and projected cash flows of certain portfolio companies 
under the market yield valuation methodology  the net unrealized depreciation of million for the year ended december  was driven by a significant increase in expected current market yields and interest rate spreads of similar loans or securities as well as a decline in libor 
for example  the merrill lynch year bb us cash pay high yield index as of december  increased approximately basis points as compared to the prior year 
this index tracks us denominated debt  currently in a coupon paying period that is publicly issued in the us domestic market with a remaining term to maturity greater than or equal to years and less than years and rated bb through bb however  we estimate that the privately held middle market loan pricing as of december  has increased over basis points for senior debt and over basis points for subordinated debt as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the one month libor as of december  decreased by over basis points as compared to the prior year 
the remaining  million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio was driven primarily by declines in multiples of comparable companies and reduction of historical and projected cash flows of certain portfolio companies 
under the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology  we estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company by preparing an analysis consisting of traditional valuation methodologies including market  income and cost approaches 
we weight some or all of the traditional valuation methods based on individual circumstances of the portfolio company 
three of the more significant traditional valuation methodologies used are valuations of comparable public companies  recent sales of private and public comparable companies  and discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company 
during  the trading multiples of comparable public companies have declined significantly 
for example  the wilshire index declined during the wilshire index is a common index that measures the performance of the stocks for nearly every traded public company in the united states 
also  recent sales of private and public 
table of contents comparable companies also reflect lower multiples 
in addition  the performance of certain of our portfolio companies deteriorated during due to both global macroeconomic factors due to the economic recession as well as individual performance issues at certain portfolio companies resulting in a decline of cash flows 
of our  million of remaining net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio during the year ended december   we estimate that approximately two thirds was due to multiple compression and approximately one third was due to portfolio company performance 
managed funds for the year ended december   the net unrealized depreciation of our managed funds was million  consisting primarily of million of unrealized depreciation on our investment in european capital 
as of december   we owned a controlling majority owned interest in european capital  a company that was publicly traded on the london stock exchange under the ticker symbol ecas 
as outlined in our accounting policy and in accordance with the act for determining fair value  for securities of companies that are publicly traded for which we have a majority owned interest  the value is based on the market quote on the valuation date plus a control premium if our board of directors determines in good faith that additional value above the market quote would be obtainable upon transfer of control 
as of december  and  european capital s closing market quote was and per share  respectively 
as of december  and  the fair value of our controlling majority owned equity interest in european capital was determined to be and per share  respectively  which was based on the closing market quote plus a control premium of and  respectively 
the million of unrealized depreciation in our investment in european capital during the year ended december  was driven primarily by a decrease in the market quote from december  to december  including the impact of foreign currency translation  our equity investment in european capital was valued at million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a control premium was applied to the market quote as it was determined in good faith by our board of directors that additional value above the market quote would be obtainable upon the sale of our controlling interest in european capital 
the purchaser of the majority owned controlling interest in european capital would have the ability to realize the net asset value and take advantage of synergies and other benefits that would result from control over european capital 
american capital  llc during the year ended december   we recognized million of unrealized depreciation on our investment in american capital  llc compared to million of unrealized appreciation in the comparable period in this decline was primarily driven by a decrease in the trading multiples of comparable asset management companies and a decline in its projected management and incentive fees due to lower projected transaction fees and a decline in the growth rate of assets under management 
the projected lower transaction fees are due to lower projected investment originations of the alternative asset funds under its management 
the decline in projected assets under management of american capital  llc is due in part to additional unrealized depreciation as a result of changes to accounting valuation policies upon the adoption of asc by the third party alternative asset funds managed by american capital  llc  primarily european capital 
structured products during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized depreciation on our structured products investments compared to million for the comparable period in our cmbs portfolio  which includes a commercial real estate cdo  experienced million of net unrealized depreciation and our commercial clo and cdo portfolios experienced million of net unrealized depreciation during the year ended december  the million of net unrealized depreciation during the year ended december  and the accumulated net unrealized depreciation as of december  of million was driven primarily by dramatic widening of the investments spreads caused by the liquidity crisis in the market 
the liquidity crisis has 
table of contents driven investors expected returns higher on structured products investments 
in general  there is not a liquid market for our non investment grade structured products investments 
however  there have been a few trades of securities of similar structured products investments in what is considered to be an illiquid distressed market during  which has had the effect of decreasing the values of the overall structured products market 
foreign currency translation during the year ended december   the foreign currency translation adjustment recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net unrealized depreciation was million  primarily as a result of the euro depreciating against the us dollar 
derivative and option agreements during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized depreciation from derivative and option agreements 
we recorded million of net unrealized depreciation from interest rate derivative agreements  and million of net unrealized depreciation from a put option agreement 
the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivative agreements during the year ended december  is primarily due to a decrease in the forward interest rate yield curve as a result of the decline in libor 
as of december   we were party to a put option agreement with european capital under which european capital can put some or all of certain investments to us at a predetermined put price of million approximately million as of december  
under the terms of the agreement  the put option may be exercised at any time commencing on january  and expiring on december  if  prior to january   the investments are sold to a third party for less than the predetermined put price  we would have been required to pay european capital an amount equal to the difference between the predetermined put price and the amount received on the sale 
in consideration for entering the put option  european capital paid us a premium of million million which is included on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability 
during the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized depreciation of million on the put option agreement primarily due to a decrease in fair value of the portfolio investments of european capital subject to the put option agreement 
return on shareholders equity the following table summarizes our returns on shareholders equity for the years ended december  and net operating income return on average shareholders equity at cost net realized earnings return on average shareholders equity at cost net loss earnings return on average shareholders equity financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the economic recession and crisis in the global credit markets during the past two years has adversely affected all industry sectors 
we suffered significant deprecation  higher defaults and losses in many of our investments  and as a result became overlevered and defaulted on our primary unsecured arrangements 
additionally we believe that the economic recession and global financial has resulted in fewer firms interested in financing assets or businesses  tighter lending standards and reduced access to capital 
the economic recession and global financial crisis has contributed to a decline in earnings and or decline in valuation multiples for our portfolio companies and widened the investment spreads on structured products and certain of our private finance debt investments causing decreases in the fair value of these investments 
although we began to experience some signs of stabilization during the latter part of in the earnings and valuation multiples of our portfolio companies and in the investments spreads on our structured products and private finance debt investments  we may experience volatile market swings that could lead to a further decline in earnings and or 
table of contents decline in valuation multiples for our portfolio companies or could lead to further widening of investment spreads on structured products or private finance debt investments causing a further decrease in the fair value of these investments 
although we cannot predict future market conditions  we believe that our continuing ability to generate positive operating cash flows and sell existing portfolio investments will provide us with adequate liquidity to execute our current business strategy including the payment of our debt service and the minimum amount of dividends to maintain our qualification as a ric 
there is no certainty that we will generate sufficient liquidity from these realizations to meet our needs 
however  to the extent that the capital markets improve  we may elect to raise new capital 
currently  our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our portfolio investments 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 
our restricted cash and cash equivalents consists primarily of collections of interest and principal payments on assets that are securitized 
in accordance with the terms of the related securitized debt agreements  based on current characteristics of the securitized loan portfolios  those funds are generally used each quarter to pay interest and principal on the securitized debt and are not distributed to us or available for our general operations 
during the year ended december   we received cash proceeds from the realizations of portfolio investments of billion 
during the year ended december   we principally funded our operations  including our investing activities  from i cash receipts from interest  dividend and fee income from our investment portfolio and ii cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments through the repayments of loan investments  the sale of loan and equity investments 
operating and investing cash flow historically  our investment portfolio has generated a substantial amount of operating cash flow from interest  dividends and fees 
for the years ended december  and  we generated million and million of cash flow from operations  respectively 
one of our other sources of liquidity is our investment portfolio 
for the years ended december  and  we received net cash from investing activities totaling million and million  respectively 
included in our cash from investing activities were cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments totaling billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had portfolio investments totaling billion at fair value  including billion in debt investments  billion in equity investments and billion in structured products 
our investments are generally illiquid and no active primary or secondary market for the trading of these investments exists 
we are generally repaid our investments upon a change of control event of the portfolio company such as sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
we currently have several portfolio companies in various stages of the sale process  however  there are no assurances that we will be able to realize proceeds from our investments in the future 
due to our deleveraging efforts during  our investment portfolio at cost decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  our private finance debt portfolio  which is the significant contributor to our operating income and our operating cash flows  also decreased from billion at cost as of december  to billion at cost as of december  in addition  the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in our private finance debt portfolio and the increase in our cost of capital during  our operating cash flows decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we expect our private finance debt portfolio to continue to decrease as we continue our deleveraging efforts  and we also expect that our cost of borrowing will increase in as a result of the proposed restructuring 
though  we believe that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow through the receipt of interest  dividend and fee payments from our investment portfolio  as well as the disposition of select portfolio investments  to allow us to continue to service our debt  pay our operating costs and expenses  pay dividends to maintain our status as a ric and fund capital to our current portfolio companies

table of contents the lock up agreement also contains an agreement by the lenders to forbear from exercising remedies resulting from defaults by us under the credit facility  until the earlier of i the consummation of the exchange transaction or commencement of a restructuring case  ii the date on which any holder of our private unsecured notes or public unsecured notes commences litigation or an involuntary case under title eleven of the united states code against us  iv the date on which any one or more creditors of us with claims in excess of million commence litigation against us or v any other filing of an involuntary case under title eleven of the united states code against us 
the lock up agreement generally requires all of the lenders under the credit facility to agree to the proposed restructuring assuming specified conditions are met 
however  the lock up agreement may be terminated if various stages of the proposed restructuring are not completed by certain dates 
these deadlines were extended twice in january currently  the lock up agreement may be terminated i upon consummation of the exchange transaction and the effective date of the plan or a written agreement to terminate the lock up agreement  ii if the exchange transaction is not consummated in accordance with the proposed restructuring and we have not commenced a restructuring case by march  unless the administrative agent under the credit facility agrees to an extension of not later than march  or iii if we commence a restructuring case and any material order is entered that is inconsistent with the lock up agreement or the proposed restructuring  which is objected to by a majority of the lenders  an order finding that the solicitation complying with applicable law and confirming the plan has not been entered on or before may  unless the administrative agent under the credit facility agrees to an extension of not later than may  or the plan is not consummated by may   or the restructuring case is dismissed or converted to an accelerated case or a trustee or examiner shall have been appointed in the restructuring case 
in addition  either party may terminate the lock up agreement upon a breach of material obligations by the other party 
because we have not launched the exchange transaction as of the date of this filing and the tender offer rules under the securities exchange act of  as amended  require that such offers generally remain open for business days  it is likely that we will be unable to complete the exchange transaction by the above deadlines 
we may seek an amendment to the lock up agreement to further extend the deadline for consummating the exchange transaction or we may proceed with the proposed restructuring without a lock up agreement with the lenders under the credit facility 
we do not have a lock up agreement with our other unsecured creditors 
as noted above  if the requisite lenders and noteholders do not agree to the exchange transaction  we intend to implement the proposed restructuring by soliciting votes for the plan 
we expect that we will ultimately be successful in completing the proposed restructuring

portfolio credit quality we stop accruing interest on our investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
our valuation analysis serves as a critical piece of data in this determination

credit statistics we monitor several key credit statistics that provide information about credit quality and portfolio performance 
these key statistics include debt to ebitda ratio the sum of all debt with equal or senior security rights to our debt investments divided by the total adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  of the most recent twelve months or  when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
interest coverage ratio ebitda divided by the total scheduled cash interest payments required to have been made by the portfolio company during the most recent twelve month period  or when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
debt service coverage ratio ebitda divided by the total scheduled principal amortization and the total scheduled cash interest payments required to have been made during the most recent twelve month period  or when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
we generally require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited and monthly or quarterly unaudited financial statements 
using these financial statements  we calculate the statistics described above 
buyout and subordinated funds typically adjust ebitda due to the nature of change of control transactions 
such adjustments are intended to normalize and restate ebitda to reflect the pro forma results of a company in a change of control transaction 
for purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies  we make certain adjustments to ebitda to reflect the pro forma results of a company consistent with a change of control transaction in addition to adjusting ebitda for significant non recurring  unusual or infrequent items 
adjustments to ebitda may include anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring  costs related to new product development  compensation to previous owners  non recurring revenues or expenses  and other acquisition or restructuring related items

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its applications 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are the most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates

going concern a fundamental principle of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap is the assumption that an entity will continue in existence as a going concern  which contemplates continuity of operations and the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities occurring in the ordinary course of business 
this principle is applicable to all entities except for entities in liquidation or entities for which liquidation appears imminent 
in accordance with this requirement  our policy is to prepare our consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis unless we intend to liquidate or have no other alternative but to liquidate 
as a result of our default of various financial covenants under our borrowing arrangements  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
while we have prepared our consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis  if we are unable to successfully restructure our borrowing arrangements or we do not receive additional funding  our ability to continue as a going concern may be impacted 
therefore  we may not be able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k do not reflect any adjustments that might specifically result from the outcome of this uncertainty or our debt restructuring activities 
valuation of investments our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the act and asc in accordance with the act  unrestricted minority owned publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the valuation date and majority owned publicly traded securities and other privately held securities are valued as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
for unrestricted securities of companies that are publicly traded for which we have a majority owned interest  the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date plus a control premium if our board of directors determines in good faith that additional value above the closing market quote would be obtainable upon a sale or transfer of our controlling interest 
asc provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair 
table of contents value measurements on earnings 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp fas  which is codified in fasb asc asc 
fsp fas amended asc to provide additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
it emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same that the fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the guidance in asc as it relates to fsp fas is effective for periods ending after june  and is applied prospectively with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we adopted the requirements of asc as it relates to fsp fas during the quarter ended march  the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
asc defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs 
under asc  the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset 
the principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset 
in determining the principal market for an asset or liability under asc  it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to the market as of the measurement date 
if no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market  the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market 
the market in which we would sell our private finance investments is the m a market 
under asc  we have indentified the m a market as our principal market for portfolio companies only if we have the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date 
we determine whether we have the ability to initiate a sale of a portfolio company based on our ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date 
in evaluating if we can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date  we include our equity securities and those securities held by entities managed by american capital  llc  on a fully diluted basis 
for investments in portfolio companies for which we do not have the ability to control or gain control as of the measurement date and for which there is no active market  our principal market under asc is a hypothetical secondary market 
the determination of the principal market used to estimate the fair value of each of our investments can have a material impact on our estimate of the fair value of our investments 
the levels of fair value inputs used to measure our investments are characterized in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established by asc where inputs for an asset or liability fall into more than one level in the fair value hierarchy  the investment is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to that investment s fair value measurement 
we use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment in determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy and investments that fall into each of the levels are described below level level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
we use level inputs for investments 
table of contents in publicly traded unrestricted securities for which we do not have a controlling interest 
such investments are valued at the closing price on the measurement date 
level level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
we did not value any of our investments using level inputs as of december  level level inputs are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data 
we use level inputs for measuring the fair value of substantially all of our investments as follows for investments in portfolio companies for which we have identified the m a market as the principal market  we estimate the fair value based on the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
for minority equity securities in which the principal market is a hypothetical secondary market  we also estimate the fair value using the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
under the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology  we estimate the enterprise fair value of the portfolio company and then waterfall the enterprise value over the portfolio company s securities in order of their preference relative to one another 
to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company  we prepare an analysis consisting of traditional valuation methodologies including market  income and cost approaches 
we weight some or all of the traditional valuation methodologies based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to conclude on our estimate of the enterprise value 
the traditional valuation methodologies consist of valuation estimates based on valuations of comparable public companies  recent sales of private and public comparable companies  discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company  estimating the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company s assets  third party valuations of the portfolio company  considering offers from third parties to buy the company  estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results  as well as other factors that may impact value  such as exposure to litigation  loss of significant customers or other contingencies 
this financial and other information is generally obtained from our portfolio companies  and may represent unaudited  projected or pro forma financial information 
in using a valuation methodology based on comparable public companies or sales of private or public comparable companies  we have to use significant judgment in the application of discounts or premiums to the prices of comparable companies for factors such as size  marketability and relative performance 
in using a valuation methodology based on the discounting of forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company  we have to use significant judgment in the development of an appropriate discount rate to be applied to the forecasted cash flows 
the assumptions incorporated in the valuation methodologies used to estimate the enterprise value consists primarily of unobservable level inputs  including management assumptions based on judgment 
for example  from time to time  we may have a portfolio company that has exposure to potential or actual litigation 
in evaluating the impact on the valuation for such items  we are required to estimate the amount that a market participant would consider in estimating fair value 
these estimates are highly subjective  based on management s assessment of the potential outcome s and the related impact on the fair value of such potential outcome s 
a change in these assumptions could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
for debt and redeemable preferred equity investments in portfolio companies for which we have identified the hypothetical secondary market as the principal market  we determine the fair value based on the assumptions that a hypothetical market participant would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield valuation methodology 
in applying the market yield valuation methodology  we estimate the fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes and our own assumptions in the absence of market observable data including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar loans and securities as of the measurement date 
the assumptions used to estimate the fair value in a hypothetical secondary market are considered primarily level inputs 
we weight third party 
table of contents broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
in estimating the remaining life  we generally use an average life based on market data of the average life of similar loans 
however  if we have information available to us that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term  we would use an estimated life based on the expected repayment date 
the average life used to estimate the fair value of our loans is generally shorter than the legal maturity of the loans as our loans have historically been prepaid prior to the maturity date 
the current interest rate spreads used to estimate the fair value of our loans is based on our experience of current interest rate spreads on similar loans 
a change in the unobservable inputs and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our loans could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
we value our investments in structured products using the market yield valuation methodology 
we estimate fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes  sales of the same or similar securities and our cash flow forecasts subject to our assumptions a market participant would use regarding the investments underlying collateral including  but not limited to  assumptions of default and recovery rates  reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates 
cash flow forecasts are discounted using a market participant s market yield assumptions which are derived from multiple sources including  but not limited to  third party broker quotes  industry research reports and transactions of securities or indices with similar structure and risk characteristics 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
the cash flow forecasts and market yields used to discount the cash flows incorporate a significant amount of level inputs 
a change in our default and recovery rate assumptions in the cash flow forecasts or a change in the market yield assumptions could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
we value derivative instruments based on fair value information from both the derivative counterparty  as adjusted for nonperformance risk considerations  and third party pricing services 
we corroborate the fair value by analyzing the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using relevant market forward interest rate yield curves in effect at the end of the period as adjusted for quantitative and qualitative nonperformance risk considerations 
a change in our determination of the nonperformance risk could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value  we measure the fair value of our investment predominately based on the nav per share of the investment fund if the nav of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of asc as of our measurement date  including measurement of all or substantially all of the underlying investments of the investee in accordance with asc however  in determining the fair value of our investment  we may make adjustments to the nav per share in certain circumstances  based on our analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our shares of our investment as of the measurement date  comparisons of price to nav per share of comparable publicly traded funds and trades or sales of comparable of private and publicly traded funds  recent actual sales or redemptions of shares of the investment fund  expected future cash flows available to equity holders or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full nav of the investment fund 
as of december   we had an investment in european capital  a wholly owned investment fund that invests in and sponsors management and employee buyouts  invests in private equity buyouts and provides capital directly to private and mid sized public companies primarily in europe 
it primarily invests in senior debt  subordinated debt and equity 
in determining the fair value of our investment in european capital  we concluded that our investment should be less than the nav of european capital due to the risks associated with our ability to realize the full fair value of european capital s underlying assets for several reasons  including european capital negotiating the restructuring of its credit facilities with its lenders as 
table of contents of the measurement date  and recent comparable transactions and public comparables  which indicate fair values at a discount to nav 
the use of a discount to nav of european capital requires significant judgment and a change in the assumptions used to develop the discount could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information regarding the classification of our investment portfolio by levels  and as of december  interest and dividend income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
original issue discount oid is accreted into interest income using the effective interest method 
oid initially represents the value of detachable equity warrants obtained in conjunction with the origination or purchase of loans and loan origination fees that represent yield enhancement 
dividend income is recognized on the ex dividend date for common equity securities and on an accrual basis for preferred equity securities to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected or realized 
in determining the amount of dividend income to recognize  if any  from cash distributions on common equity securities  we will assess many factors including a portfolio company s cumulative undistributed income and operating cash flow 
cash distributions from common equity securities received in excess of such undistributed amounts are recorded first as a reduction of our investment and then as a realized gain on investment 
we stop accruing interest or dividends on our investments when it is determined that the interest or dividend is not collectible 
we assess the collectability of the interest and dividends based on many factors including the portfolio company s ability to service our loan based on current and projected cash flows as well as the current valuation of the portfolio company s current total enterprise value 
for investments with pik interest and cumulative dividends  we base income and dividend accruals on the valuation of the pik notes or securities received from the borrower or the redemption value of the security 
if the portfolio company valuation indicates a value of the pik notes or securities or redemption value that is not sufficient to cover the contractual interest or dividend  we will not accrue interest or dividend income on the notes or securities and will record an allowance for any accrued interest or dividend receivable as a reduction of interest or dividend income in the period we determine it is not collectible 
a change in the portfolio company valuation assigned by us could have an effect on our accrual of pik interest income on debt investments and dividend income of preferred stock investments 
also  a change in a portfolio company s operating performance and cash flows can impact a portfolio company s ability to service our debt and therefore could impact our interest recognition 
interest income on structured products is recognized on the effective interest method as required by emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets which is codified in fasb asc  investments other  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets asc 
under asc  at the time of purchase  we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our cost basis 
subsequent to the purchase and on a quarterly basis  these estimated cash flows are updated and a revised yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment 
to the extent the current quarterly estimated cash flows decrease from the prior quarterly estimated cash flows  the revised yield is calculated prospectively based on the amortized cost basis of the investment calculated in accordance with fasb staff position no 
fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which is codified in fasb asc  investment debt and equity securities 
in estimating these cash flows  there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
these include the amount and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate  and interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying loans and the timing of and magnitude of projected credit losses on the loans underlying the securities have to be estimated 
these 
table of contents uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income 
as a result  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
stock based compensation we account for all share based payments to employees under asc we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility  which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
our valuation assumptions used in estimating the fair value of share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions asc the following table reflects the weighted average fair value per option granted during the years ended december   and  as well as the weighted average assumptions used in determining those fair values using the black scholes pricing model 
options granted in millions fair value on grant date expected dividend yield expected volatility estimated annual forfeiture rate risk free interest rate expected life years we determine our expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model based on a combination of our historical volatility during the expected term of the option and our implied volatility based on the market prices of traded options of our stock 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
derivative financial instruments we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to primarily manage the adverse impact of interest rates changes on our cash flows by locking in the spread between our asset yield and the cost of our borrowings  and to fulfill our obligation under the terms of our asset securitizations 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments during the reporting period 
the fair value of interest rate derivative agreements is based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at the end of the period  adjusted for non performance risk based on our credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk 
we consider the impact of any collateral requirements  credit enhancements or netting arrangements in evaluating credit risk 

table of contents our derivatives are considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under asc topic we record the accrual of the periodic interest settlements of interest rate derivatives in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments and subsequently record the amount as a realized gain or loss on investments on the interest settlement date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we consider our principal market risks to be the fluctuations of interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings  our net increase in net assets from operations is affected by the spread between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
we attempt to match fund our liabilities and assets by financing floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities and fixed rate assets with fixed rate liabilities or equity 
we enter into interest rate basis swap agreements to match the interest rate basis of our assets and liabilities  thereby locking in the spread between our asset yield and the cost of our borrowings  and to fulfill our obligations under the terms of our asset securitizations 
however  our derivatives are considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under fasb asc topic as a result of our use of interest rate swaps  as of december   of our interest bearing assets provided fixed rate returns and approximately of our interest bearing assets provided floating rate returns 
adjusted for the effect of interest rate swaps  as of december   we had floating rate debt investments  excluding loans on non accrual  tied primarily to libor  with a principal balance of  million and had total borrowings outstanding of  million that have a variable rate of interest based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate 
assuming no changes to our consolidated balance sheet as of december   a hypothetical increase or decrease in libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate by basis points would increase or decrease our net assets resulting from operations by less than million over the next twelve months compared to our net decrease in net assets resulting from operations 

table of contents under our interest rate swap agreements  we generally pay a fixed rate and receive a floating interest rate based on libor 
we also have interest rate swaption agreements where  if exercised  we receive a fixed rate and pay a floating rate based on libor 
we may enter into interest rate cap agreements that would entitle us to receive an amount  if any  by which our interest payments on our variable rate debt exceeds specified interest rates 
for those investments contributed to the term securitizations  the interest swap agreements enable us to lock in the spread between the asset yield on the investments and the cost of the borrowings under the term securitizations 
one month libor decreased from as of december  to as of december  while the three month libor decreased from as of december  to as of december  a summary of our interest rate swap and swaption agreements are included in our schedule of investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risks we have a limited amount of investments in portfolio companies  including european capital  for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency  primarily the euro 
we also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
during the year ended december   the foreign currency translation adjustment recorded in our consolidated statements of operations was net unrealized appreciation of million  primarily as a result of the euro depreciating against the us dollar 
portfolio valuation our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the act and asc for a description of our accounting policy for valuation of investments  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
as of december   the fair value of of our investments were estimated using level inputs determined in good faith by our board of directors because the investments were not publicly traded on an active market
