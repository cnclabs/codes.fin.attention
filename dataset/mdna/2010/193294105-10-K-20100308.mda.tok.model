in  the company recorded a charge of million for underperforming retail stores whose fair value was below carrying value

the primary variables used in determining fair value include collateral  rating  insurance  credit risk and downgrade risk of the security 
the company s effective tax rate was a provision for the year ended december  compared to a benefit for the year ended december  the change in the company s tax rate is a result of a million valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets offset by the tax benefit from the company s net loss 
the company analyzed both positive and negative evidence in determining the potential requirement for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
the company reviewed its results over the last three years  which resulted in a cumulative loss over such period 
in accordance with income tax accounting guidance  a three year historical cumulative loss is considered significant negative evidence and difficult to overcome in the absence of compelling positive evidence

inventory from contract manufacturers in asia and central south america are purchased in united states dollars and the recent fluctuations of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations

allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and licensees to make required payments 
customers include non factored accounts  accounts collected by the company s factors with recourse and credit card receivables from third party service providers

impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets the company performs a review of its indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
fair value the company s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy  which are as follows level a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date  level a fair value that is derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  and level a fair value that is derived from inputs that are unobservable or from observable inputs based on unobservable data in an inactive market 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred taxes are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance based on income tax accounting guidance applied by management 
the company s assessment of deferred tax assets is performed quarterly and many factors are considered when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including the recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction  the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes  tax planning strategies and other relevant factors 
the actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts the company has recorded 
the company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal  state or local authorities 
these audits include questioning of the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
the company also measures tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return and records them in the financial statements 
litigation the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
stock based compensation the company records all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the company measures the cost of services received in exchange for stock options and similar awards based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes this cost in the income statement over the period during which an award recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company uses the black scholes model to assess the fair value of non qualified employee stock options and amortizes this cost over the service period 
in addition  stock compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting primarily based on historical annual forfeiture rates and by employee classification 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed on a quarterly basis and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu adds new requirements for disclosures of significant transfers into and out of levels  and of the fair value hierarchy  the reasons for the transfers and the policy for determining when transfers are recognized 
asu also adds new requirements for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross rather than net basis relating to the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of level recurring fair value measurements 
it also clarifies the level of disaggregation to require disclosures by class rather than by major category of assets and liabilities and clarifies that a description of inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements classified as level or asu is effective january  except for the requirements to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis which are effective january  the company will adopt the update on january  and has determined that it will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has marketable securities  specifically auction rate securities  that contain double a through double c rated debt obligations and a preferred share closed end fund that are substantially all insured 
all of the company s auction rate securities have failed at auction as a result of illiquidity and imbalance in order flow within the market 
a failed auction is not an indication of an increased credit risk or a reduction in the underlying collateral  however  parties wishing to sell securities could not do so 
based on current market conditions  it is not known when or if the capital markets will come back into balance to achieve successful auctions for these securities 
if these auctions continue to fail  it could result in the company holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and will limit the liquidity of these investments 
based on the company s expected operating cash flows  and other sources and uses of cash  the company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect its ability to execute its current business plan 
these assets have been classified as long term in the company s consolidated balance sheets and have been recorded at their fair value 
the company is exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in foreign currencies  although greater than of the transactions are in us dollars 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by periodically utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   the company had no forward contracts outstanding 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings that may be made under its credit facilities 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates affecting the company s credit facilities would not have had a material effect on the company s and operations 
the company sources a significant amount of product from china and is subject to foreign currency exposure 
if the yuan is allowed to float freely against other foreign currency  a two percent change in exchange rates could have a material effect on the cost of future inventory purchases to be transacted by the company
