we provide natural gas solutions for vehicle fleets primarily in the united states and canada 
in april  we opened our first cng station in lima  peru  through our joint venture  clean energy del peru 
our primary business activity is selling cng and lng vehicle fuels and providing operations and maintenance services to our customers 
we also build fueling stations and help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles and obtain local  state and federal clean air financial and tax incentives 
our customers include fleet operators in a variety of markets  such as public transit  refuse hauling  airports  taxis and regional trucking 
in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dallas clean energy  llc dce 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells renewable biomethane at the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
on october   we acquired of baf technologies  inc baf  a company that provides natural gas conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support  and research and development for natural gas vehicles 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
sources of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from selling cng and lng and providing operations and maintenance services to our customers 
the balance of our revenue is provided by designing and constructing natural gas fueling stations  financing our customers natural gas vehicle purchases  sales of pipeline quality biomethane produced by our dce joint venture and  beginning in the fourth quarter of  sales of natural gas vehicles through our wholly owned subsidiary  baf 
key operating data 
in evaluating our operating performance  our management focuses primarily on the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents delivered which we define as i the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents we sell to our customers  plus ii the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents dispensed to our customers at stations where we provide o m services but do not directly sell the cng or lng  plus iii our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents sold as cng by our joint venture in peru  plus iv our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents of biomethane produced and sold as pipeline quality natural gas by dce  our gross margin which we define as revenue minus cost of sales  and net income loss 
the following table  which you should 
table of contents read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this form k  presents our key operating data for the years ended december   and gasoline gallon equivalents delivered year ended december  in millions cng biomethane lng total operating data gross margin net loss key trends in  and according to the us energy information administration  demand for natural gas fuels in the united states increased by approximately during the period january  through december  we believe this growth in demand was attributable primarily to the rising prices of gasoline and diesel relative to cng and lng during these periods and increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets 
the number of fueling stations we served grew from at december  to at december  a increase 
included in this number are all of the cng and lng fueling stations we own  maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract 
the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents we delivered from to increased by 
the increase in gasoline gallon equivalents delivered  contributed to increased revenues during these periods 
our cost of sales also increased during these periods  which was attributable primarily to increased costs related to delivering more cng and lng to our customers and the increased price of natural gas 
during  we also experienced reduced margins in certain markets  particularly in the municipal transit and refuse sector 
the reduction in margins is primarily a result of increased competition and sales agreements with larger entities that have greater pricing leverage 
in addition  during  we acquired four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts with municipal transit agencies that have significant volume but smaller margins than we typically maintain on our fuel sales 
as a result  the overall average margin on our fuel sales across our business decreased during we believe that our margins on fuel sales will improve in the future to the extent we are successful in growing our retail cng and lng fueling operations  which is where we earn our highest margin  relative to our lower margin operations  such as municipal transit 
during  prices for oil  gasoline  diesel fuel and natural gas generally increased 
oil increased from a low of per barrel on january  to a price of per barrel on december  in california  average retail prices for gasoline have increased from a low of per gallon in january to per gallon at december   and average retail prices for diesel fuel have increased from a low of per diesel gallon in march to per diesel gallon at december  to the extent that we continue to try to price lng and cng at a discount to diesel and gasoline prices in an effort to attract new and retain existing customers  our revenue and profit margin on fuel sales may be lower than they were during when gasoline and diesel were at substantially higher prices 
in addition  the volatility in natural gas prices has a direct impact on our revenue 
the nymex price for natural gas increased from a low of per mmbtu in september to per mmbtu at december  the average retail sales price of our cng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area increased from for the month of january to for the month of december 
table of contents recent developments 
on october   we purchased all the outstanding shares of baf technologies  inc baf under a stock purchase agreement 
we paid an upfront purchase price of million to acquire baf 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the purchase price was reduced by the amount of baf s outstanding debt which was repaid in full at closing 
due to the fact that we held approximately million of baf s outstanding debt  including interest  we paid a net amount of approximately million in cash to acquire baf at the closing 
baf shareholders will be able to earn additional consideration if baf achieves certain gross profit targets in fiscal and the additional consideration will be determined as a percentage of gross profit based on a sliding scale that increases at certain gross profit levels  subject to achieving a minimum gross profit target and capped by a maximum additional payment amount 
for  the shareholders of baf will receive between one and twenty six percent of gross profit of baf as additional consideration if baf achieves million or more in gross profit  up to a maximum of million in additional consideration which would be payable if baf achieved approximately million in gross profit in 
for  the shareholders of baf will receive between one and twenty one percent of gross profit of baf as additional consideration if baf achieves million or more in gross profit  up to a maximum of million in additional consideration which would be payable if baf achieved approximately million in gross profit in 
the contingent consideration was valued at million on the acquisition date  and based on the accounting literature for business combinations that became effective for new acquisitions for the company on january   the company will adjust this liability each reporting period  with a corresponding gain or loss reflected in the statement of operations  based on changes in the fair value of the obligation 
founded in  baf provides natural gas vehicle conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development for natural gas vehicles ngv 
baf s vehicle conversions include taxis  limousines  vans  pick up trucks and shuttle buses 
baf has certified ngvs under both epa and california air resources board carb standards achieving super ultra low emission vehicle emissions 
following at t s announcement in march of their intent to deploy more than  alternative fuel vehicles over the next five years  approximately  of which are expected to be ngvs  baf was awarded a purchase order to provide to at t the initial ford e series converted cng vans in and has subsequently received purchase orders for  cng vans for the first three quarters of anticipated future trends 
despite the recent volatility in energy prices  we anticipate that  over the long term  the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel  and more stringent emissions requirements will continue to make natural gas vehicles an attractive alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel powered vehicles 
our belief that natural gas will continue  over the long term  to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in part on the growth in us natural gas production 
a navigant consulting  inc study indicates that as a result of new unconventional gas shale discoveries from basins in the us  maximum estimates of total recoverable domestic reserves from producers have increased to equal years of us production at producing rates 
the study indicated a mean level of reserves equal to years of supply at production levels 
according to the report  shale gas production growth from only the major six shale plays in the us  plus the marcellus shale  could become billion cubic feet per day and as high as billion cubic feet per day by navigant has also indicated that development of the shale resources base has resulted in a substantial current surplus of gas supply compared to demand of as much as billion cubic feet per day 
these current surplus levels are of annual average historical us consumption levels of approximately tcf per year  providing sufficient gas supply to meet the requirements of all existing markets and to meet new market requirements 
based on analyst reports  we believe that there is a significant worldwide supply of natural gas relative to crude oil as well 
according to the bp statistical review of world energy  on a global basis  the ratio of proven natural gas reserves to natural gas production was greater than the ratio of 
table of contents proven crude oil reserves to crude oil production 
this analysis suggests significantly greater longer term availability of natural gas than crude oil based on current consumption 
we believe there will be significant growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets  and our goal is to capitalize on this trend and enhance our leadership position as this market expands 
we have built natural gas fueling stations  and plan to build additional natural gas fueling stations  that will provide lng to fleet vehicles at the ports of los angeles and long beach 
we also anticipate expanding our sales of cng and lng in the other markets in which we operate  including public transit  regional trucking  refuse hauling and airports 
consistent with the anticipated growth of our business  we also expect that our operating costs and capital expenditures will increase  primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network as well as the logistics of delivering more cng and lng to our customers 
additionally  we have and will continue to increase our sales and marketing team and other necessary personnel as we seek to expand our existing markets and enter new markets  which will also result in increased costs 
the disruption in the capital markets that began during and has continued into has made it more difficult for new customers to finance or invest in natural gas vehicle acquisitions or natural gas fueling stations 
continuing economic contraction and reduced economic activity may reduce our opportunities to attract new fleet customers 
many governmental entities  which during through represented approximately of our revenues  are experiencing significant budget deficits as a result of the economic recession and have been and may continue to be unable to invest in new natural gas vehicles for their transit or refuse fleets or may be compelled to reduce public transportation and services  which would negatively affect our business 
sources of liquidity and anticipated capital expenditures 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows  the sale or maturity of existing assets  or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management 
historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
our current business plan  assuming that the nat gas act or comparable legislation is passed into law  calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations 
we will have to raise capital to fund this business plan if the nat gas act or similar legislation is passed into law providing incentives for the use of natural gas fuel and purchase of natural gas vehicles that lead to rapid growth in our business 
if the nat gas act or similar legislation is not passed or any available incentives do not lead to rapid growth in our business  we anticipate that we will build fewer fueling stations and our capital expenditures may be materially less than million 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in expansion of our california lng plant  expansion of our dce landfill gas processing plant  or for other acquisitions or investments in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund expansion of our california lng plant or dce landfill gas plant  acquisitions or other capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash  our line of credit from plainscapital bank  or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend primarily on our rate of new station construction  which will be affected by any federal legislation that may provide incentives for natural gas vehicle purchases and fuel use  any decision to expand our california lng plant or dce gas processing plant and potential merger or acquisition activity 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources below 
due to the continuing disruption in the capital markets  we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  expand our california lng plant or dce gas processing plant  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and reduce our ability to grow our business and generate increased revenues 

table of contents business risks and uncertainties 
our business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties 
for more information  see risk factors in part i  item a 
operations we generate revenues principally by selling cng and lng and providing operations and maintenance services to our vehicle fleet customers 
for the year ended december   cng and biomethane together represented and lng represented of our natural gas sales on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenues by designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing those stations to our customers 
we also generate material revenues through sales of biomethane produced by our joint venture subsidiary dce  and beginning in the fourth quarter of  sales of natural gas vehicles by our wholly owned subsidiary baf 
substantially all of our operating and maintenance revenues are generated from cng stations  as owners of lng stations tend to operate and maintain their own stations 
substantially all of our station sale and leasing revenues have been generated from cng stations 
cng sales we sell cng through fueling stations located on our customers properties and through our network of public access fueling stations 
at these cng fueling stations  we procure natural gas from local utilities or brokers under standard  floating rate arrangements and then compress and dispense it into our customers vehicles 
our cng sales are made primarily through contracts with our fleet customers 
under these contracts  pricing is determined primarily on an index plus basis  which is calculated by adding a margin to the local index or utility price for natural gas 
cng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we sell a small amount of cng under fixed price contracts and also provide price caps to certain customers on their index plus pricing arrangements 
effective january   we ceased offering price cap contracts to our customers  but we will continue to perform our obligations under price cap contracts we entered into before january  we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy that was revised in may our fleet customers typically are billed monthly based on the volume of cng sold at a station 
the remainder of our cng sales are on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
in april  we opened our first cng station in lima  peru through our joint venture clean energy del peru 
lng sales we sell substantially all of our lng to fleet customers  who typically own and operate their fueling stations 
we also sell lng to customers at our two public lng stations and for non vehicle use 
we procure lng from third party producers and also produce lng at our liquefaction plants in texas and california 
for lng that we purchase from third parties  we may enter into take or pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based rates 
we deliver lng via our fleet of tanker trailers to fueling stations  where it is stored and dispensed in liquid form into vehicles 
we sell lng principally through supply contracts that are priced on either a fixed price or index plus basis 
lng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we also provided price caps to certain customers on the index component of their index plus pricing arrangement for certain contracts we entered into on or prior to december  effective january   we ceased offering price cap contracts to our customers  but we will continue to perform our obligations under price cap contracts we entered into before january   including a one year renewal period beginning april  that one of our customers is entitled to exercise 
this renewal period  if exercised  would obligate us to sell the customer approximately million lng gallons subject to a price cap of per mmbtu on 
table of contents the southern california gas company index 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy that was revised in may our lng contracts provide that we charge our customers periodically based on the volume of lng supplied 
government incentives from october  through december   we received a federal fuel tax credit vetc of per gasoline gallon equivalent of cng and per liquid gallon of lng that we sold as vehicle fuel 
based on the service relationship with our customers  either we or our customers were able to claim the credit 
we recorded these tax credits as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the credits are fully refundable and do not need to offset tax liabilities to be received 
as such  the credits are not deemed income tax credits under the accounting guidance applicable to income taxes 
in addition  we believe the credits are properly recorded as revenue because we often incorporate the tax credits into our pricing with our customers  thereby lowering the actual price per gallon we charge them 
the tax credit expired on december  if the tax credit is not reinstated or extended  our revenue in future periods will be materially reduced and our ability to attract new customers  or retain old customers  may also be reduced 
operation and maintenance we generate a portion of our revenue from operation and maintenance agreements for cng fueling stations where we do not supply the fuel 
we refer to this portion of our business as o m 
at these fueling stations  the customer contracts directly with a local broker or utility to purchase natural gas 
for o m services  we do not sell the fuel itself  but generally charge a per gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station 
we include the volume of fuel dispensed at the stations at which we provide o m services in our calculation of aggregate gallon equivalents sold 
station construction we generate a small portion of our revenue from designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing the stations to our customers 
for these projects  we act as general contractor or supervise qualified third party contractors 
we charge construction fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project 
vehicle acquisition and finance in  we commenced offering vehicle finance services for some of our customers purchases of natural gas vehicles or the conversion of their existing gasoline or diesel powered vehicles to operate on natural gas 
we loan to certain qualifying customers on average  and on occasion up to  of the purchase price of their natural gas vehicles 
we may also lease vehicles in the future 
where appropriate  we apply for and receive state and federal incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers 
we may also secure vehicles to place with customers or pay deposits with respect to such vehicles prior to receiving a firm order from our customers  which we may be required to purchase if our customer fails to purchase the vehicle as anticipated 
through december   we have not generated significant revenue from vehicle finance activities 
landfill gas in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dce for a purchase price of million including transaction costs 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells biomethane from the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
from the acquisition date through december   and for the year ended december   dce generated approximately 
table of contents million and million  respectively  in revenue from sales of biomethane  all of which is included in our consolidated statements of operations 
on april   dce entered into a fifteen year gas sale agreement with shell energy north america us  lp shell for the sale by dce to shell of biomethane produced by dce s landfill gas processing facility 
dce retains the right to reserve from the gas sale agreement up to mmbtus per day of biomethane for sale as a vehicle fuel 
to the extent that dce produces volumes of biomethane in excess of the volumes sold under the agreement with shell  dce will either attempt to sell such volumes at then prevailing market prices or seek to enter into another gas sale agreement in the future 
there is no guarantee that dce will produce or be able to sell up to the maximum volumes called for under the agreement  and dce s ability to produce such volumes of biomethane is dependent on a number of factors beyond dce s control including  but not limited to  the availability and composition of the landfill gas that is collected  the impact on dce s operations of the operation of the landfill by the city of dallas and the reliability of the processing plant s critical equipment 
the sale price for the gas under the agreement with shell is fixed and increases in and the sale price for the gas represents a substantial premium to the current prevailing prices for natural gas at march  under the terms of the agreement  dce has retained the rights to any available greenhouse gas emission reduction credits that may be generated through the operation of the landfill gas collection and processing facility  provided that dce must supply shell with a sufficient number of such credits to enable the end user of the gas to meet applicable net zero emissions requirements under the relevant renewable portfolio standard with respect to use of the biomethane in power generation 
dce is in the preliminary stages of assessing whether greenhouse gas emission reduction credits will be generated or available for sale as a result of the landfill gas collection and pipeline quality biomethane production 
given the complex and changing standards and requirements in the market for greenhouse gas emission reduction credits  there can be no guarantee that any greenhouse gas emission credits will be generated or available for sale as a result of dce s landfill gas operations 
the gas sale agreement is terminable by either party on days written notice if the california energy commission makes a written determination or adopts a ruling or regulation after the date of the agreement that the biomethane sold under the agreement will  from the date of such ruling or regulation  no longer qualify as a california renewable portfolio standard eligible fuel 
in addition  shell has the right to terminate the agreement upon days written notice if the volumes of biomethane produced and delivered  calculated monthly on a rolling two year average  are less than an annual average of  mmbtu per year or  mmbtu per day 
vehicle conversion on september   we agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of baf technologies  inc founded in  baf provides natural gas vehicle conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development 
baf s vehicle conversions include taxis  limousines  vans  pick up trucks and shuttle buses 
baf utilizes advanced natural gas system integration technology and has certified ngvs under both epa and carb standards achieving super ultra low emission vehicle emissions 
we generate revenues through the sale of natural gas vehicles that have been converted to run on natural gas by baf 
the majority of baf s revenue during was derived from sales of converted natural gas service vans to at t 
baf contributed approximately million to our revenue during 
table of contents volatility of earnings and cash flows our earnings and cash flows historically have fluctuated significantly from period to period based on our futures activities  as all but a few of our futures contracts have not historically qualified for hedge accounting under the relative derivative accounting guidance 
we have therefore recorded any changes in the fair market value of these contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting directly in our statements of operations in the line item derivative gains losses along with any realized gains or losses generated during the period 
for example  we experienced derivative gains of million for the three months ended june   and derivative losses of million and million for the three months ended september  and december   respectively 
we had no derivative gains or losses for the three months ended march   june   september   december   march   march   june   september  and december  related to our futures contracts 
in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy  we plan to structure all subsequent futures contracts as cash flow hedges under the applicable derivative accounting guidance  but we cannot be certain that they will qualify 
see risk management activities below 
if the futures contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we could incur significant increases or decreases in our earnings based on fluctuations in the market value of the contracts from period to period 
additionally  we are required to maintain a margin account to cover losses related to our natural gas futures contracts 
futures contracts are valued daily  and if our contracts are in loss positions at the end of a trading day  our broker will transfer the amount of the losses from our margin account to a clearinghouse 
if at any time the funds in our margin account drop below a specified maintenance level  our broker will issue a margin call that requires us to restore the balance 
consequently  these payments could significantly impact our cash balances 
at december   we had million on deposit in margin accounts 
the decrease in the value of our futures positions and any required margin deposits on our futures contracts that are in a loss position could significantly impact our financial condition in the future 
volatility of earnings related to series i warrants beginning january   under new accounting guidance  we are required to record the change in the fair market value of our series i warrants in our financial statements 
we recognized a loss gain of million  million  million and million related to recording the fair market value changes of our series i warrants in the quarters ended march   june   september  and december   respectively see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially impacted by future gains or losses we are required to take as a result of valuing our series i warrants 
debt compliance our credit agreement with plainscapital bank pcb credit agreement requires us to comply with certain covenants 
we may not incur indebtedness or liens except as permitted by the credit agreement  or declare or pay dividends 
we must maintain  on a quarterly basis  minimum liquidity of not less than million  accounts receivable balances  as defined  of not less than million  consolidated net worth  as defined  of not less than million  and a debt to equity ratio  as defined  of not more than to beginning in the quarter ended june   we must also maintain a specific minimum debt service ratio at each quarter end 
effective in the fourth quarter of  we established a lock box arrangement with pcb subject to the credit agreement 
funds received from our customers are remitted to the lock box and then deposited to a pcb bank account 
the remitted funds are not used to pay down the balance of the credit agreement 
one of the events of default is the occurrence of a material adverse change  which is a subjective acceleration clause 

table of contents based on the relevant accounting guidance  we have classified our debt pursuant to the credit agreement as short term or long term  as appropriate  and we believe an event of default is more than remote but not more likely than not 
if we default on the credit agreement  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become immediately due and payable and all funds received in our lockbox held by pcb  plus million we have deposited with pcb in a payment reserve account  will be applied to the balance due on the credit agreement 
one of our bank covenants is a requirement to maintain accounts receivable balances from certain subsidiaries above million at each quarter end 
to the extent natural gas prices continue to fall  which a significant portion of our revenues are derived from  or our volumes decline  we could violate this covenant in the future 
beginning with the quarter ended june   we are required to maintain a specific minimum debt service ratio 
to the extent our operating results do not materialize as planned  we could violate this covenant in the future 
in the event we violate either of these covenants  we would seek a waiver from the bank 
we were in compliance with all of our covenants at december  risk management activities historically  a significant portion of our natural gas fuel sales have been covered by contracts to sell lng or cng to our customers at a fixed price or a variable index based price subject to a cap 
these contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell gas to our customers 
we account for sales of natural gas under these contracts as described below in critical accounting policies fixed price and price cap sales contracts 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to our futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to fixed price sales contracts  our board of directors revisited our risk management policies and procedures and adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy in february  which was amended effective may   and restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the board of directors and the derivative committee  we will conduct our futures activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with the natural gas hedging policy  a complete copy of which was filed as exhibit to our form k filed with the sec on june  pursuant to the policy  we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid 
subject to the conditions set forth in the policy  we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to hedge effectively our exposure to cash flow variability related to such fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy 
the summary of the policy described above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the policy previously filed 
due to the restrictions of our revised hedging policy  we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
if we do offer a fixed price sales contract  we anticipate including a price component that would cover our increased costs as well as a return on our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts 
the amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contracts 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable 
table of contents reserves  notes receivable reserves  derivative values  income taxes  and the market value of equity instruments granted as stock based compensation 
we use historical experience  market quotes  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our gas sales and for our o m services in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
applying these factors  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas at the time fuel is dispensed or  in the case of lng sales agreements  delivered to the customer s storage facility 
we recognize revenue from operation and maintenance agreements as we provide the o m services 
in certain transactions with our customers  we agree to provide multiple products or services  including construction of and either leasing or sale of a station  providing operations and maintenance to the station  and sale of fuel to the customer 
we evaluate the separability of revenues for deliverables based on current accounting guidance  which provides a framework for establishing whether or not a particular arrangement with a customer has one or more deliverables 
to the extent we have adequate objective evidence of the values of separate deliverable items under a contract  we allocate the revenue from the contract on a relative fair value basis at the inception of the arrangement 
during  and  we did not have objective evidence for our multi deliverable contracts  which generally resulted in the deferral of revenue until future services are performed 
if the arrangement contains a lease  we use the existing evidence of fair value to separate the lease from the other deliverables 
we account for our leasing activities in accordance with current accounting guidance 
our existing station leases are sales type leases  giving rise to profit at the delivery of the leased station 
unearned revenue is amortized into income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
for those arrangements  we recognize gas sales and operations and maintenance service revenues as earned from the customer on a volume delivered basis 
we recognize revenue on fueling station construction projects where we sell the station to the customer using the completed contract method 
we recognize revenue on biomethane sales and vehicle sales when we transfer title of the gas or vehicle to our customer 
natural gas derivative activities current accounting guidance for our derivative instruments  specifically our natural gas futures contracts  require the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value to the extent they qualify for hedge accounting 
our derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting for the years ended december   and we did not have any derivative activities in during  we had some futures contracts that qualified for hedge accounting and some that did not 
during  we had five contracts that did qualify for hedge accounting 
as such  changes in the fair value of the derivatives were recorded directly to our consolidated statements of operations for the futures contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting during these periods 
we determine the fair value of our derivatives at the end of each reporting period based on quoted market prices from the nymex discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts related to future periods 

table of contents the counter party to the company s derivative transactions is a high credit quality counterparty  however  the company is subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty to the derivatives is unable to meet its settlement commitments 
the company manages this credit risk by minimizing the number and size of its derivative contracts 
the company actively monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and records valuation adjustments against the derivative assets to reflect counterparty risk  if necessary 
the counter party is also exposed to credit risk of the company  which requires the company to provide cash deposits as collateral 
the company marks to market its open futures positions at the end of each period and records the net unrealized gain or loss during the period in derivative gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations or in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance 
the company recorded unrealized gains of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year ended december  related to its futures contracts 
the fair value of the company s futures contracts of approximately  at december   of which an asset of  is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the short term amount  and  is included as a liability in other long term liabilities for the long term amount on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  the company s ineffectiveness related to its futures contracts in the year ended december  was insignificant 
in  the company recognized cost of sales of million in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to its futures contracts that were settled during year 
the following table presents the notional amounts and weighted average fixed prices per gasoline gallon equivalent of the company s natural gas futures contracts as of december  gallons weighted average price per gasoline gallon equivalent january to may  fixed price and price cap sales contracts without an underlying futures contract from time to time  the company enters into contracts with various customers  primarily municipalities  to sell lng or cng at fixed prices  and prior to january   the company also from time to time entered into contracts to sell lng or cng at prices subject to a price cap 
effective january   the company no longer offers contracts with a price cap to its customers 
the contracts generally range from two to five years 
the most significant cost component of lng and cng is the price of natural gas 
through june  we also may or may not have had a futures contract in place to economically offset the price of natural gas we were selling to our customers on a fixed priced basis 
for any futures contracts that were in place related to these contracts  they did not qualify for hedge accounting and they may have been sold and subsequently reestablished over the term of the customer contract 
as part of determining the fixed price or price cap in the contracts  the company works with its customers to determine their future usage over the contract term 
the company s fixed price and price cap customers  however  do not agree to purchase a minimum amount of volume or guarantee their volume of purchases 
there is not an explicit volume in the contract as the company agrees to sell its customers volumes on an as needed basis  also known as a requirements contract 
the volume required under these contracts varies each month  and is not subject to any minimum commitments 

table of contents for us generally accepted accounting purposes  there is not a notional amount  which is one of the required conditions for a transaction to be a derivative pursuant to the authoritative guidance 
the company s sales agreements that fix the price or cap the price of lng or cng that it sells to its customers are  for accounting purposes  firm commitments  and us generally accepted accounting principles do not require or allow the company to record a loss until the delivery of the gas and corresponding sale of the product occurs 
when the company enters into these fixed price or price cap contracts with its customers  the price is set based on the prevailing index price of natural gas at that time 
the index price of natural gas  however  constantly changes  and a difference between the fixed price of the natural gas included in the customer s contract price and the corresponding index price of natural gas typically occurs after the company enters into the sales contract with the price of natural gas having historically increased 
prior to june  from an accounting perspective  during periods of rising natural gas prices  the company s futures contracts related to these transactions have generally been marked to market through the recognition of a derivative asset and a corresponding derivative gain in its statements of operations 
however  because the company s contracts to sell lng or cng to its customers at fixed prices or an index based price that is subject to a fixed price cap are not derivatives for purposes of us generally accepted accounting principles  a liability or a corresponding loss has not been recognized in the company s statements of operations during these periods of rising natural gas prices for the future commitments under these contracts 
as a result  for these situations  the company s statements of operations do not reflect its firm commitments to deliver lng or cng at prices that are below  and in some cases  substantially below  the prevailing market price of natural gas and therefore lng or cng 
income taxes we compute income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets when management determines it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
when evaluating the need for a valuation analysis  we use estimates involving a high degree of judgment including projected future income and the amounts and estimated timing of the reversal of any deferred tax liabilities 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its share based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognizes the expense in the statements of operations 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our options  which requires that we make assumptions concerning the market price of our stock  our stock price volatility  our projected dividends  and the risk free inherent rate applicable to the relevant period 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indicator of impairment based on current accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
an initial assessment of impairment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill  which in our case is the us operations and baf  to the book value of these operations 
when assessing fair value  we look at our projected future cash flows and our market capitalization for the respective operations 
to the extent our projected future cash flows do not materialized as planned or 
table of contents our market capitalization goes down  which could occur during the current economic contraction  we may be forced to take an impairment charge in future periods 
our goodwill balance at december  was million 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an impairment is indicated and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second test  we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill  we will record an impairment charge 
we performed our annual tests of goodwill as of december   and and there was no impairment indicated 
the company has two reporting units with goodwill  baf and its us operations 
baf was acquired on october   so the fair market value of its goodwill of approximately million approximates its book value as of december  the remaining goodwill is associated with the company s us operations  and the fair value of the company s us operations greatly exceeds its book value 
management would not expect there to be any impairment of its goodwill at its us operations in the foreseeable future unless there is a dramatic decrease in the price of the company s common stock or a very significant adverse event that severely impacted the company s us business

results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a portion of this increase was the result of an increase in the number of gallons delivered from million gasoline gallon equivalents to million gasoline gallon equivalents 
revenue also increased by million from sales of natural gas conversion equipment and vehicles by baf  which we acquired on october   and million in increased station construction revenue between periods 
the increase in volume was primarily from an increase in cng sales of million gallons and an increase in biomethane sales our share of the biomethane sales of dce of million gallons 
the acquisition of four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts in may and june  eight new refuse customers  and one new transit customer together accounted for million gallons of the cng volume increase 
the volume growth from our joint venture in peru and from existing refuse and transit customers contributed to the remaining cng volume increase 
we believe that the biomethane sales increase was primarily attributable to our investment in new wells and the capital upgrades to the processing plant that we completed in the first quarter of we also experienced an increase of million gallons in lng volume between periods  which was primarily due to the volume growth from our port trucking customers 
these increases were offset by the decrease in our effective price per gallon charged between periods 
our effective price per gallon was in the year ended december   which represents a per gallon decrease from in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the decreased price of natural gas in  upon which a significant portion of our revenues are based 
in the majority of our contracts  natural gas commodity prices are a direct pass through to our customer or the customer pays for the natural gas commodity themselves 
revenue attributable to vetc also decreased between periods as we recorded million of revenue related to fuel tax credits in  compared to million in due to the fact that a few of our customers began collecting the credit that we had previously collected

these decreases were offset by million increase in stock option expense between periods  primarily due to the expensing of options granted to our employees in december and january  and an increase of million in bonus expense between periods due to higher anticipated payouts in there was also an increase of million in salaries and benefits between periods primarily related to the hiring of additional employees 
our employee headcount increased from at december  to at december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation expense in the year ended december  related to increased property and equipment balances between periods  including our expanded station network and our california lng plant 
our december  amortization amount also includes amortization of the city of dallas landfill gas lease that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of dce on august  and amortization of the intangible assets we obtained in connection with our acquisition of the operation and maintenance contracts we acquired during the second quarter of and baf in the fourth quarter of interest income expense  net

the non controlling interest represents the interest of our joint venture partner 
the results of dce s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since august   the date of acquisition 
seasonality and inflation to some extent  we experience seasonality in our results of operations 
natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tends to be higher in summer months when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems 
natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods 
since our inception  inflation has not significantly affected our operating results 
however  costs for construction  repairs  maintenance  electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately  build new stations  build new lng plants and expand our existing facilities or materially increase our operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
on august   in connection with our acquisition of of the membership interests of dce  we entered into a credit agreement with pcb pursuant to which we borrowed million under a term loan and an additional million under a line of credit see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on september   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to boone pickens interests  ltd 
for proceeds of approximately million 
on november   we sold  units of common stock and warrants for per unit and we raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs 
on july   we sold  shares of our common stock to third party investors and received net proceeds of million 
on october   we repaid the million term loan with pcb and simultaneously amended the credit agreement to obtain a million line of credit loc 
the loc expires august   but we have a one year renewal option we can exercise as long as we are not in default on the pcb debt facilities 
as of december   we have not drawn 
table of contents any loan amounts under the new loc and we have an outstanding balance of million on our original line of credit 
in addition to funding operations  our principal uses of cash have been  and are expected to be  the construction of new fueling stations  construction of lng production facilities  the purchase of new lng tanker trailers  investment in biomethane production  the financing of natural gas vehicles for our customers and general corporate purposes  including making deposits to support our derivative activities  geographic expansion domestically and internationally  expanding our sales and marketing activities  support of legislative initiatives and for working capital for our expansion 
we have also acquired and may continue to seek to acquire and invest in companies or assets in the natural gas and biomethane fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
we financed our operations in primarily through cash on hand and cash provided by operations 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from improved operating results between periods of million  of which million is attributable to not incurring expenditures to support proposition that were incurred in this increase was offset by a decrease of million of deposits on lng trucks and a decrease of million in collections of accounts and other receivables between periods 
the remaining changes primarily resulted from changes in working capital balances  which were mostly due to timing differences related to the various cash flows between periods 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  our purchases of property and equipment were million during  compared to million which included expenditures for our california lng plant in our cash used in acquisitions  net of cash acquired  was million during  compared to million in we acquired four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts for million during the second quarter of and in the fourth quarter of we purchased baf technologies  inc for total net cash consideration after repayment of debt of million

we made investments during and totaling million and million  respectively  in the vehicle production group  llc  a company developing a cng taxi and a paratransit vehicle 
in june and july  we sold certain customer vehicle loans to a bank for net proceeds of million 
in  we purchased million of short term investments with our initial public offering proceeds  of which million matured or were sold during the period 
we did not have any short term investments during cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  our cash proceeds from the issuance of equity instruments was million during  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the  shares of our common stock we sold to third party investors during the third quarter of  through which we received net proceeds of million 
our debt proceeds received were million during  compared to million in in  we borrowed million to fund the acquisition of our interest in dce and to fund other amounts and improvements related to the transaction 
during  we incurred additional borrowings of million to fund further improvements by dce as we lent the majority of the proceeds we received from pcb to dce 
our repayments of capital lease obligations and long term debt were million during  compared to million in in october  we repaid in full the facility a loan 
table of contents with pcb which had approximately million outstanding at that time 
in addition  we made scheduled principal payments of million during the year 
our financial position and liquidity are  and will be  influenced by a variety of factors  including our ability to generate cash flows from operations  deposits and margin calls on our futures positions  the level of any outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness  our capital expenditure requirements which consist primarily of station construction  lng plant construction costs  dce plant construction costs and the purchase of lng tanker trailers and equipment and any merger or acquisition activity 
capital expenditures our current business plan  assuming passage of the nat gas act or comparable legislation providing incentives for natural gas vehicle purchases or fuel use  calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations 
we will have to raise capital to fund this business plan if the nat gas act or similar legislation is passed into law providing incentives for natural gas fuel use and purchase of natural gas vehicles that leads to rapid growth in our business 
if the nat gas act or similar legislation is not passed  or the incentives do not lead to rapid growth in our business  we anticipate that we will build fewer fueling stations and our capital expenditures may be materially less than million 
notwithstanding the outcome of any federal legislation that may lead to growth in our business  if we have significant unanticipated capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions or operating expenses  we may also seek to raise capital to fund such capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions or expenses 
due to the continuing disruption in the capital markets  we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure  invest in our biomethane business  invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and reduce our ability to generate increased revenues 
our credit agreement with pcb requires that we comply with certain covenants  as detailed in footnote of our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
one of the covenants requires that we maintain accounts receivable balances from certain subsidiaries above million at each quarter end during the term 
to the extent natural gas prices fall  which would result in decreased revenues  or our volumes sold decline  we could violate this covenant 
also  beginning with the quarter ending june   we are required to maintain a debt service ratio  as defined  of to should our operating results not materialize as planned  we could violate this covenant 
if we were to violate a covenant  we would seek a waiver from the bank  which the bank is not obligated to grant 
if the bank does not grant a waiver  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become immediately due and payable and million of our funds held by pcb would be applied to the balance due on the pcb loans 
we also would be unable to use the million pcb line of credit if this were to occur 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december

off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on our financial condition 
outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling million  two take or pay contracts for the purchase of lng  operating leases where we are the lessee  operating leases where we are the lessor and owner of the equipment  and firm commitments to sell cng and lng at fixed prices 
we provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of business  as a form of guarantee 
no liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds as we do not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed 
we have entered into a contract  which expires in june  with one vendor to purchase lng that requires us to purchase minimum volumes 
the minimum commitment under the contract is included in the table set forth under take or pay lng purchase contracts above 
in october  
table of contents we entered into a contingent take or pay contract from an lng plant that is also included in the table above as it is anticipated to begin in march when the plant commences operations 
we have entered into operating lease arrangements for certain equipment and for our office and field operating locations in the ordinary course of business 
the terms of our leases expire at various dates through additionally  in november  we entered into a ground lease for acres in california on which we built our california lng liquefaction plant 
the lease is for an initial term of thirty years and requires payments of  per year  plus up to  per year for each million gallons of production capacity utilized  subject to future adjustment based on consumer price index changes 
we must also pay a royalty to the landlord for each gallon of lng produced at the facility  as well as a fee for certain other services that the landlord will provide 
commercial operations began december   and the fixed payments for this lease are included in operating lease commitments in the contractual obligations table set forth above 
we are also the lessor in various leases with our customers  whereby our customers lease from us certain stations and equipment that we own 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are subject to market risk with respect to our sales of natural gas  which has historically been subject to volatile market conditions 
our exposure to market risk is heightened when we have a fixed price or price cap sales contract with a customer that is not covered by a futures contract  or when we are otherwise unable to pass through natural gas price increases to customers 
natural gas prices and availability are affected by many factors  including weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
natural gas costs represented of our cost of sales for and or excluding baf of our cost of sales for prices for natural gas over the nine year period from december  through december   based on the nymex daily futures data  have ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
at december   the nymex index price of natural gas was per mcf 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in natural gas  we may enter into exchange traded natural gas futures contracts 
these arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the other party to the contract defaults on its contract or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual price of natural gas we pay at the delivery point 
we account for these futures contracts in accordance with the accounting guidance on derivatives 
the accounting under this guidance for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether it has been specified in a hedging relationship and  further  on the type of hedging relationship 
to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship  specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained 
our futures contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting under this guidance for the years ended december  and  and we did not have any derivative activity in consequently  any changes in the fair value of the derivatives during and were recorded directly to our consolidated statements of operations 
in  we had certain contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting and we had two derivative contracts to hedge two fixed supply contracts that did qualify for hedge accounting 
during the year ended december   we had five futures contracts that did qualify for hedge accounting 
the fair value of the futures contracts we use is based on quoted prices in active exchange traded or over the counter markets which are then discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts applicable to future periods 
the fair value of these futures contracts is continually subject to change due to market conditions 
we did not have any futures contracts outstanding during the year ended 
table of contents december  in an effort to mitigate the volatility in our earnings related to futures activities  in february  our board of directors adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy which restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
this policy was further revised by our board of directors in may we plan to structure prospective futures contracts so that they will be accounted for as cash flow hedges under this guidance  but we cannot be certain they will qualify 
for more information  please read risk management activities above 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to the futures contracts we hold as of december  to hedge the fixed price component of certain supply contracts 
if the price of natural gas were to fluctuate increase or decrease by from the price quoted on nymex on december  per mcf  we could expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the contracts of approximately million
