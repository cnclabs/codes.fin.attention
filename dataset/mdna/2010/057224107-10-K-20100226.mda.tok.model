item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 
international operations we operate in over countries around the world 
we have manufacturing operations internationally in various countries including  but not limited  to the united kingdom  germany  venezuela  argentina  and the uae 
the business operations of our two segments are organized around nine primary geographic regions 
in the western hemisphere there are four regions us land  gulf of mexico  canada and latin america 
in the eastern hemisphere there are five regions europe  africa  russia caspian  middle east  and asia pacific 
through this structure  we have placed our management close to our customers  facilitating stronger customer relationships and allowing us to react more quickly to local market conditions and needs 
our operations are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in multiple countries with various laws and differing political environments 
these risks include the risks identified in item a 
risk factors 
although it is impossible to predict the likelihood of such occurrences or their effect on us  we routinely evaluate these risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks where possible 
however  there can be no assurance that an occurrence of any one or more of these events would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
further information is set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development  patents we are engaged in research and development activities directed primarily toward the improvement of existing products and services  the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs and the development of new products  processes and services 
for information regarding the amounts of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended december   see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein 
we have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions through out the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance 
we believe our patents and trademarks to be adequate for the conduct of our business  and aggressively pursue protection of our patents against patent infringement worldwide 
no single patent or trademark is considered to be critical to our business 
seasonality our operations can be affected by seasonal weather  which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services  as well as customers budgetary cycles for capital expenditures 
the widespread geographic locations of our operations and the timing of seasonal events serve to reduce the impact of individual events 
examples of seasonal events which can impact our business include the severity and duration of the winter in north america can have a significant impact on gas storage levels and drilling activity for natural gas  the timing and duration of the spring thaw in canada directly affects activity levels due to road restrictions  hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore drilling and production operations  
table of contents severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the north sea and russia  and large export orders which tend to be sold in the second half of a calendar year 
raw materials we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal materials we purchase are steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  lead  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
these materials are generally available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility 
we have not experienced significant shortages of these materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules 
we do not expect significant interruptions in supply  but there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long term 
employees on december   we had approximately  employees  as compared with approximately  employees on december  approximately  of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar type labor arrangements  of which the majority are outside the us based upon the geographic diversification of these employees  we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole

table of contents there are no family relationships among our executive officers 
environmental matters we are committed to the health and safety of people  protection of the environment and compliance with laws  regulations and our policies 
our past and present operations include activities that are subject to domestic including us federal  state and local and international regulations with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
regulation in this area continues to evolve  and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations  as well as the enactment and enforcement of new legislation  may require us and our customers to modify  supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation 
we are involved in voluntary remediation projects at some of our present and former manufacturing locations or other facilities  the majority of which relate to properties obtained in acquisitions or to sites no longer actively used in operations 
on rare occasions  remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency issued consent decree or agreed order 
estimated remediation costs are accrued using currently available facts  existing environmental permits  technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation  our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted 
we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation  remediation or related activities  and such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
if the obligation can only be estimated within a range  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
in general  we seek to accrue costs for the most likely scenario  where known 
accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation 
ongoing environmental compliance costs  such as obtaining environmental permits  installation of pollution control equipment and waste disposal  are expensed as incurred 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act known as superfund or cercla imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault  even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa and appropriate state agencies supervise investigative and cleanup activities at superfund sites 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp in remedial activities related to various superfund sites  and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs of the site based on the ratio of the estimated volume of waste we contributed to the site to the total volume of waste disposed at the site 
prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability for all costs of remediation 
accordingly  a prp may be required to pay more than its proportional share of such costs 
for some projects  it is not possible at this time to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage  or allocation information is not yet available 
however  based upon current information  we do not believe that probable or reasonably possible expenditures in connection with the sites are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements because we have recorded adequate reserves to cover the estimate we presently believe will be our ultimate liability in the matter 
further  other prps involved in the sites have substantial assets and may reasonably be expected to pay their share of the cost of remediation  and  in some circumstances  we have insurance coverage or contractual indemnities from third parties to cover a portion of or the ultimate liability 
during the year ended december   we spent million to comply with domestic and international standards regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment collectively  environmental regulations 
this cost includes the total spent on remediation projects at current or former sites  superfund projects and environmental compliance activities  exclusive of capital expenditures 
in  we expect to spend approximately million to comply with environmental regulations 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  and we estimate we will incur approximately million during based upon current information  we believe that our compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our cost for that compliance is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our total accrual for environmental remediation is million and million  which includes accruals of million and million for the various superfund sites  at december  and  respectively 
we are subject to various other governmental proceedings and regulations  including foreign regulations  relating to environmental matters  but we do not believe that any of these matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and improving our assurance programs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item herein for further discussion of environmental matters 

table of contents item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves various risks 
when considering an investment in our company  one should consider carefully all of the risk factors described below  as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
there may be additional risks  uncertainties and matters not listed below  that we are unaware of  or that we currently consider immaterial 
any of these could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and  thus  the value of an investment in our company 
risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry our business is focused on providing products and services to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry  therefore  our risk factors include those factors that impact  either positively or negatively  the markets for oil and natural gas 
expenditures by our customers for exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas are based on their expectations of future hydrocarbon demand  the risks associated with developing the reserves  their ability to finance exploration for and development of reserves  and the future value of the reserves 
their evaluation of the future value is based  in part  on their expectations for global demand  global supply  excess production capacity  inventory levels  and other factors that influence oil and natural gas prices 
the key risk factors currently influencing the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below 
demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
changes in the global economy or credit market could impact our customers spending levels and our revenues and operating results 
demand for oil and natural gas  as well as the demand for our services  is highly correlated with global economic growth  and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the us  india  and china  as well as developing countries in asia and the middle east who are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average 
the past slowdown in global economic growth and recession in the developed economies resulted in reduced demand for oil and natural gas  increased spare productive capacity and lower energy prices 
weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit market could reduce our customers spending levels and reduce our revenues and operating results 
incremental weakness in global economic activity  particularly in china  india  the middle east and developing asia will reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices 
incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  demand for oil and natural gas could be impacted by environmental regulation  including cap and trade legislation  carbon taxes and the cost for carbon capture and sequestration related regulations 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services 
current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities 
expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 
lower oil and gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers 
while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers  sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth  and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers 
our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk 
any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
many of our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us have been impacted by economic conditions 
access to capital is dependent on our customers ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices  required investments and resulting returns 
limited access to external sources of funding has caused many customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow 
in addition  the combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
starting in late and continuing through the fourth quarter of  we experienced a delay in receiving payments from our customers in venezuela 
as of december   our accounts receivable in venezuela totaled approximately of our total accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   venezuela revenues were approximately of our total consolidated revenues 

table of contents supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our operating results 
productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed  as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 
advanced technologies  such as horizontal drilling  improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline 
access to prospects is also important to our customers 
access to prospects may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves or because another oil and natural gas exploration company owns the rights to develop the prospect 
government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations  may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 
supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual organization of petroleum exporting countries opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries  including  but not limited to  norway and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of oil  to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in spare productive capacity or inventory levels can be indicative of future customer spending to explore for and develop oil and natural gas which in turn influences the demand for our products and services 
spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand 
high or increasing storage or inventories generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften 
low or decreasing storage or inventories are an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise 
measures of maximum productive capacity compared to demand spare productive capacity are also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies 
when spare productive capacity is low compared to demand  energy prices tend to be higher and more volatile reflecting the increased vulnerability of the entire system to disruption 
seasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for our services and operations 
weather can also have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal  and any variation from normal weather patterns  cooler or warmer summers and winters  can have a significant impact on demand 
adverse weather conditions  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  may interrupt or curtail our operations  or our customers operations  cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities  which may or may not be insured 
extreme winter conditions in canada  russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations  or our customers operations  in those areas and result in a loss of revenue 
risk factors related to our business our expectations regarding our business are affected by the following risk factors and the timing of any of these risk factors we operate in a highly competitive environment  which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield services and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend  maintain or increase prices for our products and services  maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers 
in order to be competitive  we must provide new technologies and reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers 
our ability to defend  maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry s capacity relative to customer demand  and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors products and services 
in addition  our ability to negotiate acceptable contract terms and conditions with our customers  especially state owned national oil companies  our ability to manage warranty claims and our ability to effectively manage our commercial agents can also impact our results of operations 
managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at forecasted costs can impact our financial results 
development of competing technology that accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services can have a detrimental impact on our financial results and can result in the potential impairment of long lived assets 

table of contents we may be disadvantaged competitively and financially by a significant movement of exploration and production operations to areas of the world in which we are not currently active 
the high cost or unavailability of infrastructure  materials  equipment  supplies and personnel  particularly in periods of rapid growth  could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 
our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials  component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories 
our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business  including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals  control costs and avoid shortages of raw materials and component parts 
raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys including chromium and nickel  titanium  beryllium  copper  lead  tungsten carbide  synthetic and natural diamonds  electronic components and hydrocarbon based chemical feed stocks 
our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers 
a lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog  which may limit our ability to respond to short lead time orders 
people are a key resource to developing  manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world 
our ability to manage the recruiting  training and retention of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business 
a well trained  motivated work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit  train and retain our employees while managing the impact of wage inflation and potential lack of available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 
likewise  in the current condition of the economy and our markets  we may have to adjust our workforce to control costs and yet not lose our skilled and diverse workforce 
labor related actions  including strikes  slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business 
our business is subject to geopolitical and terrorism risks 
geopolitical risks and terrorist activity continue to grow in several key countries where we do business 
geopolitical risks could lead to  among other things  a loss of our investment in the country and an inability to collect our accounts receivable 
terrorism risks could lead to a loss of our investment in the country  as well as a disruption in business activities 
key oil producing countries in which we do business include angola  brazil  canada  china  norway  russia  saudi arabia  uk  uk and venezuela 
the terms and the impact of the settlement with the department of justice doj and sec may negatively impact our ongoing operations 
under the settlements in connection with the previously disclosed compliance investigations by the doj and sec  we are subject to ongoing review and regulation of our business operations  including the review of our operations and compliance program by an independent monitor appointed to assess our foreign corrupt practices act fcpa policies and procedures 
the activities of the independent monitor will have a cost to us and may cause a change in our processes and operations  the outcome of which we are unable to predict 
in addition  the settlements may impact our operations or result in legal actions against us in the countries that are the subject of the settlements 
also  the collateral impact of settlement in the united states and other countries outside the united states where we do business that may claim jurisdiction over any of the matters related to the doj and sec settlements could be material 
these settlements could also result in third party claims against us  which may include claims for special  indirect  derivative or consequential damages 
our failure to comply with the terms of our agreements with the doj and sec would have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 
the settlements reached with the doj and sec could be substantially nullified and we could be subject to severe sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a subsequent violation by us or any of our employees or our failure to meet all of the conditions contained in the settlements 
the impact of the settlements on our ongoing operations could include limits on revenue growth and increases in operating costs 
our ability to comply with the terms of the settlements is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program  including our ability to continue to manage our agents and business partners and supervise  train and retain competent employees and the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and the baker hughes business code of conduct 

table of contents compliance with and changes in laws or adverse positions taken by taxing authorities could be costly and could affect operating results 
we have operations in the us and in over countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate 
our ability to manage our compliance costs will impact our ability to meet our earnings goals 
compliance related issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries 
changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation  new regulations  new policies  investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations  in particular  changes in export control laws or exchange control laws  additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions  and changes in laws in countries where we operate or intend to operate 
changes that impact the business environment include changes in accounting standards  changes in environmental laws  changes in tax laws or tax rates  the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities  and the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in addition  we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization 
if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings  our effective tax rate could be materially impacted 
these changes could have a significant financial impact on our future operations and the way we conduct  or if we conduct  business in the affected countries 
uninsured claims and litigation could adversely impact our operating results 
we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings 
we have insurance coverage against operating hazards  including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products  to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available  however  no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 
this insurance has deductibles or self insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions 
the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices 
whenever possible  we obtain agreements from customers that limit our liability 
insurance and customer agreements do not provide complete protection against losses and risks  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance 
compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our business is impacted by unexpected outcomes or material changes in environmental liability 
our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental regulations  including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  are only our forecasts regarding these matters 
these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which may be affected by the following factors changes in environmental regulations  a material change in our allocation or other unexpected  adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a prp  including without limitation superfund sites  the discovery of new sites of which we are not aware and where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental regulations  an unexpected discharge of hazardous materials 
a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements have been introduced in the us and various other countries that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other gases 
among these developments are the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol an internationally applied protocol  which has been ratified in canada  the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi in the northeastern united states  and the western regional climate action initiative in the western united states 
also  in  the us supreme court held in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa that certain gases are an air pollutant under the federal clean air act and thus subject to future regulation 
these developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where customers of the company operate and thus adversely affect future demand for products and services of the company  which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations 
control of oil and gas reserves by state owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and create additional risks in our operations 
much of the world s oil and gas reserves are controlled by state owned oil companies 
state owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards  such as joint ventures  that could be difficult or undesirable for the company to meet 
the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact the company s operations in those countries 

table of contents in addition  many state owned oil companies may require integrated contracts or turn key contracts that could require the company to provide services outside its core business 
providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis generally requires the company to assume additional risks 
changes in economic conditions and currency fluctuations may impact our operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business 
most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in us dollars or local currency indexed to us dollars 
some revenue and some local expenses and some of our manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  particularly the british pound sterling  euro  canadian dollar  norwegian krone  russian ruble  australian dollar  brazilian real and the venezuelan bolivar which was devalued by the venezuelan government in january  can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in us dollars and may impact our results of operations 
the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing  if necessary 
if the company s credit rating is downgraded  this would increase borrowing costs under our revolving credit agreements and commercial paper program  as well as the cost of renewing or obtaining  or make it more difficult to renew or obtain or issue  new debt financing 
changes in market conditions may impact any stock repurchases 
to the extent the company engages in stock repurchases  such activity is subject to market conditions  such as the trading prices for our stock  as well as the terms of any stock purchase plans intended to comply with rule b or rule b of the exchange act 
management  in its discretion  may engage in or discontinue stock repurchases at any time 
risk factors related to the merger with bj services our expectations regarding our business may be impacted by the following risk factors related to the pending merger with bj services failure to complete the merger with bj services could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results 
completion of the merger with bj services is not assured and is subject to risks  including the risks that approval of the transaction by stockholders of both baker hughes and bj services is not obtained or that certain other closing conditions are not satisfied 
if the merger is not completed  our ongoing business may be adversely affected and will be subject to several risks  including the following having to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger without receiving the benefits of the merger  including in certain circumstances a termination fee of million to bj services  the attention of our management will have been diverted to the merger instead of on our operations and pursuit of other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us  and resulting negative customer perception could adversely affect our ability to compete for  or to win  new and renewal business in the marketplace 
we will incur substantial transaction and merger related costs as well as assume additional debt from bj services in connection with the merger and our stockholders will be diluted by the merger 
we expect to incur a number of non recurring transaction and merger related costs associated with completing the merger with bj services  combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies 
these fees and costs will be substantial 
additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of baker hughes and bj services 
although we expect that the elimination of certain duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses  will offset the incremental transaction and merger related costs over time  this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term  or at all 
in addition  we will assume approximately million of long term debt from bj services 
the merger will dilute the ownership position of our current stockholders who are expected to hold approximately of the combined company s common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the merger 

table of contents if the merger is completed  we will be subject to additional risks 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to realize these anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of baker hughes and bj services 
however  to realize these anticipated benefits  we must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of bj services into our business 
if we are not able to achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
because we and bj services have operated independently and  until the completion of the merger  we will continue to operate independently  it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees or the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures  practices  policies and compensation arrangements  which could adversely affect the combined company s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the combined company s results of operations could also be adversely affected by any issues attributable to either company s operations that arise or are based on events or actions that occur prior to the closing of the merger 
further  the size of the merger may make integration difficult  expensive and disruptive  adversely affecting our revenues after the merger 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
in addition  we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs or realize other efficiencies from integrating the businesses to offset part or all of the transaction and merger related costs incurred by us 
our performance following the merger  could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain and maintain high technology equipment and certain key employees and to a greater extent by the skilled labor shortages of certain types of qualified personnel  including engineers  project managers  field supervisors  linemen and other qualified personnel  which both baker hughes and bj services have from time to time experienced 
these shortages have also negatively impacted  and may continue to negatively impact  the productivity and profitability of certain projects and can result in lost sales during periods of unanticipated demand 
our inability to bid on new and attractive projects  or maintain productivity and profitability on existing projects  including ones developed by bj services  due to the limited supply of high technology equipment and skilled workers could negatively affect our profitability and results of operation 
in addition  the approval or regulatory requirements of certain government or regulatory agencies in connection with the merger could contain terms  conditions  or restrictions  such as the divestiture of assets or line of business that would be detrimental to the company after the merger 
additionally  even after the statutory waiting period under the anti trust laws and even after completion of the merger  governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  a competitor  customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger  before or after it is completed 
the company or bj services may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the anti trust laws 
upon consummation of the merger  a portion of the combined company s revenues will be derived from its north american operations 
because of the economic environment and related decrease in demand for energy  natural gas exploration and production in north america have decreased significantly from their peak levels in the summer of many factors may adversely impact demand for natural gas and  therefore  demand for oilfield services 
further decline in natural gas exploration and production could cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of the combined company 
such decline could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results and the expected benefits of the merger 
in addition to disclosures in this annual report regarding the company s settlements  as further described in its sec filings  bj services has voluntarily disclosed information found in its internal investigations to the doj and sec and has engaged in discussions with these authorities in connection with their review of possible illegal payments 
neither bj services nor the company can currently predict the outcome of its investigations  when any of these matters will be resolved  or what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  sec  baker hughes independent monitor or other authorities or the effect the actions may have on the business or consolidated financial statements of the combined company 
if the doj or sec were to take action for failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act or terms of agreements with such agencies  it could significantly affect our results of operations 
while a settlement has been proposed in connection with the pending stockholder class action litigation against bj services  its directors and certain officers and baker hughes in connection with the merger  the litigation could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations following the merger if the proposed settlement has not been completed 
demand for the combined company s products and services  including pressure pumping services  could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law 
upon completion of the merger  pressure pumping services will account for approximately of the combined company s revenue 
recently  legislation has been introduced in the united states congress that would authorize the environmental protection 
table of contents agency to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the clean water act 
such regulations could greatly reduce or eliminate demand for the combined company s pressure pumping services 
if such regulation were enacted  the combined company could suffer a significant decrease in revenue 
we are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted  and if so  the impact on the combined company s business
