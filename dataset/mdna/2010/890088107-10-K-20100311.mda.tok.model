overview we developed  manufacture  market and sell advanced radiation therapy solutions to treat a wide range of cancer types 
we market and sell our products to hospitals and cancer treatment centers in north america  europe  the middle east and asia pacific and offer customer support services in each region either directly or through distributors 
the treatment systems in our tomotherapy platform collectively  the system operate on a ring gantry and combine integrated ct imaging with conformal radiation therapy to deliver sophisticated radiation treatments with speed and precision while reducing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue 
our systems include the hi art treatment system  the tomohd treatment system  and the tomomobile relocatable radiation therapy solution 
the hi art treatment system is our flagship product and has been used since to deliver ct guided  helical intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt treatment fractions 
the tomohd treatment system was announced in october  is targeted for shipment in the second half of and includes both our tomohelical and tomodirect treatment modalities to enable cancer centers to treat a broader patient population with a single device 
the tomomobile relocatable radiation therapy solution was first shipped in late  consists of a standard tomotherapy treatment system housed in a movable coach and is designed to improve access and availability of state of the art cancer care 
for the years ended december  and  our revenue was million and million  respectively  a decrease of  and our net loss attributable to shareholders was million and million  respectively  an increase of 
we believe that a combination of the recent global economic downturn  the ongoing credit crisis  uncertainty regarding medical reimbursement rates and national healthcare reform  our transition in sales leadership during the first half of and enhanced competitive pressure negatively affected our volume of systems installed and accepted during as compared to as a result  we recognized revenue on fewer systems in than in although our revenue decreased from the prior year and we experienced a net loss in  we maintained a working capital balance of million  including million of cash and short term investments as of december  thus  we believe we are able to fund ongoing operations and to invest in future product offerings for at least the next months 
during  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of chengdu twin peak accelerator technology inc twin peak  a privately held company based in chengdu  china  for consideration of approximately million 
we believe that twin peak could be a lower cost alternative and secondary source of supply for linear accelerators  a critical component of the system 
in december  we installed our first system containing a twin peak linear accelerator 
we plan to install several more during 
table of contents due to the continued adverse global economic conditions  the ongoing credit crisis  the long sales cycle between customer order and delivery and continued market competition  we expect our revenue performance to be comparable to furthermore  we expect to use approximately million of cash during  mainly to fund our planned operating loss 
although our use of cash will be significantly higher in as compared to  we believe that in we will continue to have sufficient liquidity and limited debt 
despite near term economic challenges and a decline in incoming orders during  we remain confident in the future commercial demand for our technology and product offerings due to our backlog of million as of december   increasing service revenue  planned future new products and product enhancements and anticipated growth in demand for image guided radiation therapy equipment 
factors affecting our financial performance our financial performance is significantly affected by the following factors incoming orders since we sell high priced capital equipment with a transaction cycle that can take many months between customer order and delivery  an important measure of our future financial performance is the dollar value of incoming orders for equipment 
during  we experienced a decline in incoming orders as compared to we believe that this decline resulted from a combination of the global economic downturn  the ongoing credit crisis  our transition in sales leadership during the first half of  increased competitive pressure  uncertainty regarding national healthcare reform and a recent us federal government review of reimbursement rates for healthcare providers 
since the system is a major capital expenditure  our customers may require funding through a credit facility or lease arrangement 
in the current economic environment  many customers are having increased difficulty obtaining the necessary credit or are subject to increased constraints on their use of available cash 
in addition  the current economic environment may cause potential new customers to delay placing capital equipment orders or to purchase equipment that is less costly 
during  some orders we expected to close were not placed  which we believe might be the result of concerns about economic conditions or difficulty obtaining financing 
also  we believe that certain customers delayed their purchase decisions until the centers for medicare and medicaid services finalized and announced their new reimbursement rates for radiation therapy in november we continued to experience increased competition in the marketplace during to counter this  we continue to strive to improve the quality and effectiveness of our sales force  increase our focus on group purchasing organizations and national accounts  increase our emphasis on regional user meetings and expand product features  as evidenced by our previously announced plans to launch tomodirect software 
we have also extended our product portfolio from one to three market offerings by adding two new radiotherapy solutions tomomobile  which is a relocatable radiation therapy system  and the tomohd treatment system  which will include expanded functionality and is expected to be available in late furthermore  we believe continued innovation and expansion of our clinical capabilities will extend our technology leadership position  increase our prospects for greater market share and generate revenue growth 
during  we terminated the distribution agreement with our former japanese distributor  resulting in a temporary stoppage of incoming orders from japan 
effective january   we entered into a distribution agreement with hitachi medical corporation hitachi to distribute the system in japan 
japan is the second largest market in the world for radiation therapy equipment 
we believe hitachi s knowledge of the radiation therapy market will help us regain our momentum in this important market 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of million  the majority of which we believe should convert to revenue within the next months 
we define backlog as the total contractual value of all firm orders received for the system and related options that we believe are likely to ship within months 
to be included in backlog  such orders must be evidenced by a signed quotation or purchase order from the customer or distributor 

table of contents on a regular basis  we review our open orders to determine if they meet our backlog definition by evaluating various factors including site identification  requested delivery date and customer or distributor history 
if they no longer meet our backlog definition  we remove the orders from our backlog 
as a result of this process  we removed several orders from our backlog during the year ended december  reasons for these removals included uncertainty regarding customer project sites and customer shipment schedules 
revenue product revenue 
the majority of our product revenue is generated from sales of the system 
we negotiate the actual purchase price with each customer or distributor  and  historically  the purchase price has varied significantly across geographic regions 
we believe that a combination of the recent global economic downturn  the ongoing credit crisis  uncertainty regarding medical reimbursement rates and national healthcare reform  our transition in sales leadership during the first half of and enhanced competitive pressure caused our revenue to decrease as compared to however  we remain confident in the future commercial demand for our technology and product offerings due to our revenue backlog  increasing service revenue  planned future new products and product enhancements and anticipated growth in demand for image guided radiation therapy equipment 
our revenue projections can be impacted by a number of factors  including the following on average  the system is shipped to our customer within months after we receive the order 
however  on occasion  individual orders may become delayed and take longer than months to ship 
timing of deliveries can be affected by factors out of our control such as construction delays at customer project sites and customer credit issues 
for direct and non certified distributor sales  we recognize revenue upon end customer acceptance of the system  which usually occurs three to four weeks after its delivery 
for certified distributor sales  we recognize revenue upon shipment of the system to the certified distributor 
each system installation represents a significant percentage of our revenue for the period in which it occurs 
our geographic mix of customers may impact our average selling prices 
increased sales of the system outside of north america have tended to favorably impact our gross margins due to higher average selling prices in these markets 
we intend to continue to expand our international selling efforts  although we cannot be certain that favorable pricing trends will continue nor can we be certain of how foreign currency exchange rates will impact our financial results in the future 
our ability to demonstrate the clinical benefits of the system compared to competing systems is a factor in our ability to increase market demand for the system 
to compete effectively  we may need to offer additional features that could require substantial additional resources to develop 
our strategy to target customers in the united states with single or dual linear accelerator centers will depend on that market segment s interest in our recently introduced tomodirect software and tomohd treatment system  which both offer versatility in treatment modality 
to generate interest and penetrate this market  we may need to further develop these product offerings or offer additional features that could require considerable additional investment 
our focus on sales to for profit  multi center customers in the united states may require us to lower selling prices  as these customers tend to negotiate quantity discounts 
in addition  we have a limited history of working with these for profit  multi center customers 
orders from these customers may remain in backlog longer than those from customers who place single unit orders  as units sold to multi center customers tend to install sequentially over a longer period of time 
the system is a major capital equipment item that represents a significant purchase for most of our customers 
if the macroeconomic conditions do not improve  our customers may choose to delay some of their capital spending or may not have or be able to obtain the funds necessary to purchase equipment such as the system 
as a result  our incoming orders and subsequent revenue recognition may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents also included in our product revenue are sales of optional equipment and software enhancements purchased by our end customers 
because we plan to further develop the system by adding upgraded features  we expect continued revenue growth from sales of optional equipment and software enhancements 
service revenue 
our service revenue is generated primarily from post warranty service contracts and the sale of service spare parts 
our service contracts may be purchased with one year or multiple year terms and for a variety of service levels  giving our customers the option to contract for the level of support they desire 
as of december   our most popular service plan was our total tlc service package total tlc 
under total tlc  we provide customers with full spare parts coverage  including installation service by our field service engineers  full scheduled maintenance and unplanned repair service 
we recognize service contract revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
we recognize revenue from spare parts  which are primarily sold to our distributors  upon shipment 
as the number of installed systems continues to grow  we expect growth in our revenue from post warranty service contracts 
our ability to execute our strategies to increase incoming orders  to expand backlog with high quality orders  to raise sales of optional equipment and software enhancements and to grow our service revenue will have a direct impact on our ability to increase overall revenue in the future 
if we are unable to successfully execute these strategies  we may generate revenue at levels that are lower than those we have generated in the past 
cost of revenue cost of revenue includes all of our manufacturing and service costs 
it consists of material  labor and overhead costs incurred in manufacturing the system 
it also includes the cost of shipping the system to the customer site  installation costs  warranty provision and royalty payments to wisconsin alumni research foundation warf  one of our shareholders 
finally  cost of revenue includes customer support expenses required to service and repair the system during the warranty and service contract periods 
in future periods  we expect to improve our gross margins through the following initiatives service and support expenses 
we have a declining number of individual service contracts that produce negative gross profit margins for which we have recorded a reserve for the related estimated future losses 
the decline is due in part to our success in reducing the overall average direct service costs per installed system 
we expect to continue to improve service contract margins by leveraging our service infrastructure costs over a larger installed base  increasing the price for some of our older annual service contracts  training our personnel to improve their problem solving capabilities  implementing remote diagnostic functionalities  outsourcing certain tasks when cost effective and feasible and introducing component design changes aimed at reducing costs  increasing longevity and improving serviceability of our spare parts 
in addition  we believe that achieving certain of these initiatives should also lead to reduced warranty costs and improved system performance 
component supply and cost 
our cost of revenue continues to be impacted by high component costs and high  but declining  replacement rates 
we continue to develop alternate components and implement enhancements to increase the performance of components used in the system 
we are also seeking to identify lower priced components of comparable or improved performance and quality  as well as making engineering improvements to the system in order to reduce costs 
we believe that achieving these goals should result in reduced manufacturing  warranty and service support costs in the long term 
our ability to execute on these strategies to reduce customer support and service expenses  as well as component costs and failure rates  will have a direct impact on our ability to improve profitability in the future 
if we are unable to successfully execute these strategies  we may experience margins that are similar to or lower than our past performance 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for research and development personnel who design and develop future products and product enhancements 
research and development also includes expenses associated with product design and development  the compact particle acceleration corporation 
table of contents cpac proton therapy research project  customer research collaborations and fees to third parties who furnish services related to these activities 
we expect research and development expenses to increase during as compared to  both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  as we intend to increase our spending to support our ongoing product development initiatives 
in addition  we expect to capitalize fewer software development costs related to ongoing product development projects in as compared to  and we expect cpac s expenses to increase during if it can obtain additional third party funding 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salary and benefits for executive management  sales  marketing and other corporate functions 
also included in these expenses are travel  sales commissions  trade shows and marketing materials and expenses related to accounting  legal  tax and other consulting fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of total revenue as compared to  as we intend to increase our selling and marketing expenses to further promote our products to our targeted markets 
in addition  we expect to increase our general and administrative spending  as we plan to add resources to meet the requirements of our corporate functions 
nonoperating expenses because we conduct business in numerous foreign jurisdictions  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our primary exposures are related to foreign currency denominated sales and expenses in europe 
as of december   we did not have a hedging program in place to offset these risks 
interest income since the completion of our initial public offering  we have invested a portion of our cash balances in a short term investment portfolio 
until when interest rates declined sharply  this has led to growing interest income 
we expect interest income to decline in as compared to  due to both lower levels of investable cash and reduced interest rates 
income tax expense benefit we are subject to taxation in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required when evaluating our tax positions and determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including variations in projected taxable income in the numerous geographic locations in which we operate  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets  tax positions taken on tax returns filed in the geographic locations in which we operate  introduction of new accounting standards and changes in tax liabilities to address potential tax exposures related to business and income tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
when deemed necessary  valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized 
this requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
evidence considered during and again in included the existence of cumulative three year losses  a decreased backlog  current year loss and the negative impact of current economic conditions  which resulted in our continuing to record a valuation allowance to offset net deferred tax assets in domestic and certain foreign taxing jurisdictions 
noncontrolling interests our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cpac  our controlled  minority owned affiliate 
although our ownership in cpac is less than  we consolidated cpac  as we hold a call option on certain medical technology of cpac and maintain overall control of cpac s board of directors 
therefore  cpac s outside 
table of contents stockholders interests are shown in our consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests 
if cpac can obtain additional third party funding  we expect our ownership percentage to continue to decline

table of contents product revenue decreased million  or  between years 
the decrease was primarily due to a million decline in revenue related to a lower number of systems installed and accepted during as compared to also contributing to the decrease was a million reduction in revenue related to a decline in the system s average selling price during from  which was primarily caused by a decrease in the system s average selling price in europe and the middle east due largely to a decline in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  revenue related to our optional software packages decreased by million 
finally  we recognized a net reduction to revenue of million during related to our transition of japanese distributors 
service and other revenue increased million  or  between periods 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in service contract revenue  as more systems moved from warranty to service contract coverage 
there were more units covered by service contracts at december  as compared to december  no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue for the years ended december  or cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a reduction of million  or  and  overall  our gross margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  although manufacturing period expenses increased  the increase was more than offset by decreases in product costs due to the installation and acceptance of fewer systems in as compared to  as well as lower total service and support costs and warranty expenses 
manufacturing period expenses increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to our decision to slow manufacturing activity during the first six months of  which led to an increase in unabsorbed costs 
total service and support costs decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  although there was a million increase in our overall service contract costs during due to the larger number of units under service contract at december  as compared to december   such increase was more than offset by several factors  including a an million decline in service infrastructure costs  as travel and overtime expenses decreased million due to a lower number of service repair interventions to our installed base  costs associated with component and software upgrades to the installed base decreased million  employee costs decreased million  as fewer employees were engaged in customer support activities  and outside services decreased million  as we incurred additional expenses during related to our japanese distributor transition  and b a million decrease in our excess and obsolete service inventory provision due to an overall reduction in our spare parts inventory and improved inventory management 
warranty expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as fewer warranty service calls were required due to the improved overall performance of our installed base of systems 
in addition  our average annual cost per direct warranty unit declined from  due mainly to decreases in labor and parts costs  and our base of units under warranty declined from due to a lower number of systems installed and accepted during during  we continued to make progress related to the financial performance of our service contracts 
we charge each service contract with the direct costs associated with performing service at the particular site  including direct labor  overhead  parts and freight 
during  we serviced our growing installed base of systems with a smaller staff of field engineers  invested in training our personnel to improve their diagnostic capabilities and redesigned certain system components

system research and development activities decreased by million primarily due to a million reduction in project spending  as we focused our spending mainly on high priority projects and a million decrease in employee costs  as fewer employees were engaged in research and development activities 
we also capitalized internal development costs of million during related to certain software options that were under development as compared to million in capitalized internal development costs during the proton therapy research project spending decreased by approximately million during  as cpac slowed its development activities during the first quarter of until it received additional third party capital and reduced consultant fees by million during the second half of due to funding limitations

the revolving credit facility bears interest at the one month british bankers association libor plus an interest margin of  adjusted based on monthly changes to such index  and payable monthly 
the credit facility expires on november  and is secured by a general business security agreement 
the facility requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth  a certain ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and a minimum level of cash and short term investments 
we may be considered in default upon a material adverse change in our financial condition or if the bank believes the prospect of payment or performance of the facility is impaired 
we were in compliance with these covenants and there were no amounts outstanding at december  in addition  the facility provides for an adjusted credit limit based on a certain level of tangible net worth and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
based on our levels as of december   the adjusted credit limit was lowered to million effective march  
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table is a summary of our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations notes payable including interest twin peak acquisition payments minimum purchase agreement included in minimum purchase agreement amounts are future purchase obligations under a supply agreement for the purchase of xenon gas detectors from hitachi medical corporation on a non exclusive basis  the agreement expires in june refer to our current report on form k  dated june   for more information 
the table of contractual obligations and commitments does not include royalty payments payable to warf under our license agreement with warf  dated february   as amended 
under the license agreement  the amount of royalty payments due to warf is based on the number of systems sold and therefore cannot be determined accurately in advance 
the license agreement requires a minimum annual payment of million  which we have exceeded in recent years  as royalty expenses were million in  million in and million in unrecognized tax benefits of million  excluding interest and penalties  are not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments  as their resolution cannot be reasonably estimated 
pending litigation on may  and june   two separate complaints were filed by certain of our shareholders in the us district court for the western district of wisconsin the court against us and certain of our officers and all of our independent directors during the period in question 
the complaints were consolidated on october  the consolidated action alleges that the defendants violated the securities act with respect to statements made in connection with the initial and secondary public offerings of our common stock and the exchange act by misrepresenting our projected financial outlook during the period may  through april  the named plaintiffs  michael schultz  john scala  et al  seek to represent persons who purchased our securities between those dates and who were damaged as a result of the decline in the price of our stock between those dates  allegedly attributable to the financial misrepresentations  and seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount 
we moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint on december  on july   the court ruled on the motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint by dismissing without prejudice all claims under the exchange act and all but one claim under the securities act for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted 
on august   the plaintiffs amended the consolidated complaint by filing their second amended consolidated complaint the amended complaint 
we moved to dismiss the amended complaint on september   and on december  the court granted this second motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part 
the plaintiffs have moved for class certification and briefing on that motion is ongoing 
we continue to believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to the allegations contained in the amended complaint  and we intend to pursue these defenses vigorously 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
although we carry insurance for these types of claims and related defense costs  a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   we estimated that our potential loss from these claims and related defense costs will not exceed our insurance deductible of million 

table of contents reserve for contingency during  we terminated our distribution agreement with hi art co  ltd 
hi art  our former distributor in japan 
effective january   we entered into an agreement with hitachi medical corporation hitachi to serve as our new distributor in japan 
in connection with the termination  we entered into an agreement with hi art to acquire certain assets  such as inventory and the regulatory license  and to compensate hi art for certain sales prospects  which we expected to close during the first quarter of while we ultimately were able to transfer some assets to hitachi in order to support the transition  we incurred additional costs and experienced delays 
as a result  the agreement to acquire the identifiable assets remains open and unsettled 
in july  hi art filed a complaint against us in the tokyo district court seeking compensation it claims is owed under the asset acquisition agreement 
although we believe that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to hi art s allegations and intend to pursue these defenses vigorously  there can be no assurance that we will prevail 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve with respect to this matter 
we may change the amount of such reserve from time to time in the future due to new developments or changes in strategy related to this matter 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following revenue generated from sales of the system and service contracts  the performance of the systems operating in the field and corresponding service costs  the level of investment required by our service and support organization  the level of investment required for research and development activities  costs associated with our manufacturing  sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  and effects of competing technological and market developments 
the global economic conditions are volatile and could have potentially negative effects on our near term liquidity and capital resources  including slower collections of receivables  delays in the delivery of existing orders and postponements of incoming orders 
however  we believe that our cash and short term investments as of december   along with the cash we expect to generate from operations during  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
as of december   we had million of cash and short term investments  of which we expect to use approximately million during  mainly because of our planned operating loss 
although our use of cash will be significantly higher in as compared to  we do not expect to draw on our million line of credit  and we believe our financial position will remain sound throughout moreover  we are continually seeking to conserve our cash resources and are carefully monitoring our ongoing expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results 
table of contents of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to understanding our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from system sales  including sales to distributors  and related services when earned 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
payments received for products prior to shipment are recorded as customer deposits 
once a system has been shipped  the related deposits are transferred to deferred revenue until the criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied 
we recognize revenue in connection with distributor sales of systems based on the distributor s certification status 
once a distributor is certified by us to provide installation  testing  training and post installation warranty services to end customers  we recognize revenue upon shipment to that certified distributor  at which time our only remaining obligation is our post installation warranty services to the distributor 
prior to a distributor achieving certification  we recognize revenue upon receipt of the signed acceptance procedure document from the end customer 
distributors do not have any contractual right of return  and we have not accepted any system returns from any distributor 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware and post warranty maintenance services 
judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements  the determination of whether the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical to ensure compliance with us gaap 
the ability to establish the fair value of those undelivered elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue earned involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in instances when evidence of vsoe of all undelivered elements exists  evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements and the fair value of all of the undelivered elements is less than the arrangement fee  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
therefore  to the extent that a discount exists  we attribute the discount entirely to the delivered elements 
payments received for post warranty maintenance services on the system are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract  which generally ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
we sell optional software packages  of which the selling price  cost and functionality are incidental to the operation of the system itself 
we recognize revenue for these optional software packages when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on vsoe of fair value  which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in instances when evidence of vsoe of all undelivered elements exists  evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements and the fair value of all of the undelivered elements is less than the arrangement fee  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
therefore  to the extent that a discount exists  we attribute the discount entirely to the delivered elements 
we record all revenue net of any governmental taxes 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined by the first in  first out method 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand and existing product configurations 
our inventories may become obsolete due to the rapid technological change in our industry 
as changes to the system are released  a determination must be made to identify any parts that are no longer useful 
if a part is determined to be obsolete  a reserve is recorded for the value of the inventory of such on hand 
we also forecast usage and compare this with the quantity of parts on hand 
if it is determined we have excess inventory  we establish a reserve for the excess 
warranty obligations we warrant the system for a period of twelve months following customer acceptance 
upon revenue recognition of each system sale  we accrue a warranty obligation liability for the expected costs 
the accrued warranty obligation costs  which are recorded to cost of revenue  represent our best estimate of the total costs that we expect to incur to repair or replace parts that fail while a system is under warranty 
we monitor warranty costs both to update the historical trend data and to determine if the accrued balance is sufficient to meet our outstanding warranty obligations 
income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the evolving nature and complexity of tax laws combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
under the liability method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by the enacted tax rates 
during  we recorded a valuation allowance reserve against our net deferred tax assets in domestic and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we assessed both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the valuation allowance was established based on our three year cumulative net loss as of december  and our near term financial forecasts 
as a result  we believe that there is a more likely than not possibility that we will not be able to realize the net deferred tax assets during the foreseeable future 
during  we continued to establish a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in domestic and certain foreign jurisdictions primarily based on the substantial book loss incurred during the current year 
our practice for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not criteria  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
upon adoption  we applied this policy to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open 
the unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to federal and state research tax credits 
investment in cpac our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of tomotherapy incorporated  its wholly owned subsidiaries and cpac 
although our ownership in cpac is less than  we have consolidated cpac  as we hold a call option on certain medical technology of cpac and maintain overall control of cpac s board of directors 
therefore  cpac s outside stockholders interests are shown in our consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation to employees  including grants of employee stock options and stock sold pursuant to employee stock purchase plans  is measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the service period of the grant  which is generally the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options 
we use historical stock prices of a peer group of companies as the basis for our volatility assumptions 
the assumed risk free rates are based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected option lives 
we employ the plain vanilla method of estimating the expected term of the options  as we do not have significant historical experience 
the forfeiture rate is based on past history of forfeited options 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying dividends 
we continue to account for options issued prior to january  under an intrinsic value method 
capitalized software development costs software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed when incurred and are included in research and development expense 
technological feasibility is evaluated for each software version developed and can occur early or later in the development cycle depending on the nature of the development project 
once the software has reached technological feasibility  all subsequent software development costs are capitalized until that software is released for sale 
after the software is released for sale  the capitalized software development cost is amortized over the software s useful life  and the related expense is charged to cost of revenue 
we review our capitalized software development costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures 
the new guidance defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued further guidance  which provided a one year deferral of the effective date for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
this guidance applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  as the fasb previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this guidance does not require any new fair value measurements 
the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the new guidance in and the further guidance in did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on business combinations and consolidation  which significantly changed the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling or  what were previously described as minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance in had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  as noncontrolling interests has been reclassified 
as required  the adoption was retrospectively applied to our and consolidated financial statements for purposes of the current presentation 
in march  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on enhanced disclosures for derivative and hedging activities 
the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on earnings per share 
under the new guidance  unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities  and thus  should be included in the two class method of computing earnings per share 
the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our calculation of earnings per share see note d  loss per common share 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification codification  which is the single source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied for financial statements issued for 
table of contents periods ending after september  the codification does not change us gaap and does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities  which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities 
the new guidance was made effective january  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on revenue recognition 
under the new guidance  arrangement consideration in a multiple element arrangement may now be allocated in a manner that more closely reflects the structure of the transaction 
also under the new guidance  tangible products that contain software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be subject to software revenue recognition guidance and will now be subject to other revenue guidance 
the new guidance allows for early or retrospective adoption and will be required january  we elected early adoption of this guidance effective january   and do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relates to changes in market prices of financial instruments that may adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
such risks include changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and inflation 
interest rate risk our investments consist primarily of money market funds and short term marketable debt securities 
while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we do not believe that we are subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments primarily due to the short term nature of our investments 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is subject to change based on the london interbank offered rate 
we do not currently have any borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a significant portion of our sales and expenses historically have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency exchange gains or losses to date 
for the year ended december   approximately of our product revenue was derived from contracts denominated in euros  swiss francs  canadian dollars  british pounds and swedish krona 
for the year ended december   approximately of our product revenue was from contracts denominated in euros 
we operate and staff an office in brussels  belgium and have multiple international subsidiaries  for which we incur foreign currency denominated expenses that are paid directly from the us these expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses in we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk since the exposure has not been material to our historical operating results 
to date  our euro denominated sales orders have included significant down payments  limiting the need to hedge the related currency exchange rate risk 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of the system outside the united states 
to the extent that we can predict the timing of payments under these contracts  we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate such risks in the future 
inflation risk our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in our material and labor costs
