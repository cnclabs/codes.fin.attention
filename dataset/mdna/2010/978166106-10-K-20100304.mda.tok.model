all amounts  other than percentage  in thousands of us dollars year ended december  product revenue percent of revenue revenue percent of revenue revenue percent of revenue alternators starters rods and shafts engine valves and tappets total alternators our alternators are manufactured by jinzhou halla 
an alternator is part of a car engine s electrical system which is connected to the engine belt of a vehicle and converts mechanical energy into electricity to recharge the battery 
the battery  in turn  provides power to all electrical devices in the vehicle  such as the radio  power steering  headlights and windshield wipers 
we have developed  manufactured and sold seven series of alternators  which are represented by different sizes and output rates  in over models 
our alternators current electrical current flows range in size and output from a to a 
larger alternators  as determined by their diameters  have more electrical field coils and can produce stronger currents 
our alternators have dual integrated fans and built in integrated circuit regulators 
our alternators are designed to produce high outputs while remaining small and lightweight 
the size and weight parameters result in the improved cooling performance of integrated fans and higher output from the integrated circuit regulators 
starters our starters are manufactured by jinzhou halla 
a starter is part of a car engine s starting system  along with the starter solenoid 
at ignition  the starter solenoid is activated and provides power for the starter 
the starter then spins the engine a few revolutions to begin the internal combustion process 
the starters produced by our company are known as planetary type starters 
these starters are small and lightweight due to their high speed motors combined with speed reduction systems 
we produce ten series of starters in terms of diameters from to  which produce between kw to kw of power 
rods and shafts our rods and shafts are manufactured by jinzhou wanyou 
our rod and shaft products are mainly used in shock absorber which is a key part in a vehicle s suspension system 
a shock absorber rod is the stem in the shock absorber providing full support of a vehicle s suspension system 
jinzhou wanyou currently produces series of rods and shafts in terms of diameters from to with over  models 
engine valves and tappets our engine valves and tappets are manufactured by jinan worldwide 
engine valves and tappets are used in internal combustion engines to control and facilitate the engine s air intake and exhaust functions 
our engine valves and tappets are critical to optimizing the engine s power output and fuel consumption 
at present  jinan worldwide produces series of engine valves and tappets in term of applications with over models 
we strive to produce high quality products and have established a quality control system to ensure that we achieve this goal 
we have obtained the iso  qs  and ts certificates for our quality management system 
our industry overview of chinese automobile industry china experienced significant economic growth in and has overtaken the us as the world s largest automobile market despite challenging global economic conditions that have had a significant negative impact on the global automobile industry 
according to caam  china s automobile production and sales volumes were million and million units in  representing a and growth rate over  respectively 
sales of passenger cars in china  including sedans  multipurpose vehicles and sport utility vehicles  were million units in  up year over year 
the automobile vehicle population exceeded million units in according to the chinese state minister of public security 
the passenger vehicles population increased by million units  up to million units  representing a growth rate over most of our products are manufactured for use in passenger automobiles with small to medium engines  with displacements of liters or below 
automobiles with these engine displacements produce lower emissions  tend to be more fuel efficient  more environmentally friendly and less expensive 
sales of small to medium engine passenger cars with displacements of liters or below in china were approximately million units in  representing of the total sales of passenger car market in china 
we believe growth in china s automobile industry will primarily be driven by the following factors china s macroeconomic growth 
china s economy has experienced significant growth since the early s 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the gross domestic product  or gdp  in china was rmb trillion in  representing an growth as compared to according to a report published by the organization for economic co operation and development oecd in november  china s gdp growth in is expected to reach approximately  as compared to an expected approximate increase in global gdp 
we believe that a continued increase in china s gdp will generate greater chinese consumer purchasing power for durable goods such as automobiles 
low per capita rate of vehicle ownership 
according to the caam  in  the passenger vehicle ownership rate in china was approximately passenger vehicles per  inhabitants  and even lower in remote areas in china 
according to japan automobile manufacturers association statistics  the average passenger vehicle ownership rate in the united states was more than passenger vehicles per  inhabitants and the world average passenger vehicle ownership rate was over passenger vehicles per  inhabitants in we believe that sales of automobiles in china will experience continued growth  given the significantly lower penetration rate of automobiles in china and rising income levels in china 
increasing urbanization and rising income levels 
overall population growth and a trend towards urbanization have led to significant growth in china s urban population since according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the urbanization rate in china grew at a cagr of in the period from to  while annual disposable income per capita of urban residents grew at a cagr of in the same period 
we expect a growing and increasingly affluent urban population will result in greater need for more efficient and individualized means of transportation  resulting in rising car ownership 
growth of highway infrastructure 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the total length of highways in china increased from million kilometers in to million kilometers in  representing a cagr of 
the growth in the total length of expressways in china has been even faster  with the total length having increased from  kilometers in to  kilometers in  representing a cagr of 
we believe the continued growth of china s highways and related transportation infrastructure is likely to make automobile transportation easier and more efficient resulting in a growing demand for automobiles 
favorable government policies 
the chinese government has adopted a number of measures and initiatives intended to stimulate the growth and development of china s automobile industry 
the following are selected government initiatives that we believe are likely to have a favorable impact on china s automobile industry on september   a measure was adopted by the prc tax authority to reduce the consumption tax rates assessed on low emission vehicles  which is a primary market for our products 
in november  china s state council announced a rmb trillion approximately billion economic stimulus package which increases prc government investment and spending on infrastructure projects  particularly roads  railways and airports 
on january   the chinese state tax bureau implemented a new fuel tax which replaces six other fees imposed on vehicle owners and provides favorable tax treatment to low emission vehicles 
on january   the chinese government announced a stimulus package of rmb billion approximately billion to specifically bolster china s automobile industry  including investment in the development of alternative energy vehicles and parts 
on january   the chinese state tax bureau reduced the sales tax imposed on sales of small engine vehicles with displacements of liters or below by 
the chinese ministry of financing approved and granted rmb billion approximately million for the cars to the countryside program  which is a government subsidy program that became effective on march  under this program  individuals in rural areas who purchase minibuses with engine sizes of liters or below between march  and december  will be entitled to a subsidy of the full price of a vehicle 
on december   the chinese state council announced that the purchase tax for automobiles with displacement of liters or less will be until december  on january   the chinese state tax bureau and the state finance ministry jointly announced a new stimulus package to encourage people to abandon the use of old vehicles for new vehicles  which will combine subsidies for old vehicles with a purchase tax deduction for new vehicles 
we expect the above government measures and initiatives will accelerate the demand for automobiles  particularly low displacement automobiles  in china 
overview of chinese automobile parts industry while the chinese automobile parts industry experienced rapid growth over the past several years  starting in  the chinese automotive parts industry grew at a considerably slower pace than in past years as the global economic crisis took effect 
the number of automobiles in china reached million at the end of  up from according to sinomind consulting  a china based automobile market research and management consulting company  china s sales of automobile parts reached billion in  up from billion in according to the united states department of commerce  china became the second largest exporter of automobile parts into the united states in  overtaking germany and following japan 
we believe that growth in china s auto parts industry will continue due to several important factors 
first  the continued growth of chinese automobile industry will lay a solid foundation for the growth in the oem automobile parts industry 
second  increased levels of car ownership by chinese residents will lead to the growth of the replacement parts market 
finally  as chinese and international automotive manufacturers implement cost savings plans  we expect them to source components directly from low cost manufacturing regions  such as china 
our intellectual property our goal is to utilize our intellectual property to provide us with a competitive advantage 
we currently own patents issued in china relating to our products 
additionally  jinzhou halla has registered the trademark for the logo  and jinan worldwide has registered the trademark for the logo       and with the trademark office of the state administration for industry and commerce of china 
we cannot give any assurance that the protection afforded our intellectual property will be adequate 
it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use  without our consent  intellectual property that we own or are licensed to use 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties  and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights  may adversely affect our business 
see item a  risk factors risks related to our business failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position  and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly 
we may also be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 
see item a  risk factors risks related to our business we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties  which  if determined adversely against us  could disrupt our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties 
sales and marketing we market our products directly to our customers though our sales department which  as of december   consisted of approximately employees 
each member of our sales department receives one month of training in both the business and technical aspects that they will need to perform their job functions 
in addition  we periodically provide continuing educational training for our sales personnel 
members of our sales department generate sales leads by contacting auto manufacturers directly and by attending industry trade shows and exhibitions 
since we have established our status as one of the leading suppliers of alternators  starters  rods and shafts  and engine valves and tappets  our customers may also contact us for new projects 
although most of our business is developed by direct personal contact and referrals from our customers  we also advertise our products in industry trade journals and other industry media 
in order to attract international customers  we also attend international trade shows  such as the automobile shows in frankfurt and las vegas  to raise our brand recognition and promote our products to the international market 
we started selling our products directly to foreign customers in our overseas sales accounted for approximately of our total sales revenue in in addition to our sales and marketing department which performs customer service functions  we also employ outside representatives whose primary function is to understand our customers needs and promote services that best meet their requirements 
these representatives also help our customers resolve installation problems and provide general customer service 
as of december   we had twelve representatives stationed at different major customers  including one mexican representative 
raw materials the raw materials we use to produce our starters and alternators fall into four general categories metal parts  semiconductors  chemicals  and packaging materials 
the main raw materials we use to produce our rods  shafts  engine valves and tappets are iron and steel 
the prices of these raw materials are determined based upon prevailing market conditions  supply and demand 
supply and demand for these raw materials is generally affected by the cyclical nature of the automobile industry and the auto parts industry 
supply and demand is also affected by macroeconomic conditions  including consumer disposable income and spending patterns 
we purchase the majority of our raw materials and components from suppliers located in china  including jiangsu senyuan special steel co  ltd  yingkou die casting products co  ltd  tianjin jingda rea special enamelled wire co  ltd  zhejiang huanfang auto electrical appliance co 
ltd  zhejiang yuhuan solenoid co  ltd  and jinzhou hirvon auto electronics co  ltd 
in situations where we procure raw materials from our subsidiaries  we purchase such materials at cost with no additional mark up and account for such transactions through intercompany cost allocations 
a portion of our raw materials and components are made to our technical specifications  and the remainder of our raw materials and components are non customized 
we consider the raw materials and components that are made to our technical specifications to be proprietary to us  and we have entered into agreements with some of our suppliers which prohibit them from supplying to other third parties these raw materials and components 
we believe that in most instances  raw materials and components made to our technical specifications can be obtained from multiple supply sources 
we generally have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining our requirements for raw materials 
even though multiple supply sources are available to us  our practice has been to utilize limited vendors for certain types of raw materials and components needed in our business based on our past relationship with particular vendors and their abilities to deliver to us high quality raw materials and components on favorable terms 
over the past years  we have been making efforts to diversify our supply channels in order to increase our bargaining power with suppliers 
in  our top five suppliers accounted for approximately of our total cost of sales  decreased from approximately in we utilize local suppliers in close proximity to us  typically within kilometers of our manufacturing facilities  in order to closely supervise their activities  monitor quality  provide technical training and collaborate on technical improvements 
if geographically proximate suppliers continue to be able to provide high quality raw materials and components to us  we intend to continue to source our raw materials and components from them to take advantage of lower shipping costs and favorable quality control capabilities 
our suppliers must meet our quality standards and delivery requirements consistently to remain on our approved supplier list 
if a supplier furnishes suboptimal materials and components to us or is repeatedly late in deliveries  we remove them from our approved supplier list 
we typically purchase the raw materials that we use to produce our products from our suppliers on credit 
credit terms usually permit payment up to days following the delivery of the raw materials 
when we purchase raw materials from chinese suppliers  we are able to pay in rmb 
when we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers  we usually pay in us dollars 
our account payables above six months accounted for  and of our total account payables in  and  respectively 
in  our three biggest suppliers were jiangsu senyuan special steel co  ltd  yingkou die casting products co  ltd 
and tianjin jingda rea special enameled wire co 
ltd  which accounted for approximately  and of our total purchases  respectively 
no suppliers accounted for more than of our total cost of sales in our major customers large automobile manufacturers and automotive engine suppliers are our primary and most desirable customers 
our major customers include  among others  beijing hyundai mobis auto parts  harbin dongan automotive engine co  ltd  shenyang aerospace mitsubishi motors engine co  ltd  weichai engine logistic co  ltd  mianyang xinchen engine co  ltd  shanghai gm wuling automotive co  ltd  guangxi yuchai machinery holdings company  jiangsu mobis auto parts company  magneti marelli suspension system brazil 
as we continue to increase sales in the domestic market  we also intend to grow our overseas sales 
we focus on maintaining long term relationships with our customers 
we have enjoyed recurring orders from most of our customers for periods of four to ten years 
our typical sales contract has a one year term and is usually renewable 
we continued our efforts in diversifying our client base without lowering our total sales revenue 
in  our top three customers accounted for approximately of our total sales revenue as compared to approximately in in  our two biggest customers beijing hyundai mobis auto parts co  ltd  and harbin dongan automotive engine co  ltd 
accounted for approximately and of our total sales revenue  respectively 
no other customers accounted for more than of our sales revenue in we plan to further diversify our customer base in to enhance profitability 
research and development we believe that the development of new products and production methods is important to our success 
we currently operate four research and development centers  each performing different research and development activities 
three of our research and development centers are located at our principal business headquarters in jinzhou  china  focusing on the enhancement of current products  and the development and testing of new alternator  starter and electric motor products 
the other research and development center is located in jinan  china  focusing on the development and testing of new engine valve and tappet products 
as of december   our research and development personnel consisted of approximately employees 
we are often invited by our customers to jointly develop new components tailored to our customers specific requirements 
in  we had joint development programs used in various models of sedans 
our oem customers that we conduct joint development projects with include faw sedans  chery automobile  south korea doosan and shanghai gm wuling 
during the past several years  upon the successful completion of most joint development project  we were engaged as the supplier for the jointly developed products 
we believe that our development period is shorter than many other industry participants due to our dedicated research and development resources and our close proximity to our customers 
many of our major competitors are foreign joint ventures who generally conduct their primary research and development activities in their home countries 
we believe that our china based research and development operations provide us with an advantage over these competitors since we are within geographic proximity to our customers and our research and development personnel are able to communicate directly with our customers in chinese and quickly respond to their product requirements 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  our research and development expenses for new products development  representing salaries of personnel and other costs incurred for research and development of potential new products  were  million and million  representing approximately  and of our total sales revenue in  and  respectively 
the amount incurred for purchase of equipments for research and development were approximately million  million and  representing approximately  and of our total sales revenue in  and  respectively 
backlog our backlog of orders was approximately million as of december  compared to approximately million at december  we anticipate that substantially all of the backlog at the end of will be delivered during in the opinion of management  the amount of backlog is not indicative of trends in our business 
regulation because our operating subsidiaries are located in the prc  we are regulated by the national and local laws of the prc 
there is no private ownership of land in china 
upon payment of a land grant fee  land use rights can be obtained from the government for a period up to years in the case of industrial land and are typically renewable 
we have received the necessary land use rights certificate for the  square feet of land located at no 
yulu street  jinzhou high technology industrial park  jinzhou  china and the  square feet of land located at west bo hai street  open economic zone  jinzhou  china 
we were granted land use rights from the chinese government for  square feet of land located at new century avenue  changqing district  jinan high technology industrial park  shangdong  china 
the land use rights have a year term and will expire on january  this site houses our office building  a research and development center  as well as our production facilities 
we are also subject to china s foreign currency regulations 
the prc government has controlled renminbi reserves primarily through direct regulation of the conversion of renminbi into other foreign currencies 
although foreign currencies  which are required for current account transactions  can be bought freely at authorized prc banks  the proper procedural requirements prescribed by prc law must be met 
at the same time  prc companies are also required to sell their foreign exchange earnings to authorized prc banks  and the purchase of foreign currencies for capital account transactions still requires prior approval of the prc government 
we do not face any significant government regulations in connection with the production of our products 
we do not require any special government permits to produce our products other than those permits that are required for all corporations in china 
our competition the automobile parts market in china is very competitive 
we compete based upon the price and quality of our products  product availability and customer service 
there are approximately major competitors in this market trying to sell the same products that we sell to the same group of target customers 
our primary competitors are located in china and include shanghai valeo automotive electrical systems co 
ltd  hubei shendian auto motor co  ltd 
and zhongqi changdian co  ltd 
with china s entry into the wto and china s agreement to lift its protections to infant industries  we believe that competition will increase in the china auto parts industry segment 
our primary international competitors include valeo france  bosch german  ramy us  mitsubishi motor japan and denso japan 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources  larger staff  and more established market recognition in both domestic chinese and international markets than we have 
environmental compliance our manufacturing facilities are subject to various pollution control regulations with respect to noise and air pollution and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
we are also subject to periodic inspections by local environmental protection authorities 
we believe we are in material compliance with the relevant prc environmental laws and regulations 
we are not currently subject to any pending actions alleging any violations of applicable prc environmental laws 
our employees as of december   we employed  full time employees 
the following table sets forth the number of our full time employees by function 
function number of employees manufacturing and engineering general and administration marketing and sales research and development as required by applicable chinese law  we have entered into employment contracts with all of our officers  managers and employees 
we believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees  and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff for our operations 
our employees in china participate in a state pension scheme organized by chinese municipal and provincial governments 
we are required to contribute to the scheme at the rates of to of the employees salaries and wages 
the compensation expenses related to this scheme was approximately million  million and  for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  we are required by chinese law to cover employees in china with various types of social insurance

item a 
risk factors 
risks related to our business the global economic crisis could further impair the automotive industry thereby limiting demand for our products and affecting the overall availability and cost of external financing for our operations 
the continuation or intensification of the recent global economic crisis and turmoil in the global financial markets may adversely impact our business  the businesses of our customers and our potential sources of capital financing 
our automotive parts are primarily sold to automakers  engine manufacturers and auto parts suppliers 
the recent global economic crisis harmed most industries and has been particularly detrimental to the automotive industry 
since virtually all of our sales are made to auto industry participants  our sales and business operations are dependent on the financial health of the automotive industry and could suffer if our customers experience  or continue to experience  a downturn in their business 
in addition  the lack of availability of credit could lead to a further weakening of the chinese and global economies and make capital financing of our operations more expensive for us or impossible altogether 
presently  it is unclear whether and to what extent the economic stimulus measures and other actions taken or contemplated by the chinese government and other governments throughout the world will mitigate the effects of the crisis on the automotive industry and other industries that affect our business 
these conditions have not presently impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations 
however  the impact of the current crisis on our ability to obtain capital financing in the future  and the cost and terms of the financing  is unclear 
furthermore  deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs  downsizing  industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could have further negative consequences for the automotive industry and result in lower sales  price reductions in our products and declining profit margins 
the economic situation also could harm our current or future lenders or customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
no assurances can be given that the effects of the current crisis will not damage on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a contraction in automotive sales and production could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and liquidity and on the viability of our supply base 
automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and depend  among other things  on general economic conditions and consumer spending and preferences which can be affected by a number of issues including fuel costs and the availability of consumer financing 
as the volume of automotive production fluctuates  the demand for our products also fluctuates 
the global automotive sales and production deteriorated substantially in the second half of and are not expected to rebound significantly in the near term 
while the china automotive sales and production maintained modest growth momentum in and continued to grow in  the growth rate was down from previous years 
a contraction in automotive sales and production could harm our results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  our suppliers would also be subject to many of the same consequences which could pressure their results of operations and liquidity 
depending on an individual supplier s financial condition and access to capital  its viability could be challenged which could impact its ability to perform as we expect and consequently our ability to meet our own commitments 
escalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business 
pricing pressure in the automotive supply industry has been substantial and is likely to continue 
many vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term of the contract 
price reductions have impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future 
if we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures  those price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to accurately project market demand for our products  our business expansion plan could be jeopardized and our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
if actual customer orders are less than our projected market demand  we will likely suffer overcapacity problems and may have to leave capacity idle  which may reduce our overall profitability and hurt our financial condition and results of operations 
even though our business increasingly has included more international sales  we derive most of our sales revenue from sales of our products in china 
the continued development of our business depends  in large part  on continued growth in the automotive industry  especially in china 
although china s automotive industry has grown rapidly in the past  it may not continue to grow at the same growth rate in the future or at all 
however  the developments in our industry are  to a large extent  outside of our control and any reduced demand for automotive parts products and services  any other downturn or other adverse changes in china s automotive industry could severely harm our business 
our business is capital intensive and our growth strategy may require additional capital which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations are sufficient to meet our present and reasonably anticipated cash needs 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions  implementation of our strategy to expand our manufacturing capacity or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our own financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
given the current global economic crisis  financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us  or at all  could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects 
due to our rapid growth in recent years  our past results may not be indicative of our future performance so evaluating our business and prospects may be difficult 
our business has grown and evolved rapidly in recent years as demonstrated by our growth in annual sales revenue from approximately million in to million in we may not be able to achieve similar growth in future periods  and our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business  financial performance and prospects 
moreover  our ability to achieve satisfactory manufacturing results at higher volumes is unproven 
therefore  you should not rely on our past results or our historical rate of growth as an indication of our future performance 
we face risks associated with future investments or acquisitions 
an important element of our growth strategy is to invest in or acquire businesses that will enable us  among other things  to expand the products we offer to our existing target customer base  lower our costs for raw materials and components and capitalize on opportunities to expand into new markets 
we recently acquired controlling interests in several complementary businesses  including friend birch limited and its subsidiaries which we expect to contribute to our future growth 
in the future  we may be unable to identify other suitable investment or acquisition candidates or may be unable to make these investments or acquisitions on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we complete an investment or acquisition  we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction 
integrating an acquired business is distracting and time consuming  as well as a potentially expensive process 
we are currently in the process of integrating our operations with the operations of recently acquired companies 
the successful integration of these companies and any other acquired businesses require us to integrate and retain key management  sales  research and development  production and other personnel  incorporate the acquired products or capabilities into our offerings from an engineering  sales and marketing perspective  coordinate research and development efforts  integrate and support pre existing supplier  distribution and customer relationships  and consolidate duplicate facilities and functions and combine back office accounting  order processing and support functions 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including our ability to successfully commercialize our strategic investments  increased expenses  including travel  legal  administrative and compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees  increased costs to integrate personnel  customer base and business practices of the acquired company with our own  adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write down of goodwill associated with acquisitions  potential disputes with sellers of acquired businesses  technologies  services  products and potential liabilities  potential liabilities as a result of assumption of liabilities of acquired companies  and dilution to our earnings per share if we issue common stock in any acquisition 
moreover  geographic distance between business operations  the compatibility of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures being combined also present significant challenges 
acquired businesses are likely to have different standards  controls  contracts  procedures and policies  making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems 
our focus on integrating operations may also distract attention from our day to day business and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
performance problems with an acquired business  technology  product or service could also have a material adverse impact on our reputation as a whole 
any acquired business  technology  product or service could significantly under perform relative to our expectations 
in addition  although we have conducted due diligence with respect to our recently acquired companies  there may still be unidentified issues and hidden liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  in connection with our acquisition of jinan worldwide  a previously state owned enterprise  the local chinese government may  among other things  require us fulfill obligations of the prior owner of jinan worldwide to contribute additional capital of approximately rmb million into jinan worldwide by may and achieve certain performance targets with respect to jinan worldwide 
if we cannot overcome these challenges  we may not realize actual benefits from past and future acquisitions  which will impair our overall business results 
our acquisition strategy also depends on our ability to obtain necessary government approvals 
see risks related to doing business in china we may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations which became effective on september  we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of strategic investment in jinheng holding  which could hurt our ability to grow our business and harm our financial condition 
as part of our growth strategy  we will continue to explore and make strategic investments in business that is complementary or additive to our core business and product offerings 
for instance  on january   through two separate transactions  we made a strategic investment in which we acquired an aggregate of of equity interest in applaud group limited  and  thereby  owner of of jinheng holding  which manufactures airbag safety devices for automobiles 
we expect to utilize our strategic investment in jinheng holding to further strengthen and broaden our research and development expertise  expand customer base and improve value added services 
however  the success of the strategic investment depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control 
mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks 
for instance  the commercial aspects and goals of our strategic investment may not materialize as desired or yield the commercial benefits sought 
moreover  regardless of whether the commercial aspects and goals of the strategic investment prove to be positive  an strategic investment in another company comes with the typical investment risks  such as the partial or total loss of investment in the worst case 
our inability to pinpoint and make favorable strategic investments  from both a commercial and investment perspective and our inability to effectively manage the associated risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the case of jinheng holding  our strategic investment may decline in value and or may not meet our desired objectives 
if we do not successfully manage the risks associated with this and other acquisitions and strategic investments  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with covenants in our loan agreements  our lenders may allege a breach of a covenant and seek to accelerate the loan or exercise other remedies  which could strain our cash flow and harm our business  liquidity and financial condition 
in connection with loans made to us by several commercial lenders  we have entered into loan agreements which impose upon us certain financial and operating covenants 
the financial covenants require us to satisfy certain financial metrics and maintain financial ratios deemed appropriate by our lenders 
the operating covenants often require us to take certain actions  such as keeping current on our debt payments  delivering reports to our lenders and so forth  or refraining from taking actions without the lender s consent or at all  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures  paying dividends or distributions or acquiring other business or assets 
even though we strive to comply with our covenants  we have failed in the past  and may fail in the future  to do so and our lenders may notify us of such non compliance and seek to accelerate a loan or exercise other remedies 
for instance  under our loan agreement with deg deutsche investitions und entwicklungsgesellschaft mbh  or deg  dated november   we agreed not to make certain acquisitions without prior consent of deg 
for some of our recent acquisitions  we did not obtain prior approval from deg  but instead have subsequently informed deg about the acquisitions 
we have not received from deg any written notice of non compliance or breach as we believe our subsequent notices have remedied any problems 
however  we cannot assure you that deg will not  in the future  send a notice of breach to us and require acceleration of the loan  in which case we currently believe we have adequate cash to meet the payment obligation 
if  in the future  we fail to comply with our loan agreement covenants  and we receive a notice of non compliance or default  we will attempt to cure any non compliance and or negotiate appropriate waivers with our lenders 
if we cannot cure any non compliance or obtain a waiver  our lenders may declare us to be in default  which would give them the right to accelerate our outstanding indebtedness 
if any larger amount of our indebtedness is accelerated as a result of a default  we may be forced to repay our loans earlier than expected  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and financial condition 
any interruption in our production processes could impair our financial performance and negatively affect our brand 
we manufacture or assemble our products primarily at our facilities in jinzhou and jinan  china 
our manufacturing operations are complicated and integrated  involving the coordination of raw material and component sourcing from third parties  internal production processes and external distribution processes 
while these operations are modified on a regular basis in an effort to improve manufacturing and distribution efficiency and flexibility  we may experience difficulties in coordinating the various aspects of our manufacturing processes  thereby causing downtime and delays 
we have also been steadily increasing our production capacity and have limited experience operating at these higher production volume levels 
in addition  we may encounter interruption in our manufacturing processes due to a catastrophic loss or events beyond our control  such as fires  explosions  labor disturbances or violent weather conditions 
any interruptions in our production or capabilities at our facilities could result in our inability to produce our products  which would reduce our sales revenue and earnings for the affected period 
if there is a stoppage in production at any of our facilities  even if only temporary  or delays in delivery times to our customers  our business and reputation could be severely affected 
any significant delays in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future sales 
we currently do not have business interruption insurance to offset these potential losses  delays and risks so a material interruption of our business operations could severely damage our business 
part of our strategy involves the development of new products  and if we fail to timely develop new products or we incorrectly gauge the potential market for new products  our financial results will be adversely affected 
we plan to utilize our in house research and development capabilities to develop new products that could become new sources of sales revenue for us in the future and help us to diversify our revenue base 
for example  we acquired the research and development center owned by friend birch limited which is focused on developing new technology for rods and shafts 
our future research and development efforts will continue to be focused on expanding our product offering beyond our current products into other similar products and components for different applications  such as hub motors for electric bicycles and electric vehicles 
if we fail to timely develop new products or if we miscalculate market demand for new products that we develop  we may not be able to grow our sales revenue at expected growth rates and may incur expenses relating to the development of new products that are not offset by sufficient sales revenue generated by these new products 
exporting our products outside of china is an important component of our overall growth strategy  which could subject us to various economic  political  regulatory  legal and foreign exchange risks 
we currently sell most of our products in china 
our overseas sales accounted for  and of our total sales revenue in  and  respectively 
we plan to selectively enter international markets in which an opportunity to sell our products has been identified 
the marketing  distribution and sale of our products overseas expose us to a number of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in designing products that are compatible with product standards in foreign countries  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  increased marketing and sales costs  difficulty and costs of compliance with foreign regulatory requirements and different commercial and legal requirements  an inability to obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights in foreign countries  changes to import and export regulations  including quotas  tariffs and other trade barriers  delays or difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses  repatriation controls on foreign earnings and currency conversion restrictions  and difficulty in engaging and retaining distributors and agents who are knowledgeable about  and can function effectively in  overseas markets 
if we cannot effectively manage these risks  our ability to conduct or expand our business abroad would be impaired  which may in turn hamper our business  financial condition and prospects 
if we cannot keep pace with market changes and produce automotive parts with new technologies in a timely and cost efficient manner to meet our customers requirements and preferences  the growth and success of our business will be hindered 
the automotive parts market in china is characterized by increasing demand for new and advanced technologies  evolving industry standards  intense competition and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
if we cannot keep pace with market changes and produce automotive parts incorporating new technologies in a timely and cost efficient manner to meet our customers requirements and preferences  the growth and success of our business will suffer 
from time to time  new products  product enhancements or technologies may replace or shorten the life cycles of our products or cause our customers to defer purchases of our existing products 
shorter product life cycles may require us to invest more in developing and designing new products and to introduce new products more rapidly  which may increase our costs of product development and decrease our profitability 
in addition  we may not be able to make such additional investments and any additional investments we make in new product development and introductions may not be successful 
even if we develop and introduce new products  their market acceptance is not assured and depends on the perceived advantages of our new products over existing competing products  our ability to attract vehicle manufacturers who are currently using our competitors products  product cost relative to performance  and the level of customer service available to support new products 
therefore  commercial acceptance by customers of our products may not occur at our expected rate or level  and we may not be able to successfully adapt existing products to effectively and economically meet customer demand  thus impairing the return from our investments 
we may also be required under applicable accounting standards to recognize a charge for the impairment of assets to the extent our existing products become uncompetitive or obsolete or if any new products fail to achieve commercial acceptance 
any such charge may jeopardize our ability to operate profitably 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position  and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly 
we strive to strengthen and differentiate our product portfolio by developing new and innovative products and product improvements 
as a result  we believe that the protection of our intellectual property will become increasingly important to our business 
implementation and enforcement of intellectual property related laws in china has historically been lacking due primarily to ambiguities in prc intellectual property law 
accordingly  protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights in china may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries 
currently  we hold prc patents that relate to various product configurations and product components 
we will continue to rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  trademarks and copyrights to provide protection in this regard  but this protection may be inadequate 
for example  our pending or future patent applications may not be approved or  if allowed  they may not be of sufficient strength or scope 
as a result  third parties may use the technologies and proprietary processes that we have developed and compete with us  which could negatively affect any competitive advantage we enjoy  dilute our brand and harm our operating results 
in addition  policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and given the relative unpredictability of china s legal system and potential difficulties enforcing a court judgment in china  there is no guarantee litigation would result in an outcome favorable to us 
furthermore  any such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention away from our core business 
an adverse determination in any lawsuit involving our intellectual property is likely to jeopardize our business prospects and reputation 
we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs so we would be forced to bear all litigation costs if we cannot recover them from other parties 
all of the foregoing factors could harm our business and financial condition 
we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties  which  if determined adversely against us  could disrupt our business and subject us to significant liability to third parties 
our success largely depends on our ability to use and develop our technology  know how and product designs without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of other intellectual property rights of third parties 
the holders of patents and other intellectual property rights potentially relevant to our product offerings may be unknown to us or may otherwise make it difficult for us to acquire a license on commercially acceptable terms 
we have not registered and do not own the logo 
wonder auto group limited  a hong kong company controlled by mr 
qingjie zhao  our chairman  chief executive officer and president and is now dormant  has registered the trademark in hong kong 
jinzhou wonder auto suspension system co  ltd 
has registered the trademarks and in china 
we have not been able to register the logo in china because it is similar to the trademarks registered by jinzhou wonder auto suspension system co  ltd 
an independent third party entity has registered the jinzhou halla trademark in china 
we currently do not sell any products or services using the marks similar to the trademarks registered by jinzhou wonder auto suspension system co  ltd 
or jinzhou halla trademarks 
we have entered into an agreement with jinzhou wonder auto suspension system co  ltd 
under this agreement  jinzhou wonder auto suspension system co  ltd 
has agreed not to bring any legal action against us for using the mark in china 
however  we cannot assure you that no action will be brought against us based on our use of 
there may also be technologies licensed to and relied on by us that are subject to infringement or other corresponding allegations or claims by others which could damage our ability to rely on such technologies 
in addition  although we endeavor to ensure that companies that work with us possess appropriate intellectual property rights or licenses  we cannot fully avoid the risks of intellectual property rights infringement created by suppliers of components used in our products or by companies with which we work in cooperative research and development activities 
our current or potential competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have obtained or may obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products in china or other countries 
the defense of intellectual property claims  including patent infringement suits  and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming  and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel 
furthermore  an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceeding to which we may become a party could cause us to pay damage awards  seek licenses from third parties  pay additional ongoing royalties  which could decrease our profit margins  redesign our products  or be restricted by injunctions 
these factors could effectively prevent us from pursuing some or all of our business objectives and result in our customers or potential customers deferring  canceling or limiting their purchase or use of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on certain technologies licensed to us from third parties and the loss of these licenses or failure to renew such licenses on a timely basis could interrupt our production and have a material adverse impact on our business 
we rely on certain technologies licensed to us from third parties for manufacturing our products 
through our licensing arrangements  we are able to integrate third party technologies into our products 
we can also produce and sell products that are more suitable for specific types of vehicles utilizing these licensed technologies 
if certain licenses are terminated  or not timely renewed  the production of our products using the licensed technologies would be disrupted and our business and financial condition could be damaged 
if any of our licensors is alleged to have infringed on any other party s proprietary right  we may be prevented from using the technology in question  thus disrupting our production 
we may be subject to contractual obligations that limit our ability to sell our automotive parts in certain markets 
when we enter into commercial arrangements  we strive to negotiate the most favorable contractual provisions for our company with respect to both pricing and other terms 
in some commercial arrangements  we have negotiated exclusivity  preferred vendor and non competition arrangements that are favorable to our company 
in other instances  counterparties to some of our commercial arrangements have imposed such provisions upon us 
for instance  in one of our commercial arrangements  we are restricted from selling certain products using intellectual property licensed from the other party to some foreign companies  joint ventures with foreign companies and companies in countries where the licensor has business 
while we believe that our commercial arrangements  when considered in their entirety  are favorable to our business  certain commercial arrangements may restrict our ability to freely sell our products on terms favorable to us or at all  which could have a negative impact on our sales revenue and our ability to grow and expand our business 
if we fail to maintain or improve our market position or respond successfully to changes in the competitive landscape  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our competition includes a number of global and prc based manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours 
we compete primarily on the basis of quality  technological innovation and price 
our main competitors include shanghai valeo automotive electrical systems co  ltd  a joint venture of shanghai auto industrial group and valeo group  hubei shendian auto motor co  ltd  a joint venture of hubei shendian auto electrical equipment co  ltd  zhongqi changdian co  ltd 
and remy international  inc  bosch group  mitsubishi motors corporation and denso corporation 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger global market share  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater economies of scale  as well as greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result of these competitive pressures and expected increases in competition  we may price our products lower than our competitors in order to maintain market share 
any lower pricing may negatively affect our profit margins 
if we fail to maintain or improve our market position and respond successfully to changes in the competitive landscape  our business and results of operations may suffer 
a large percentage of our sales revenue is derived from sales to a limited number of customers  and our business will suffer if sales to these customers decline 
a significant portion of our sales revenue historically has been derived from a limited number of customers 
our top five customers accounted for approximately of our sales in and in any significant reduction in demand for vehicles manufactured by any of these major customers and any decrease in their demand for our products could harm our sales and business operations 
the loss of one or more of these customers could damage our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot obtain sufficient raw materials and components at a reasonable cost  our ability to produce and market our products  and thus our business  could suffer 
we purchase raw materials and component parts for our products from various suppliers located primarily in asia  most of which are located in china and a few of which are located in south korea 
the raw materials we use to produce our starters and alternators fall into four general categories metal parts  semiconductors  chemicals  and packaging materials 
the main raw materials we use to produce our rods  shafts  engine valves and tappets are iron and steel rods 
the majority of our raw materials and components are purchased from suppliers in china  including jiangsu senyuan special steel co  ltd  yingkou die casting products co  ltd  tianjin jingda rea special enameled wire co 
ltd  zhejiang huanfang auto electrical appliance co 
ltd  and zhejiang yuhuan solenoid co  ltd 
purchases from our top five raw materials and component parts suppliers accounted for approximately of our total purchases in we may experience a shortage in the supply of certain raw materials and components in the future  and if any such shortage occurs  our manufacturing capabilities and operating results of operations could be negatively affected 
if any supplier is unwilling or unable to provide us with high quality raw materials and components in required quantities and at acceptable costs  we may not be able to find alternative sources on satisfactory terms in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  some of our suppliers may fail to meet qualifications and standards required by our customers now or in the future  which could impact our ability to source raw materials and components 
our inability to find or develop alternative supply sources could result in delays or reductions in manufacturing and product shipments 
moreover  these suppliers may delay shipments or supply us with inferior quality raw materials and components that may adversely impact the performance of our products 
the prices of raw materials and components needed for our products could also increase  and we may not be able to pass these price increases on to our customers 
if any of these events occur  our competitive position  reputation and business could suffer 
if our customers and or the ultimate consumers of the vehicles that use our products successfully assert product liability claims against us due to defects in our products  our operating results may suffer and our reputation may be harmed 
our products are used primarily in low emission passenger vehicles 
significant property damage  personal injuries and even death can result from malfunctioning vehicles 
if our products are not properly designed  built or installed or if people are injured because of our products  we could be subject to claims for damages based on theories of product liability and other legal theories 
the costs and resources to defend such claims could be substantial and  if such claims are successful  we could be responsible for paying some or all of the damages 
we have maintained product liability insurance only for products manufactured by jinzhou wanyou  which are sold in the united states and canada 
negative publicity from such claims may also damage our reputation  regardless of whether such claims are successful 
any of these consequences resulting from defects in our products would hurt our operating results and  in turn  the value of our common stock 
our products may become subject to recall in the event of defects or other performance related issues 
like many other participants in the automotive industry  we are at risk for product recall costs which are costs incurred when  either voluntarily or involuntarily  a product is recalled through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance defect 
costs typically include the cost of the product  part or component being replaced  the cost of the recall borne by our customers and labor to remove and replace the defective part or component 
our products have not been the subject of an open recall 
if a recall decision is made  we will need to estimate the cost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period 
in making this estimate  judgment is required as to the quantity or volume to be recalled  the total cost of the recall campaign  the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and  in some cases  the extent to which the supplier of the part or component will share in the recall cost 
as a result  these estimates are subject to change 
excessive recall costs or our failure to adequately estimate these costs may negatively affect our operating results 
we depend heavily on key personnel  and loss of key employees and senior management could harm our business 
our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel  including qingjie zhao  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  meirong yuan  our director  chief financial officer and treasurer  yuncong ma  our chief operating officer  seuk jun kim  our vice president of new product development  yuguo zhao  our vice president of sales and marketing and yongdong liu  our vice president of production 
they also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management  technical  marketing and sales and support personnel for our operations 
if we lose a key employee  if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed  our business could suffer 
turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team and impair our operations 
in addition  if any of these key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  we may lose some of our customers 
we have entered into confidentiality and non competition agreements with all of these key personnel 
however  if any disputes arise between these key personnel and us  it is not clear  in light of uncertainties associated with the prc legal system  what the court decisions will be and the extent to which these court decisions could be enforced in china  where all of these key personnel reside and hold some of their assets 
see risks related to doing business in china uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us 
certain of our existing stockholders have substantial influence over our company  and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders 
mr 
qingjie zhao  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  he has significant influence over our business  including decisions regarding mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  election of directors and other significant corporate actions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a future change of control  which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our shares 
mr 
qingjie zhao s association with other businesses could impede his ability to devote ample time to our business and could pose conflicts of interest 
mr 
qingjie zhao  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  owns of china wonder limited  a company listed on the alternative investment market of the london stock exchange  which is principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of specialty packaging machinery to the prc pharmaceutical market 
he also serves as an executive director of jinheng holdings  a company listed on the hong kong stock exchange of which we have a indirect ownership 
in addition  mr 
zhao serves as the chairman of jinzhou wonder alternative energy automobile technology co  ltd  which is principally engaged in the research and manufacture of electrical vehicles  jinzhou qingjie electrical power technology co  ltd  which has no current operations but will engage in the battery business  and jinzhou wonder packing machinery co  ltd  which is principally engaged in pharmaceutical packaging 
mr 
zhao devotes most of his business time to our affairs and the remainder of his business time to the affairs of other companies 
mr 
zhao s decision making responsibilities for these companies are similar in the areas of public relations  management of human resources  risk management and strategic planning 
also  we may enter into agreement with these parties to sell or buy goods and services to or from them 
as a result  conflicts of interest may arise from time to time 
we will attempt to resolve any such conflicts of interest in our favor 
additionally  even though mr 
zhao is accountable to us and our stockholders as a fiduciary  which requires that he exercise good faith and due care in handling our affairs  his existing responsibilities to other entities may limit the amount of time he can spend on our affairs 
problems with product quality or product performance could result in a decrease in customers and revenue  unexpected expenses and loss of market share 
our operating results depend  in part  on our ability to deliver quality products on a timely and cost effective basis 
as our products become more advanced  it may become more difficult to maintain our quality standards 
if we experience deterioration in the performance or quality of any of our products  it could result in delays in shipments  cancellations of orders or customer returns and complaints  loss of goodwill and harm to our brand and reputation 
furthermore  our products are used together with components and in motor vehicles that have been developed and maintained by third parties  and when a problem occurs  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
in addition  some automobile parts and components may not be fully compatible with our products and may not meet our or our customers quality  safety  security or other standards 
the use by customers of our products with incompatible or otherwise substandard components is largely outside of our control and could result in malfunctions or defects in our products and result in harm to our brand 
these problems may lead to a decrease in customers and revenue  harm to our brand  unexpected expenses  loss of market share  the incurrence of significant warranty and repair costs  diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  customer relation problems or loss of customers  any one of which could materially adversely affect our business 
environmental claims or failure to comply with any present or future environmental regulations may require us to spend additional funds and may harm our results of operations 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations that affect our operations  facilities and products in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
some of our newly incorporated chinese subsidies have not obtained pollutant discharge permits required by chinese laws 
other than the foregoing  we believe that we are in material compliance with all material environmental  health and safety laws and regulations related to our products  operations and business activities 
although we have not suffered material environmental claims in the past  the failure to comply with any present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us  suspension of production  cessation of our operations or even criminal sanctions 
new regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses 
our failure to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspension of our business operations  which could cause damage to our business 
we have limited insurance coverage and do not carry any business interruption insurance  third party liability insurance for our manufacturing facilities or insurance that covers the risk of loss of our products in shipment 
operation of our facilities involves many risks  including equipment failures  natural disasters  industrial accidents  power outages  labor disturbances and other business interruptions 
furthermore  if any of our products are faulty  then we may become subject to product liability claims or we may have to engage in a product recall 
we do not carry any business interruption insurance  product recall or third party liability insurance for our manufacturing facilities or with respect to our products to cover claims pertaining to personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from defaults with our products  product recalls  accidents on our property or damage relating to our operations 
we have obtained product liability insurance only for products manufactured by jinzhou wanyou which are sold to customers in the united states and canada 
therefore  our existing insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all risks associated with our business 
as a result  we may be required to pay for financial and other losses  damages and liabilities  including those caused by natural disasters and other events beyond our control  out of our own funds  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  under the shipping terms of some of our customer contracts  we bear the risk of loss in shipment of our products 
we do not insure this risk 
while we believe that the shipping companies that we use carry adequate insurance or are sufficiently solvent to cover any loss in shipment  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately reimbursed upon the loss of a significant shipment of our products 
we may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have the operating effectiveness of our internal controls attested to by our independent auditors 
as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports and the independent registered public accounting firm auditing a company s financial statements to attest to and report on the operating effectiveness of such company s internal controls 
although our independent auditor has provided a positive attestation for the year ended december   we can provide no assurance that we will comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby and we will receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors in the future 
in the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner or we are unable to receive a positive attestation from our independent auditors with respect to our internal controls  investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
our holding company structure may hinder the payment of dividends 
wonder auto technology  inc has no direct business operations  other than its ownership of our subsidiaries 
while we have no current intention of paying dividends  should we decide in the future to do so  as a holding company  our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments 
in addition  our operating subsidiaries  from time to time  may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us due to restrictive covenants in loan agreements  restrictions on the conversion of local currency into us dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below 
if future dividends are paid in renminbi  fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of renminbi into us dollars may reduce the amount received by us stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into us dollars 
prc regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations 
our subsidiaries in china are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to prc accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds 
currently  our subsidiaries in china are the only sources of sales revenue or investment holdings for the payment of dividends 
if they do not accumulate sufficient profits under prc accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by prc accounting standards  we will be unable to pay any dividends 
china passed a new enterprise income tax law  or the new eit law  and its implementing rules  both of which became effective on january   which provide that dividends sourced from china payable to non resident enterprises shall be subject to chinese enterprise income tax at a rate of 
such dividend tax rate may be reduced by applicable tax treaties or arrangements 
under the new eit law and its implementation rules  dividend payments between qualified chinese resident enterprises are exempted from enterprise income tax 
however  due to the short history of the new eit law  it remains unclear as to the detailed qualification requirements for such exemption and whether dividend payments from our chinese subsidiaries to us will be exempted from enterprise income tax if we are considered as a chinese resident enterprise for tax purposes 
risks related to doing business in china adverse changes in political and economic policies of the prc government could impede the overall economic growth of china  which could reduce the demand for our products and damage our business 
we conduct substantially all of our operations and generate most of our revenue in china 
accordingly  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic  political and legal developments in china 
the prc economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects  including the higher level of government involvement  the early stage of development of the market oriented sector of the economy  the rapid growth rate  the higher level of control over foreign exchange  and the allocation of resources 
as the prc economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market oriented economy  the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources 
while these measures may benefit the overall prc economy  they may also have a negative effect on us 
although the prc government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform  the prc government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in china through the allocation of resources  controlling payment of foreign currency denominated obligations  setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways 
any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in china could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth and the level of automotive investments and expenditures in china  which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
uncertainties with respect to the prc legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us 
we conduct substantially all of our business through our operating subsidiaries in china 
our operating subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in china and  in particular  laws applicable to foreign invested enterprises 
the prc legal system is based on written statutes  and prior court decisions may be cited for reference  but have limited precedential value 
since  a series of new prc laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in china 
however  since the prc legal system continues to rapidly evolve  the interpretations of many laws  regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws  regulations and rules involve uncertainties  which may limit legal protections available to you and us 
in addition  any litigation in china may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
in addition  all of our executive officers and all but one of our directors are residents of china and not of the united states  and substantially all the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
as a result  it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process in the united states or to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states against our chinese officers  directors and subsidiaries 
the prc government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities 
the prc government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the chinese economy through regulation and state ownership 
our ability to operate in china may be harmed by changes in its policies  laws and regulations  including those relating to taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  property and other matters 
we believe that our operations in china are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
however  the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new  stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations 
accordingly  government actions in the future  including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies  could have a significant effect on economic conditions in china or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in chinese properties or joint ventures 
restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales revenue effectively 
most of our sales revenue and expenses are denominated in renminbi 
under prc law  the renminbi is currently convertible under the current account  which includes dividends and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment and loans 
currently  our prc operating subsidiaries may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions  including payments of dividends to us  without the approval of the state administration of foreign exchange  or safe  by complying with certain procedural requirements 
however  the relevant prc government authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future 
since a significant amount of our future revenue will be denominated in renminbi  any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in renminbi to fund our business activities outside china that are denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange transactions by prc operating subsidiaries under the capital account continue to be subject to significant foreign exchange controls and require the approval of or need to register with prc government authorities  including safe 
in particular  if our prc operating subsidiaries borrow foreign currency through loans from us or foreign lenders  these loans must be registered with safe  and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions  these capital contributions must be approved by certain government authorities  including the ministry of commerce  or their respective local counterparts 
these limitations could affect our prc operating subsidiaries ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing 
fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities 
the value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and the renminbi and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated 
because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are denominated in renminbi and our financial results are reported in us dollars  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi will affect our balance sheet and our earnings per share in us dollars 
in addition  appreciation or depreciation in the value of the renminbi relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into us dollars and earnings from  and the value of  any us dollar denominated investments we make in the future 
since july  the renminbi has no longer been pegged to the us dollar 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future the prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
very limited hedging transactions are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited  and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert renminbi into foreign currencies 
currently  some of our raw materials  components and major equipment are imported 
in the event that the us dollars appreciate against renminbi  our costs will increase 
if we cannot pass the resulting cost increases on to our customers  our profitability and operating results will suffer 
in addition  since our sales to international customers are growing rapidly  we are increasingly subject to the risk of foreign currency depreciation 
failure to comply with prc regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by prc residents may subject our prc resident stockholders to personal liability  limit our ability to acquire prc companies or to inject capital into our prc subsidiaries  limit our prc subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially adversely affect us 
in october  safe issued the notice on relevant issues in the foreign exchange control over financing and return investment through special purpose companies by residents inside china  generally referred to as circular  which required prc residents to register with the competent local safe branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose company  or spv  for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of china on the strength of domestic prc assets originally held by those residents 
internal implementing guidelines issued by safe  which became public in june known as notice  expanded the reach of circular by purporting to cover the establishment or acquisition of control by prc residents of offshore entities which merely acquire control over domestic companies or assets  even in the absence of legal ownership  adding requirements relating to the source of the prc resident s funds used to establish or acquire the offshore entity  covering the use of existing offshore entities for offshore financings  purporting to cover situations in which an offshore spv establishes a new subsidiary in china or acquires an unrelated company or unrelated assets in china  and making the domestic affiliate of the spv responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in connection with any such registration  notably  the business plan which describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds 
amendments to registrations made under circular are required in connection with any increase or decrease of capital  transfer of shares  mergers and acquisitions  equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in china to guarantee offshore obligations  and notice makes the offshore spv jointly responsible for these filings 
in the case of an spv which was established  and which acquired a related domestic company or assets  before the implementation date of circular  a retroactive safe registration was required to have been completed before march   this date was subsequently extended indefinitely by notice  which also required that the registrant establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the spv and its affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
failure to comply with the requirements of circular  as applied by safe in accordance with notice  may result in fines and other penalties under prc laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions 
any such failure could also result in the spv s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital  share transfer or liquidation to the spv  or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out of china 
we recently acquired yearcity limited and its subsidiary jinan worldwide  as well as fuxin huirui and have not registered these companies with the relevant branch of safe  as currently required 
we plan to make the proper registration in the next few months 
we have asked our stockholders who are prc residents as defined in circular to register with the relevant branch of safe  as currently required  in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions of equity interests in our prc subsidiaries 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that they can obtain the above safe registrations required by circular and notice moreover  because of uncertainty over how circular will be interpreted and implemented  and how or whether safe will apply it to us  we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future strategies 
for example  our present and prospective prc subsidiaries ability to conduct foreign exchange activities  such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency denominated borrowings  may be subject to compliance with circular and notice by our prc resident beneficial holders 
in addition  such prc residents may not always be able to complete the necessary registration procedures required by circular and notice we also have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures 
a failure by our prc resident beneficial holders or future prc resident stockholders to comply with circular and notice  if safe requires it  could subject these prc resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions  restrict our overseas or cross border investment activities  limit our subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure  which could adversely affect our business and prospects 
we may be unable to complete a business combination transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and acquisition regulations which became effective on september  on august   six chinese regulatory agencies promulgated the regulation on mergers and acquisitions of domestic companies by foreign investors  which became effective on september   or the m a regulations 
this regulation  among other things  governs the approval process by which a chinese company may participate in an acquisition of assets or equity interests 
depending on the structure of the transaction  the regulation will require the chinese parties to make a series of applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies 
in some instances  the application process may require the presentation of economic data concerning a transaction  including appraisals of the target business and evaluations of the acquirer  which are designed to allow the government to assess the transaction 
government approvals will have expiration dates by which a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies 
compliance with the regulations is likely to be more time consuming and expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over the combination of two businesses 
accordingly  due to this regulation  our ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly more complicated  time consuming and expensive  and we may not be able to negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently protect their interests in a transaction 
the regulation allows chinese government agencies to assess the economic terms of a business combination transaction 
parties to a business combination transaction may have to submit to the ministry of commerce and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report  an evaluation report and the acquisition agreement  all of which form part of the application for approval  depending on the structure of the transaction 
the regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower than the appraised value of the prc business or assets and in certain transaction structures  require that consideration must be paid within defined periods  generally not in excess of a year 
the regulation also limits our ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition  including aspects of the initial consideration  contingent consideration  holdback provisions  indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and allocation of assets and liabilities 
transaction structures involving trusts  nominees and similar entities are prohibited 
therefore  such regulation may impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders economic interests 
in addition to the above risks  in many instances  we will seek to structure transactions in a manner that avoids the need to make applications or a series of applications with chinese regulatory authorities under these m a regulations 
if we fail to effectively structure an acquisition in a manner that avoids the need for such applications or if the chinese government interprets the requirements of the m a regulations in a manner different from our understanding of such regulations  then acquisitions that we have effected may be unwound or subject to rescission 
also  if the chinese government determines that our structure of any of our acquisitions does not comply with these regulations  then we may also be subject to fines and penalties 
failure to comply with chinese regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock ownership plans or share option plans may subject the prc plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions 
in december  the people s bank of china promulgated the administrative measures for individual foreign exchange  which set forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by chinese individuals under either the current account or the capital account 
in january  safe issued the implementation rules of the administrative measures for individual foreign exchange  which  among other things  specified approval requirements for certain capital account transactions such as a chinese citizen s participation in the employee stock ownership plans or stock option plans of an overseas publicly listed company 
on march   safe promulgated the processing guidance on foreign exchange administration for domestic individuals participating in employee stock holding plans or stock option plans of overseas listed companies 
under this rule  prc citizens who are granted stock options by an overseas publicly listed company are required  through a qualified prc domestic agent or prc subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company  to register with safe and complete certain other procedures 
we and our chinese employees who receive stock option grants will be subject to this rule 
our board of directors has adopted the wonder auto technology  inc equity incentive plan 
if we or the chinese optionees fail to comply with these regulations  we or these optionees may be subject to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions 
prc regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to prc entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our prc operating subsidiaries 
as an offshore holding company of our prc operating subsidiaries  we may make loans to our prc subsidiaries 
any loans to our prc subsidiaries are subject to approval by relevant governmental authorities in china and other requirements under relevant prc regulations 
we may also decide to finance our prc subsidiaries by means of capital contributions 
according to the relevant prc regulations on foreign invested enterprises in china  depending on the amount of total investment and the type of business in which a foreign invested enterprise is engaged  capital contributions to foreign invested enterprises in china are subject to approval by the ministry of commerce or its local branches 
we may not obtain these government approvals on a timely basis  if at all  with respect to future capital contributions by us to our prc subsidiaries 
if we fail to receive such approvals  our ability to capitalize our prc operations may be negatively affected  which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business 
under the new eit law  we may be classified as a resident enterprise of china 
such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc stockholders 
on march   the national people s congress of china passed the new eit law  and on november   the state council of china passed the new eit law implementing rules which took effect on january  under the new eit law  an enterprise established outside of china with de facto management bodies within china is considered a resident enterprise  meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes 
the implementing rules of the new eit law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations  personnel  accounting  and properties of the enterprise 
on april   the state administration of taxation issued the notice concerning relevant issues regarding cognizance of chinese investment controlled enterprises incorporated offshore as resident enterprises pursuant to criteria of de facto management bodies  or the notice  further interpreting the application of the new eit law and its implementation non chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities 
pursuant to the notice  an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a non domestically incorporated resident enterprise if i its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in china  ii its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in china  iii its substantial assets and properties  accounting books  corporate chops  board and shareholder minutes are kept in china  and iv at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in china 
a resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of when paying dividends to its non prc shareholders 
however  it remains unclear as to whether the notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated by a chinese natural person 
nor are detailed measures on imposition of tax from non domestically incorporated resident enterprises are available 
therefore  it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case 
we may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by chinese tax authorities 
if the prc tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes  a number of unfavorable prc tax consequences could follow 
first  we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of on our worldwide taxable income as well as prc enterprise income tax reporting obligations 
in our case  this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non china source income would be subject to prc enterprise income tax at a rate of 
second  although under the new eit law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our prc subsidiaries would qualify as tax exempt income  we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a withholding tax  as the prc foreign exchange control authorities  which enforce the withholding tax  have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes 
finally  it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation in which a withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non prc shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non prc shareholders from transferring our shares 
we are actively monitoring the possibility of resident enterprise treatment for the tax year and are evaluating appropriate organizational changes to avoid this treatment  to the extent possible 
if we were treated as a resident enterprise by prc tax authorities  we would be subject to taxation in both the us and china  and our prc tax may not be creditable against our us tax 
risks related to the market for our stock generally the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which could negatively affect us and holders of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for instance  if our financial results are below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly 
other factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include announcements relating to significant corporate transactions  fluctuations in our quarterly and annual financial results  operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us  and changes in government regulation or proposals relating to us 
in addition  since the middle of  the us securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets 
market fluctuations and broad market  economic and industry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
you may not be able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above your purchase price  or at all 
any volatility of or a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock could also negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions using common stock 
further  if we were to be the object of securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources  which could negatively affect our financial results 
the market price of our stock may be affected by low volume 
our common stock has a relatively low average daily volume 
reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three month period ended march   was approximately million shares 
without a significantly larger average trading volume  our common stock will be less liquid than the common stock of companies with higher trading volume  as a result  the trading prices for our common stock may be more volatile 
we do not intend to pay dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock 
we intend to retain any future earnings to fund the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change of control 
our articles of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock may be issued in one or more series  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors without further action by the stockholders 
these terms may include preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion rights  redemption rights and sinking fund provisions 
the issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock  and therefore could reduce the value of such common stock 
in addition  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with  or sell assets to  a third party 
the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult  delay  discourage  prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change in control  which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock

we sell our products primarily within china to well known domestic and international automobile oems  engine manufacturers and automotive parts suppliers 
we are increasingly exporting our products to international markets 
our customers include saic gm wuling automobile co  ltd  beijing hyundai motor company  shenyang aerospace mitsubishi motors engine co  ltd  harbin dongan automotive engine co  ltd  shanghai volkswagen co  ltd  byd company limited  tianjin toyota co  ltd  chery automobile co  ltd  dongfeng yueda kia motors co  ltd  geely automobile co  ltd  tianjin faw xiali automobile co  ltd  and a major north american automobile oem 
most of our customers subject us to a rigorous product qualification process to ensure that our products meet their quality standards 
we believe that the complex and stringent requirements of each customer s qualification process acts as a barrier to entry for many new market entrants 
our strategically located manufacturing facilities in jinzhou and jinan  china house our high quality manufacturing  testing and research and development capabilities 
we currently have four alternator assembly lines  four starter assembly lines  twenty engine valves production lines  five tappets production lines and three rods and shafts production lines 
our current annual production capacity is approximately million units of alternators  million units of starters  million units of engine valves and tappets  and million units of rods and shafts  assuming two work shifts per day with eight hours each 
in november  we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the offering was made under the company s shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
 filed with the securities and exchange commission on august  recent developments on january   through two separate transactions  we acquired an aggregate of of equity interest in applaud group limited which is a british virgin islands corporation and has no assets other than its ownership of of equity interest in jinheng holding 
as a result of the acquisition of an aggregate of of applaud  we will become the largest shareholder of applaud and  thereby  owner of of jinheng holdings 
jinheng holdings is a high tech automotive parts supplier that is primarily engaged in developing  manufacturing and selling components of automotive passive safety restraint systems airbag and seatbelt  automotive engine electronic injection management systems  and components of diesel engines 
jinheng holdings is listed on the hong kong stock exchange 
our ceo and chairman qingjie zhao is an executive director of jinheng holdings 
we expect to utilize our strategic investment in jinheng holding to further strengthen and broaden our research and development expertise  expand customer base and improve value added services 
our strategic priorities we have six strategic priorities designed to create long term sustainable growth for our company and value for our shareholders 
these strategic priorities are vertical integration  sales expansion into select international markets  increasing production capacity  strengthening of our research and development capabilities  developing new products and focusing on supplying parts and components for low emission vehicles 
our core capabilities as we operate and grow our business  we seek to enhance and capitalize on what we view as our core capabilities described below leading market position 
according to caam  in we ranked second and third in sales revenue in the chinese market for automobile alternators and starters  respectively 
our subsidiary jinan worldwide  which we acquired in october  has been producing engine valves and tappets for over years  and we believe we are now one of the largest manufacturers of engine valves and tappets in china in terms of sales volume as a result of the acquisition 
we believe our brand and our products are well recognized and accepted in the automotive industry in china 
established supplier network 
we purchase the majority of raw materials and components used in our products through a network of low cost suppliers  primarily located within close proximity to our manufacturing facilities 
we have established long term relationships with many of our suppliers 
our established supplier network enables us to maintain a competitive low cost structure  shorten our product lead times  closely monitor product quality and enjoy sourcing stability 
proprietary manufacturing processes 
we have invested substantial time and resources in developing customized assembly lines and equipment to optimize our manufacturing efficiency 
our proprietary manufacturing processes and customized equipment provide flexibility and efficiency  achieve shorter lead times  improve quality assurance  reduce equipment downtime and material wastage and provide greater cost competitiveness 
strong long term customer base 
we are a qualified supplier of automotive components to many leading automobile industry players in china and worldwide 
given the high switching costs and rigorous qualification processes of our customers  we believe many of them have come to rely on us as a primary supplier of key components based on our proven ability to meet their growing demand and quality standards 
principal factors affecting our financial performance our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors general economic conditions 
our financial results will be influenced by general economic conditions  the financial stability of our customers and suppliers  consumer confidence levels  instability and fluctuations in the capital markets and other unforeseen factors 
notwithstanding the global economic downturn  china s gdp growth in is expected to reach approximately  substantially higher than the global gdp growth rate which is projected to be approximately 
since most of our sales revenue is generated from the chinese market  we expect to benefit from the continued economic growth in china 
currently  it will also be challenging to maintain our historic growth rate due to general economic conditions which may reduce the demand for our products and overall ability and cost of external financing for our operations 
to meet this challenge  we plan to focus on further integrating our operations and generating greater synergies across our portfolio of technologies  products  and subsidiaries 
we also plan to focus on increasing our manufacturing and administrative efficiencies through targeted cost savings initiatives 
government policies 
the prc government has adopted a number of measures and initiatives to spur the growth and development of small engine and low emission vehicles 
these measures include reduction of consumption tax rates assessed on low emission vehicles  implementation of a new fuel tax which provides favorable tax treatment to low emission vehicles and a sales tax deduction imposed upon the sales of small engine vehicles with displacements of l and below 
we anticipate these measures will have a positive impact on sales of our products 
we also intend to capitalize on the favorable government policies on alternative energy vehicles by deepening our penetration into that market and by developing products for use in electric vehicles 
export 
recent market events  especially the global economic slow down  the challenging automotive industry conditions and the continued global credit crisis  are adversely impacting global automotive demand which may adversely impact our business  especially our exports 
export sales may also subject us to various economic  political  regulatory  legal and foreign exchange risks 
however  we also see great opportunities for expanding our market share in the international market 
as international automotive manufacturers implement cost saving plans  we expect them to source components directly from low cost manufacturing regions  such as china 
we believe our high quality  low cost products will be attractive to international automakers and engine manufacturers 
in addition  our subsidiary jinzhou wanyou is specialized in the manufacturing of rods and shafts 
with more and more oversea automakers ceasing to manufacture rods and shafts themselves due to cost concerns  we anticipate more sales opportunities for our rods and shafts in the oversea market 
we also plan to utilize our existing export sales network and resources to sell engine valves and tappets manufactured by our recently acquired subsidiary jinan worldwide 
this strategy  if successfully implemented  will further increase our export sales

on march   the national people s congress of china passed the new eit law  and on november   the state council of china passed its implementing rules  both of which took effect on january  the new eit law and its implementing rules impose a unified eit of on all domestic invested enterprises and foreign invested enterprises  unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions 
despite these changes  there will be a transition period for enterprises  whether foreign invested or domestic  that are currently receiving preferential tax treatments granted by relevant tax authorities 
enterprises that are subject to an eit rate lower than may continue to enjoy the lower rate and will transition into the new eit rate over a five year period beginning on the effective date of the new eit law 
enterprises that are currently entitled to exemptions for a fixed term will continue to enjoy such treatment until the exemption term expires 
preferential tax treatment will continue to be granted to industries and projects that qualify for such preferential treatments under the new eit law 
as approved by the relevant tax authority in the prc  jinzhou halla  jinzhou dongwoo  jinzhou wanyou  jinzhou hanhua  jinzhou karham  fuxin huirui and jinan worldwide were entitled to two years exemption from the first profit making calendar year of operations after offset of accumulated taxable losses  followed by a tax reduction for the immediate next three calendar years

in addition to the changes to the current tax structure  under the new eit law  an enterprise established outside of china with de facto management bodies within china is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an eit of on its global income 
the implementing rules define the term de facto management bodies as an establishment that exercises  in substance  overall management and control over the production  business  personnel  accounting  etc  of a chinese enterprise 
if the prc tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise  then our organization s global income will be subject to prc income tax of 
for detailed discussion of prc tax issues related to resident enterprise status  see item a  risk factors risks related to our business under the new eit law  we may be classified as a resident enterprise of china 
such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non prc stockholders 
in addition  the new eit law and its implementing rules generally provide that a withholding tax applies to china sourced income derived by non resident enterprises for prc enterprise income tax purposes unless the jurisdiction of incorporation of such enterprises shareholder has a tax treaty with china that provides for a different withholding arrangement 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax income and non tax deductible expenses incurred 
our management carefully monitors these legal developments and will timely adjust our effective income tax rate when necessary

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
share based compensation 
the company adopted the provisions of asc previously sfas r  which requires the use of the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost related to employee stock options or similar equity instruments which are equity classified awards  is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period  which is usually the vesting period 
asc also requires measurement of cost of a liability classified award based on its current fair value 
fair value of share options granted is determined using the black scholes model 
under this model  certain assumptions  including the risk free interest rate  the expected life of the options and the estimated fair value of the company s common stock and the expected volatility  are required to determine the fair value of the options 
if different assumptions had been used  the fair value of the options would have been different from the amount the company computed and recorded  which would have resulted in either an increase or decrease in the compensation expense 
use of estimates 
in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
these accounts and estimates include  but are not limited to  the valuation of accounts receivable  inventories  deferred income taxes  provision for warranty  goodwill  know how  share based compensation and the estimation on useful lives of property  plant and equipment 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of the collectability of trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the amount of the allowance  the company considers the historical level of credit losses and applies percentages to aged receivable categories 
the company makes judgments about the creditworthiness of each customer based on ongoing credit evaluations  and monitors current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
based on the above assessment  during the reporting years  the management establishes the general provisioning policy to make allowance equivalent to of gross amount of trade receivables due over year 
additional specific provision is made against trade receivables aged less than year to the extent which they are considered to be doubtful 
bad debts are written off when identified 
the company extends unsecured credit to customers ranging from three to six months in the normal course of business 
the company does not accrue interest on trade accounts receivable 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not significantly deviated from the general allowance estimated by the management and no significant additional bad debts have been written off directly to the profit and loss 
this general provisioning policy has not changed in the past since establishment and the management considers that the aforementioned general provisioning policy is adequate and not too excessive and does not expect to change this established policy in the near future

the company recognizes impairment of long lived assets and investment in an affiliate in the event that the net book values of such assets exceed the future undiscounted cashflows attributable to such assets 
during the reporting periods  the company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for impairment 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of the company s products is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer at the time when the products are put into use by its customers  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
warranty 
it is the policy of the company to provide after sales support to the product of alternators and starters by way of a warranty program 
the company provided warranties to certain customers with warranty periods ranging from two years or  km to three years or  km  whichever comes first 
based on the past experience  the company sets up a policy of making a general provision for warranty such that the closing balance of this provision is equal to certain percentage of relevant sales during the reporting periods as follows year ended december  as of january   the management of the company re assessed the percentage for provision of warranties by reviewing the historical claims information and determined to adjust the percentage from to 
such decrease was attributable to the improvement in the rate of defects for the company s products after introduction of certain new technologies obtained from the company s research and development 
following the acquisition of yearcity in october   the company maintains its policy to provide after sales support to the product of engine valves and tappets by way of a warranty program

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short term bank loans and long term bank loans 
although the interest rates  which are based on the banks prime rates with respect to our short term loans are fixed for the terms of the loans  the terms are typically three to twelve months for short term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal 
there were no material changes in interest rates for short term bank loans renewed during the year ended december  a hypothetical increase in the annual interest rates for all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as of december   would decrease net income before provision for income taxes by approximately million for the year ended december  management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in rmb 
all of our assets are denominated in rmb except for cash 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
in addition  we also have bank loan denominated in euro and our payment obligation may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and rmb 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the value of the rmb against the us dollar  euro and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
since july  the rmb has not been pegged to the us dollar 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or euro in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in rmb exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
