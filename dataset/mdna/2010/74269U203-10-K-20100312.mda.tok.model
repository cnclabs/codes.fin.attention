table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our annual report are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from t hose anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of evolved network traffic awareness  analysis  and control solutions based on deep packet inspection dpi technology for a broad range of broadband service providers worldwide 
our products offer network operators network traffic identification  control and service management 
we have more than customers who have installed over  of our systems in total 
our customers include cable multi system operators  mobile service providers  telecommunications companies  universities and other entities 
our products are marketed under the packetlogic brand name 
we have multiple products that address a broad market spectrum of customers from megabits up to gigibits 
our packetlogic family of products offers accuracy 
our proprietary drdl software solution allows us to provide our customers with a high degree of application identification accuracy and the flexibility to regularly update the software to keep up with the rapid introduction of new internet applications  scalability 
our family of products is scalable from a few hundred megabits to gigabits of traffic per second  up to million subscribers and up to million simultaneous data flows  which is critical to service providers as they upgrade to docsis a high bandwidth broadband cable standard  fttx high bandwidth fiber to the home or neighborhood used by telecom broadband network providers  and lte enabling higher bandwidth mobile phone networks technologies in the access network  and platform flexibility 
our products are deployable in many locations in a network and leverage off the shelf hardware  and can rapidly leverage advances in computing technology which we believe to be a better solution than those which are dependent on specific network silicon processors or hardware platforms 
we face competition from suppliers of standalone dpi products such as allot communications  arbor networks  blue coat systems  brocade communications systems  cisco systems  ericsson  juniper networks  and sandvine corporation 
some of our competitors supply platform products with different degrees of dpi functionality  such as switch routers  routers  session border controllers and voip switches 
most of our competitors are larger and more established enterprises with substantially greater financial and other resources 
some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us 
as a result of such competition  we could lose market share and sales  or be forced to reduce our prices to meet competition 
however  we do not believe there is a dominant supplier in our market 
based on our belief in the superiority of our technology  we see an opportunity for us to capture meaningful market share and benefit from what we believe will be growth in the dpi market 
we were incorporated in  and in october  we merged with zowcom  inc  a publicly traded nevada corporation 
we acquired netintact ab  a swedish corporation  and netintact pty  an australian company  in following the acquisitions of netintact ab and netintact pty  our core products and business changed substantially to focus on dpi solutions 
packetlogic  the flagship product and technology of netintact  now is the company s principal product offering 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  resellers  distributors  and systems integrators in the americas  asia pacific  and europe 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our audited financial statements for the year ended december  in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
revenue recognition our most common sale involves the integration of our software and a hardware appliance 
the software is essential to the functionality of the product 
we account for this revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  or asc  for all transactions involving software 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer resulting in the existence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred evidenced when product title transfers to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
our product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
virtually all of our sales include post contract support pcs services categorized as support revenue which consist of software updates and customer support 
software updates provide customers access to a constantly growing library of electronic internet traffic identifiers signatures and rights to non specific software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes internet access to technical content  telephone and internet access to technical support pe rsonnel and hardware support 
receipt of a customer purchase order is the primary method of determining persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery generally occurs when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
however  product revenue based on channel partner purchase orders is recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as we have established significant experience with the channel partner s ability to complete the sales process 
additionally  when we introduce new products for which there is no historical evidence of acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of end user acceptance until such history has been established 
since our customer orders contain multiple items such as hardware  software  and services which are delivered at varying times  we determine whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting as prescribed under asc asc states that delivered items should be considered separate units of accounting if delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and if delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in our control 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
through december   in virtually all of our contracts  the only element that remained undelivered at the time of product delivery was pcs services 
we determine vsoe for pcs based on the rate charged to customers based upon renewal pricing for pcs 
each contract or purchase order that we enter into includes a stated rate for pcs 
the renewal rate is generally equal to the stated rate in the original contract 
we have a history of such renewals  the vast majority of which are at the stated renewal rate on a customer by customer basis 
under the residual method  the fair value of the und elivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have a fair value is pcs  revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in support revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately and for support and updates is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 

table of contents our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we review our long lived assets including property and equipment and purchased intangible for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
an impairment test involves a comparison of undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment losses were incurred in the periods presented 
as a result of the acquisition of netintact ab and netintact pty in  we have goodwill of  on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  this goodwill was measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the amount assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value at a reporting unit level 
we operate in one segment  which is considered to be the sole reporting unit and therefore  we tested our goodwill at the enterprise level 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
as of december   we completed the first step of its annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary 
allowance for doubtful account the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces trade receivables to the amount that is ultimately believed to be collectible 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed regularly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessment of a customer s ability to pay 

table of contents stock based compensation we apply the provisions of asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we elected the modified prospective adoption method  under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of asc apply to new grants  to unvested grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and to all outstanding awards subsequently modified 
estimated compensation for unvested grants that wer e outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost previously estimated for the asc pro forma disclosures 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock based on its historical volatility over a period equivalent to the expected term of the option 
we estimate the expected term of stock options using historical exercise data 
we use the exact number of days between the grant and the exercise dates to calculate a weighted average of the holding periods for all awards ie  the average interval between the grant and exercise or post vesting cancellation dates adjusted as appropriate 
we determine the risk free interest rate for a period equivalent to the expected term of the option by extrapolating from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures based on our his torical experience 
accounting for income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with asc  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
management believes that sufficient uncertain ty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been provided against net deferred tax assets 
tax expense has taken into account any change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets where the realization of various deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty
