table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we currently own and operate restaurants located in states 
we offer freshly prepared food  personalized service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with whom we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american favorites as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
our menu is mostly standardized for all of our restaurants  allowing us to deliver consistent quality meals 
we believe that our vast menu and generous portions  combined with an average check of approximately  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
over the last four years  we have funded development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering  a private offering of common stock completed during november  the rights offering completed during june  and cash flows from operations 
we opened four restaurants during in richmond  virginia  woodbridge  new jersey  eden prairie  minnesota  and tampa  florida 
we plan to open one restaurant in baltimore  maryland during we target our restaurants to achieve an average annual unit volume of million following months of operations 
recent openings are trending lower than our targeted volume during the current recession 
we continue to believe that in a stable economic environment our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests begin to discover our concept and we begin to generate market awareness 
our restaurants are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
sales in most of our restaurants typically are higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
during  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges for six underperforming restaurants 
the asset impairment charges resulted from an evaluation of the long term prospects of each of these restaurants that have not been meeting sales  profitability  and cash flow targets 
we have no plans to close any of these restaurants  however  we will continue to evaluate each of these restaurants to determine whether operating performance can be improved 
we experience various trends in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will take approximately six months to achieve operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient operating that unit 
as a result  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on costs of sales  labor  occupancy  restaurant operating expenses  and preopening expenses 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 

table of contents key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 
same store sales percentage change 
same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change in same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average weekly sales 
average weekly sales represents the average of restaurant sales measured over consecutive monday through sunday time periods 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for all of our restaurants open for at least months before the beginning of the period measured 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our restaurants open for at least months  divided by the total leasable square feet for such restaurants 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  preopening expenses  or asset impairment charges 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance prior to application of corporate overhead 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors 
this measure provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to more easily determine future financial results driven by growth and allows investors to more easily compare restaurant level profitability

we expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred  and we expect preopening expenses to be similar for each new restaurant opening  which typically commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening 
our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and gains and losses on disposal of assets 
asset impairment charge

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  restaurant operating costs and preopening costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales  impairment of long lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures  changes in borrowings and interest rates  general economic conditions  weather conditions or natural disasters  timing of certain holidays  changes in government regulations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for new restaurant development 
subject to availability of capital on terms acceptable to us  we will pursue additional leases based on significant economic opportunity 
similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform site related work and to construct and equip each restaurant 
the average investment cost for our restaurants depends upon the type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for the construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our typical restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances between million and million  and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately million 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  permitting requirements  labor markets and other variables 
restaurants that are subject to ground leases and do not receive landlord tenant improvement allowances typically require a significantly higher cash investment 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements amounts in thousands december  december  cash and short term investments net working capital deficit at december  and  cash and short term investments exclude million and million  respectively  in auction rate securities that are used as collateral for the line of credit 
proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities are used to reduce the outstanding balance on the line of credit 
the working capital deficit at december   is primarily attributable to accruals for payroll  legal fees  and severance 
the working capital deficit at december  is principally due to million of investments in auction rate securities which were classified as non current assets 
cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants  have historically been significant 
over the last several years  we funded development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of equity financing  debt financing  and cash flows from operations 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and the credit market environment 
our current operations generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations and general and administrative costs 
we believe existing cash and short term investments of million in addition to cash flow from operations is sufficient to fund development costs required for our baltimore restaurant 
any reduction of our cash flow from operations may cause a delay or cancellation of planned future restaurant development 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
we plan to reduce this deficit through cost containment efforts and cash flow from operations 
financing to construct new restaurants may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans  financial condition  and results of operations 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to current shareholders and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents bridge loan on march   and as amended on april   we entered into a note and warrant purchase agreement with certain accredited investors whereby we sold million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated notes and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the principal and accrued interest outstanding under the notes were due and payable upon the closing of any offering of equity securities by our company generating gross proceeds to us of at least million 
for each  issued in notes  we issued to the noteholder three year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an aggregate exercise price per share of  which was equal to of the five day average of the closing price of our common stock during the five trading days prior to the date of issuance 
the bridge loan  including accrued interest  was repaid during june upon completion of the rights offering described below 
the holders of the notes exercised over subscription rights granted in the agreement and purchased  shares or of the total shares sold in the rights offering 
rights offering as part of the note and warrant purchase agreement  we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s to conduct a rights offering with targeted gross proceeds to us of  pursuant to which each of our stockholders received one non transferrable subscription right for every shares of common stock owned on april  each subscription right entitled the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of per share 
the terms of the agreement provided that any shares of common stock that were not subscribed for in the rights offering by existing stockholders were offered to the holders of the notes on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding and at the same subscription price as offered to the holders of subscription rights granted under the rights offering 
we sold  shares of common stock pursuant to the rights offering and received net proceeds of  after deducting  in expenses 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay amounts owed on the notes  and the remaining proceeds are being utilized to fund capital expenditure requirements 
equipment loans as of december   we had five equipment term loans with a lender  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans aggregated million 
the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and require monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  the loans mature between june and june the loans also require us to maintain certain financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of calculated at the end of each calendar year  and we were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of december  credit facility during october  as part of the settlement agreement with ubs  our broker from which we purchased auction rate security instruments  we entered into a line of credit that is secured by the auction rate security instruments held with ubs 
available borrowings under the line of credit are based upon terms specified in the agreement and subject to adjustment by ubs after consideration of various factors 
at december    was outstanding under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are callable by ubs at any time 
the line of credit is classified as short term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the loan expires on june  the cost of the line of credit effectively offsets the interest earned on the auction rate securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the auction rate securities and the settlement agreement

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
in addition  the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
we have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations as defined in the sec final rule no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities that are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
we held auction rate securities with a par value of million which are classified as trading securities at december  historically  due to the auction process that reset interest rates at pre determined calendar intervals  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level under the fair value hierarchy 
since february  events in the credit markets have adversely affected the auction market and auctions for these securities have failed  and  therefore  we were required to determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using valuation models obtained from third parties 
we also elected to apply fair value accounting to the put option received from our broker as the put option acts as an economic hedge against any further price movement in the auction rate securities and enables us to recognize future changes in the fair value of the put option as those changes occur to offset fair value movements in the auction rate securities 
as we rely on unobservable level inputs  which are highly subjective  in determining the fair value of our auction rate security instruments and related put option  the valuations could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value our auction rate security instruments 
the valuation models require numerous assumptions and assessments  including the following i collateralization underlying each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii the creditworthiness of the counterparty  and iv the current illiquidity of the investments 
we determine the fair value of our put option through comparison of the fair value of each auction rate security instrument to its par value and then discount this amount by a rate reflective of the risk of default by the issuer between the valuation date and the expected exercise date of the put option 
these assumptions  assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties  are difficult to predict and require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions  applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
the fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets 

table of contents property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and we select useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we evaluate property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in restaurant operating results indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes in legal factors or in the business climate 
the assessment of impairment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
the recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if indicators of impairment are present and if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the restaurant assets  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
during and  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges for underperforming restaurants 
we continue to monitor the operating performance of each individual restaurant 
we may be required to record impairment charges in the future if certain restaurants perform below expectations 
leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the future minimum lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 

table of contents income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that are deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies  and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may be unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as we update our estimates  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial position  or we could reduce our valuation allowances which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option awards  which requires the use of a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the expected life of the option as we do not have enough history trading as a public company to calculate our own stock price volatility 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
we also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our investments 
we held approximately million in investments  including million of auction rate securities  as of december  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for  the average interest rate earned on our investments was approximately 
a hypothetical basis point decline in the interest rate earned on our investments would decrease our interest income by approximately  primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of commodity costs 
many of the food products purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases
