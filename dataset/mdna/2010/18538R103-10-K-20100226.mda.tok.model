risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  and as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we intend to expand through the building of new facilities or the acquisition of facilities or businesses and may have difficulties integrating these future operations or acquisitions or may not realize anticipated benefits 
our growth strategy involves expanding our consumer products business in both size and geographic reach 
to accomplish this  we may build converting and papermaking facilities  pursue acquisitions of new facilities or businesses  or both 
building new  or acquiring and modifying existing  manufacturing facilities entails numerous risks  including difficulties in completing such projects on time due to construction and permitting issues  financing the project  completing the project within budget and integrating new operations and personnel 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  services and personnel of the acquired business  and personnel turnover 
large construction projects or acquisitions can result in a decrease in our cash or an increase in our indebtedness and also may limit our ability to access additional capital when needed and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
we may be unable to identify suitable building locations or acquisition targets 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from construction projects or acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate  or at all 
any inability by us to integrate and manage any new or acquired facilities or businesses in a timely and efficient manner  any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these projects or acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade  promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
changes in the cost and availability of wood fiber used in production of our products may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
wood fiber  primarily wood chips and sawdust  is the principal raw material used in our pulp and paperboard products 
wood fiber  in the form of pulp  is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our consumer products 
pulp is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of wood fiber markets 
increases in pulp prices could adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers or if these price increases for our products significantly trail the increases in pulp prices 
we do not hedge to manage these risks 
much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process is the by product of lumber mill operations  particularly in idaho 
as a result  the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in the lumber industry 
the significant reduction in home building in and resulted in the closure or curtailment of operations at many lumber mills 
however  overall wood fiber prices for our pulp and paperboard production fell in as a result of a decline in whole log prices due to the effect of the poor housing market on log prices 
the price of wood fiber is expected to remain volatile until the housing market recovers and lumber mill operations increase 
additionally  the supply and price of wood fiber can be negatively affected by weather and other events 
record amounts of rainfall in arkansas had a negative effect on the supply of wood fiber to our cypress bend facility during the fall of the effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects  such as the biomass crop assistance program and american recovery and reinvestment act of  are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations 
if we are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all  our financial results and operations may be materially adversely affected 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents united states and global economic conditions could have adverse affects on the demand for our products and our financial results 
us and global economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results 
recessed economic conditions affect our business in a number of ways  including causing i increased pressure for price concessions from customers  ii declines in domestic and global demand for paperboard  iii shifts in customer purchases that affect the mix of our product sales  iv decreased or low housing starts  which increase our production costs due to lower wood fiber supplies and extend the slump in demand for our wood products  and v financial distress or insolvency for certain customers which could affect our sales volumes or our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from those customers 
increased competition over  and customer demands for  certain products could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
our consumer products compete with well known  branded products  as well as other private label products 
inherent risks in our competitive strategy include whether our products will receive direct and retail customer acceptance  new product offerings by competitors  the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels  and price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  some of our private label competitors have built or announced plans to build new papermaking facilities that will produce tad paper that is then converted to produce high end consumer products that compete with high end branded products 
our consumer products paper machines in idaho do not produce tad paper  and we currently do not produce tad bathroom tissue 
if we are unable to offer our existing customers  or new customers  comparable consumer products and in sufficient quantities  we may lose business  not be able to grow our existing business and be forced to sell lower margin products  all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have in the past and may in the future experience changes in demand for our products 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to adjust to increases and decreases in demand 
if we are unable to implement our business strategies to respond to changes in demand  we may need to limit deliveries of some orders for existing customers  which could harm our reputation and our long term relationships with these customers 
alternatively  if we experience a decrease in demand for certain products  we may incur significant costs in revising our manufacturing plan 
if we are not able to respond to changes in demand for our products in a timely manner  our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the cost of energy and chemicals needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our business 
our manufacturing operations utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas 
energy costs were of our cost of sales in or million 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade  which in turn affects our cost of sales 
for example  our energy expenses were lower in than in we purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand  government regulation  geopolitical events and natural disasters 
to help mitigate the exposure to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  we use firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements  and have taken steps to reduce our energy usage through conservation and increasing our internal energy production at our lewiston  idaho cogeneration facility 
our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage 
any significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 

table of contents we also use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes  including latex and polyethylene  many of which are petroleum based chemicals 
for example  our chemical prices were approximately lower in compared to prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile 
in addition  chemical suppliers that use petroleum based products in the manufacturing of their chemicals may  due to supply shortages and cost increases  ration the amount of chemicals available to us  and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business  if we are able to obtain them at all 
finally  certain specialty chemicals that we purchase are available only from a small number of suppliers 
if any of these suppliers were to cease operations or cease doing business with us  we may be unable to obtain such chemicals at favorable prices  if at all 
cyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flow of our pulp and paperboard business 
our pulp and paperboard business is particularly subject to cyclical market conditions 
we may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand  and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime 
in addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes  production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels 
our results of operations and cash flows may be materially affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness 
we are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders from any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in  our consumer products segment derived approximately of its net sales  and the company derived approximately of total net sales  from three customers 
sales to these three customers have represented nearly of segment net sales in each of the last three fiscal years 
our pulp and paperboard segment sells its products to a large number of customers  although certain customers have historically purchased a significant amount of our pulp or paperboard products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them 
in addition  our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments 
our relationships with our large customers depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products at competitive prices 
if we lose one of these customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them  we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business volume and our operating results and business could be harmed 
in addition  our focus on these large accounts could affect our ability to serve our smaller accounts  particularly when product supply is tight and we are not able to fully satisfy orders for these smaller accounts 
significant competition could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our net sales and profitability 
the markets for our products are highly competitive  and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each market 
some of our competitors have advantages over us  including lower raw material and labor costs 
our consumer products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products 
our consumer products business competes with the branded tissue products producers  such as procter gamble  and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products  such as georgia pacific and kimberly clark 
these companies are far larger than us  have much greater sales  marketing and research and development resources than we do  and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale 
historically  branded tissue producers have not produced private label tissue products 
the greater scope and scale of operations enjoyed at major branded tissue producers would allow them to produce private label tissue at lower costs than we incur 
because of their size and resources  these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents our ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors  including manufacturing capacity  general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes 
our pulp and paperboard business competes with international paper  meadwestvaco  georgia pacific  rock tenn and international producers  most of whom are much larger than us 
any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry  which could cause downward pressure on pricing 
in addition  customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials  such as plastic  for their products 
an increased supply of any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we benefited greatly in from a tax credit that has expired and there are uncertainties related to refundable tax credits that we have received 
we are registered with the internal revenue service  or irs  as an alternative fuel mixer and have received refundable tax credit payments in connection with our use of black liquor  a by product of the pulp manufacturing process  in an alternative fuel mixture to produce energy at our pulp mills 
the amount of the refundable tax credit is equal to per gallon of alternative fuel mixture used 
in  we recorded income of million related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit 
there is relatively little guidance regarding the alternative fuel mixture tax credit and the law governing the issue is complex 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we were qualified to receive the tax credit in  or whether we will be entitled to retain the amounts we received upon further review by the irs 
in addition  while it is our position that payments received or credits taken in relation to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit should not be subject to corporate income tax  there can be no assurance as to whether or not the amounts we have received will be subject to taxation 
increases in our transportation costs or disruptions in our transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business  primarily our consumer products business  is dependent on transportation services to transport our products to our customers and deliver raw materials to us 
in  transportation costs for our business were of our cost of sales 
the costs of these transportation services are affected by the volatility in fuel prices 
we have not been in the past and may not in the future be able to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to our customers 
if we are unable to increase our prices to respond to increased fuel costs charged to us by our transportation providers  our gross margins may be materially adversely affected 
if any of our transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to manufacture our products on a timely basis 
shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions  strikes or other events 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation  negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures  which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  water discharges  air emissions  hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup 
environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues  such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
we are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits 
failure to comply with these laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures  install pollution control equipment  or take other remedial 
table of contents actions  product recalls or labeling changes 
we also may be required to make additional expenditures  which could be significant  relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis 
we also own properties  conduct or have conducted operations at properties  or have assumed indemnity obligations in connection with our spin off from potlatch for properties or operations  where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years  including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary 
consequently  we will continue to be subject to environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the permits we currently hold  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
approximately of our full time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements 
as these agreements expire  we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us 
any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes  lockouts or other labor actions 
any such labor actions  including work slowdowns or stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance 
we regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities 
the machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex  have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis 
we must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
in addition  our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance 
these scheduled shutdowns of our facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which the shutdown occurs 
unexpected production disruptions could also cause us to shut down any of our facilities 
those disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances  including prolonged power outages  mechanical or process failures  shortages of raw materials  natural catastrophes  disruptions in the availability of transportation  labor disputes  terrorism and changes in or non compliance with environmental or safety laws 
any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods  regardless of the reason for the shutdown 
those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks  depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our wood products business is highly sensitive to downturns in the housing market 
our wood products business is a commodity business  which is closely tied to the demand for  and supply of  housing 
the home building industry is influenced by numerous factors  including economic changes nationally and locally  mortgage and other interest rates  consumer confidence  job formation  demographic trends  tax incentives  and the availability of credit 
the current depressed conditions in the housing market resulting from  among other factors  excess unsold home inventory levels and lack of availability of credit for lenders  builders and homebuyers  have materially adversely affected our wood products segment 
a continuing and prolonged downturn in the housing market could have a significant adverse effect on the future results of operations of our wood products segment 
our pension plans are currently underfunded  and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans  reducing cash available for our business 
we have company sponsored pension plans covering our salaried and hourly employees 
the significant decline in the securities markets in and resulting substantial decline in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by the plans caused these pension plans to be underfunded because our projected clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
we are required to make cash contributions to our qualified pension plans for and approximately million plus interest payable by september and approximately million plus interest payable by september and we may be required to make increased annual contributions to our pension plans in future years  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change 
in addition to our pension plans  we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our current and former us salaried and hourly employees 
our retiree health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally  which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years 
our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension costs 
significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows  financial conditions and results of operations 
we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations  and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition 
we use information technology systems in various aspects of our operations  including enterprise resource planning  management of inventories and customer sales 
some of these systems have been in place for long periods of time 
if one of these systems was to fail  or we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems  we may suffer disruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing new systems 
if our spin off from potlatch is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes  we  and our stockholders  could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 
potlatch received a private letter ruling from the irs that its spin off of our company qualifies for tax free treatment under applicable sections of the internal revenue code 
in addition  potlatch received an opinion from tax counsel that the spin off so qualifies 
the irs ruling and the opinion relied on certain representations  assumptions and undertakings  including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business  and neither the irs ruling nor the opinion would be valid if such representations  assumptions and undertakings were incorrect 
moreover  the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the spin off qualifies for tax free treatment 
notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and opinion  the irs could determine that the spin off should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations  assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 
if the spin off fails to qualify for tax free treatment  potlatch would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value  and our initial public stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 
under the tax sharing agreement between potlatch and us  we would generally be required to indemnify potlatch against any tax resulting from the spin off including any tax that would result if potlatch were to fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust  as a result of income recognized by potlatch if the spin off were determined to be taxable to the extent that such tax resulted from an issuance of our equity securities  a redemption of our equity securities or our involvement in other acquisitions of our equity securities  other actions or failures to act by us  or any of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated 
our indemnification obligations to potlatch and its subsidiaries  officers and directors are not limited by any maximum amount 
if we are required to indemnify potlatch or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax sharing agreement  we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

table of contents we must abide by certain restrictions to preserve the tax free treatment of the spin off and may not be able to engage in desirable acquisitions and other strategic transactions following the spin off 
to preserve the tax free treatment of the spin off to potlatch and our stockholders  under the tax sharing agreement that we entered into with potlatch  for the two year period following the distribution  we may be prohibited  except with the consent of potlatch  from issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs if such issuance would represent a or greater interest in us  acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities if such issuance would represent a or greater interest in us  or engaging in mergers or asset transfers that could jeopardize the tax free status of the distribution 
these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include  among other things  the following a classified board of directors with three year staggered terms  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms  including preferences and voting rights  of those shares without stockholder approval  stockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent  advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings  removal of directors only for cause  allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors  and supermajority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors  they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some  or a majority  of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and  in that case  may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
we are also subject to delaware laws that could have similar effects 
one of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with a significant stockholder unless specific conditions are met

overview we were a subsidiary of potlatch corporation  which we refer to as potlatch  until our spin off on december  unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise indicated  references in this report to clearwater paper corporation  we  our  our company and us refer for all periods prior to the spin off  to the consumer products  pulp and paperboard and wood products businesses separated from potlatch in the spin off  and for all periods following the spin off  to clearwater paper corporation 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents business clearwater paper corporation is a leading producer of private label tissue and paperboard products 
our products are primarily pulp based and manufactured in the united states 
our private label tissue products are sold in grocery stores in the united states  and our market bleached paperboard is sold in the high end segment of the packaging industry 
we also manufacture wood products  including appearance grade cedar and dimensional framing lumber products 
we are vertically integrated and produce a significant amount of the pulp required in our tissue and paperboard businesses 
as of december   our business was organized into three reporting segments our consumer products segment manufactures tissue products sold on a private label basis primarily to major grocery store chains 
we operate two tissue mills with related converting facilities in idaho and nevada  and an additional converting facility located in illinois 
the segment s net sales were million in  representing approximately of our net sales  before elimination of intersegment net sales 
intersegment net sales were million in our pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard and bleached softwood pulp 
we operate two pulp and paperboard mills  one located in arkansas and one in idaho 
most of our pulp production is used in the manufacture of our paperboard products or transferred to our consumer products segment for use in the production of tissue products 
the segment s net sales were million in  representing approximately of our net sales  before elimination of intersegment net sales 
intersegment net sales  consisting of the sale of pulp to our consumer products segment  were million in our wood products segment produces dimensional framing lumber and appearance grade cedar products for the building products market at a mill located in idaho 
the wood products segment s net sales were million in  representing approximately of our net sales  before elimination of intersegment net sales 
intersegment net sales  consisting primarily of sales of residual wood fiber used in our pulp making operations  were million in recent development announced expansion plans the company announced on february   our intention to build a tissue converting facility in the southeastern united states as part of our plans to expand our consumer products segment business 
this site is expected to have two initial converting lines  producing both conventional and tad tissue products  and is expected to cost approximately million to build  and is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of our expectation is that approximately of the project cost will be incurred in and the remainder in the first half of simultaneous with the commencement of the construction of the converting facility  the company intends to continue our evaluation of the construction of a tad paper machine and additional converting lines at the same facility site 
the paper machine under consideration would be a high capacity machine that is able to produce approximately  tons annually  or the equivalent of approximately million cases 
this type of machine typically takes about two years to build and generally costs over million excluding land and building costs 
associated with the tad paper machine  we would plan to add five additional converting lines at a total expected cost of approximately million 
highlights alternative fuel mixture tax credit we are registered with the internal revenue service  or irs  as an alternative fuel mixer and have received refundable tax credit payments in connection with our use of black liquor  a by product of the pulp manufacturing process  in an alternative fuel mixture to produce energy at our pulp mills 
the amount of the refundable tax credit is equal to per gallon of alternative fuel mixture used 
the alternative fuel mixture tax credit expired on december  for  we recorded income of million in our financial statements related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit 
through december  we had received payments of million related to the 
table of contents alternative fuel mixture tax credit 
subsequent to december   we have received an additional million of cash related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credits earned in beginning in the third quarter of  we elected not to continue our prior practice of making periodic requests for payments related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit and instead elected to claim the credit on our income tax return 
the amount of credit we recorded since this change that we will claim on our income tax return is million and is included in taxes receivable on our balance sheet 
we believe there is a reasonable basis to exclude the million of alternative fuel mixture tax credits recorded in from taxable income 
however  in accordance with guidance relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we have established a liability of million at december   which is classified as non current accrued taxes on our balance sheet 
liquidity as a result of funds from operations and funds from the receipt of alternative fuel mixture tax credits  our balance sheet and liquidity are currently in a strong position 
at december   we had million of cash and short term investments 
this puts us at a net debt free position  which we believe will enhance our ability to pursue growth opportunities 
components and trends in our business our operating results have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors  including the cyclical nature of the pulp and paperboard industry  competition  the efficiency and level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing operations  changes in our principal expenses such as for wood fiber and energy  and other factors 
net sales prices for our consumer tissue products primarily tend to follow the prices of branded tissue products  although we set our prices based on the best interests of our customer and our company 
demand and pricing for our pulp and paperboard products is largely determined by general global market conditions 
paperboard prices were relatively stable in compared to prior years  while market conditions for pulp  although still weak  improved slightly from early demand for our wood products is largely related to the us housing market  which continues to be in a prolonged downturn 
our businesses experience cyclical market conditions and  as a result  historical prices for our products and sales volumes have been volatile 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand for our products 
product supply in the industries in which we operate is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
capacity in these industries tends to increase during periods when prices remain strong 
in addition  currency exchange rates affect us supplies of paperboard  as us manufacturers are attracted to the us market when the dollar is relatively strong 
our paperboard business  through exports  has benefited significantly from weakness in the us dollar over the past few years 
demand for our products is related to the state of the north american economy in general  as well as  in the case of our paperboard products  the economies of east asia 
the demand for our wood products is affected by the level of new residential construction activity and  to a lesser extent  home repair and remodeling activity  which are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  interest rates  population growth and other factors 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our markets 
in addition  our industry is capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition  particularly during periods of reduced demand 
some of our competitors have lower production costs and  as a result  these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases 
net sales consist of sales of consumer tissue  pulp and paperboard and wood products  net of discounts  returns and allowances and any sales taxes collected 
sales taxes  when collected  are recorded as a current liability until remitted to the appropriate governmental entities

table of contents operating expenses other than labor and maintenance costs  our principal operating expense items are wood fiber  energy  chemicals and transportation 
prices for these items are volatile and directly affect our results of operations 
input costs for several of our larger cost elements  mainly wood fiber  transportation  energy and chemicals  decreased significantly in compared to largely in relation to the overall state of the us and global economies 
as economic conditions improve  we expect at least some upward pressure on these costs 
competitive market conditions can limit our ability to pass cost increases through to our customers 
wood fiber 
our most significant operating expense is the cost of wood fiber needed to supply our manufacturing facilities 
in  fiber costs totaled million  or of our cost of sales 
both wood chips and sawdust are used in the process of making pulp 
we rely on residual wood fibers  such as wood chips and sawdust generated by lumber mill operations and wood chips specifically produced for us by contract wood chipping operations 
prices for this wood fiber can fluctuate greatly 
our average production cost for wood chips and sawdust was approximately per ton in  a decrease of over the approximately per ton in overall lumber production in idaho increased in compared to creating more residual chips and sawdust and decreasing the dependency on higher priced whole log chips 
in  we acquired a significant portion of our wood fiber requirements from potlatch  with the remainder purchased from third parties pursuant to short term contracts and in the spot market 
in connection with the spin off in late  we entered into fiber supply agreements with potlatch for our idaho pulp facility  which will likely cover volumes of wood fiber similar to what we acquired from potlatch in and will continue through these agreements will employ a substantially similar market pricing methodology as reflected in our historical financial statements 
maintenance and repairs 
we regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment 
maintenance and repair costs totaled million  or of our cost of sales in the machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex  have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis 
we perform routine maintenance on our machines and periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
in  equipment maintenance and repair expenses  including labor  were million in our consumer products segment  million in our pulp and paperboard segment and million in our wood products segment 
major equipment maintenance and repair in our pulp and paperboard segment also requires maintenance shutdowns generally lasting up to one week per year at our idaho facility and up to one week approximately every months at our arkansas facility  which increases costs and may reduce net sales in the quarters in which the maintenance shutdowns occur 
periodically  major equipment shutdowns extend beyond one week in duration for large scale maintenance  such as extensive boiler repairs 
major maintenance and repair expense for is expected to be approximately million  with more than of these costs being incurred in the first quarter  as a result of the rescheduling of maintenance work from in addition to ongoing maintenance and repair expenses  we make capital expenditures to increase our operating efficiency and to comply with environmental laws 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
our estimated capital expenditures for are expected to be between million and million  including an estimated million for our southeastern united states expansion 
energy 
energy is another significant manufacturing expense 
we use energy in the form of electricity  hog fuel  steam and natural gas 
our expenses for energy used in our manufacturing processes were of our cost of sales or million in energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade 
in we experienced lower costs than in we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to volatile energy prices through conservation and by increasing our internal electrical production at our cogeneration facility that produces steam and electricity in idaho 
in addition  to help mitigate our exposure to changes in natural gas prices  we have used firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements 
as of december   these contracts covered approximately of our expected average monthly natural gas requirements for the pulp and paperboard and consumer products segments for our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage 
chemicals 
we consume a significant amount of chemicals in the production of pulp and paperboard 
important chemicals we use include polyethylene  starch  sodium chlorate  caustic  latex and specialty 
table of contents process paper chemicals 
our chemical costs totaled million in or of our cost of sales 
many of our chemicals are purchased under long term contracts  which provide more stability than open market purchases 
however  many of these contracts have pricing mechanisms that adjust with published price indices 
transportation 
petroleum prices also impact our operating results 
high fuel prices result in increased transportation costs related to delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities and for the delivery of our finished products to customers 
increasing fuel prices particularly affect our consumer products margins because we supply customers throughout the united states from our tissue mills in idaho and nevada  and we transport bulk  unconverted jumbo tissue rolls  or parent rolls  from our tissue mills in the western us to our illinois tissue converting facility 
transportation costs for our consumer products segment were million in our total transportation costs were million or of our cost of sales for in addition  many of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes  particularly in the pulp making process  are petroleum based and are indirectly impacted by petroleum prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million primarily consist of compensation and associated costs for sales and administrative personnel  as well as commission expenses related to sales of our products 
we expect our selling  general and administrative costs to fluctuate as we continue to properly staff our administrative functions and implement additional cost controls and procedures 
interest expense 
interest expense in primarily includes interest on the million note payable to potlatch in connection with our spin off  prior to the satisfaction of that obligation in june  as well as interest associated with million of senior notes issued by us in june and with our revolving credit facility 
we expect quarterly interest expense in to remain relatively consistent with the amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of unless we modify our debt structure 
income taxes 
income taxes are based on reported earnings and tax rates in the jurisdictions in which our operations occur and offices are located  adjusted for available credits  changes in valuation allowances and differences between reported earnings and taxable income using current tax laws and enacted tax rates 
in  our effective rate was 
critical accounting estimates our accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of net sales  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves forming estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from financial results reported based on management s current estimates 
changes in these estimates are recorded periodically based on updated information 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of our financial statements in item long lived assets 
a significant portion of our total assets are invested in our manufacturing facilities 
also  the cyclical patterns of our businesses cause cash flows to fluctuate by varying degrees from period to period 
as a result  long lived assets are a material component of our financial position with the potential for material change in valuation if assets are determined to be impaired 
we account for impairment of long lived assets in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  regarding impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this guidance requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  as measured by its undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents we use our operational budgets to estimate future cash flows 
budgets are inherently uncertain estimates of future performance due to the fact that all inputs  including net sales  costs and capital spending  are subject to frequent change for many different reasons 
because of the number of variables involved  the interrelationship between the variables and the long term nature of the impairment measurement  sensitivity analysis of individual variables is not practical 
budget estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect changing business conditions  and operations are reviewed  as appropriate  for impairment using the most current data available 
we believe we have adequate support for the carrying value of all of our assets based on anticipated cash flows that will result from our estimates of future demand  pricing  and production costs  assuming certain levels of capital expenditures 
pension and postretirement employee benefits 
the determination of pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the rate of return on plan assets 
for other postretirement employee benefit  or opeb  plans  which provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees  critical assumptions in determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and the assumed health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations 
note to our financial statements includes information for the three years ended december   on the components of pension and opeb expense and the underlying actuarial assumptions used to calculate periodic expense  as well as the funded status for our pension and opeb plans as of december  and the discount rate used in the determination of pension benefit obligations and pension expense is a weighted average benchmark rate based on high quality fixed income investment interest rates 
at december   we calculated obligations using a discount rate 
the discount rates used at december  and were and  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension assets  we employ a process that analyzes historical long term returns for various investment categories  as measured by appropriate indices 
these indices are weighted based upon the extent to which plan assets are invested in the particular categories in arriving at our determination of a composite expected return 
over the past years  the period the pension assets have been actively managed  the actual average annual return on pension plan assets has been approximately  as of december  total periodic pension plan expense in was million 
an increase in the discount rate or the rate of expected return on plan assets  all other assumptions remaining the same  would decrease pension plan expense  and conversely  a decrease in either of these measures would increase plan expense 
as an indication of the sensitivity that pension expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the assumption for expected return on plan assets would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
the actual rates of return on plan assets may vary significantly from the assumptions used because of unanticipated changes in financial markets 
our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded by million at december  and million at december  as a result  we will make contributions of approximately million plus interest to our qualified pension plans for the tax year 
although related to the tax year  payment of these contributions is not required until september we expect our required contributions to be approximately million plus interest to our qualified pension plans for the tax year  payable by september in addition  we estimate contributions will total approximately million in to our non qualified pension plan 
we do not anticipate funding our opeb plans in except to pay benefit costs as incurred during the year by plan participants 
for our opeb plans  expense for was million 
the discount rate used to calculate opeb obligations  which was determined using the same methodology we used for our pension plans  was  and at december   and  respectively 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used to calculate opeb obligations and expense was in  grading to over approximately years 

table of contents as an indication of the sensitivity that opeb expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect plan expense by approximately million 
a change in the assumption for health care cost trend rates would have affected plan expense by approximately to million and the total postretirement employee obligation by approximately to million 
the actual rates of health care cost increases may vary significantly from the assumption used because of unanticipated changes in health care costs 
periodic pension and opeb expenses are included in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations 
the expense is allocated to all business segments 
in accordance with current accounting guidance governing defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  at december  and  long term assets are recorded for overfunded plans and liabilities are recorded for underfunded plans 
the funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation 
for underfunded plans  the estimated liability to be payable in the next twelve months is recorded as a current liability  with the remaining portion recorded as a long term liability 
income taxes 
the conclusion that deferred tax assets are realizable is subject to certain assessments  projections and judgments made by management 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable  the standard we use is whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryforward periods  projected taxable income  and amounts of taxable income we would have generated historically if we had been a stand alone company in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax asset  we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code 
based on existing deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these future deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the company has tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the united states and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
in the preparation of the company s financial statements  management exercises judgments in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and applies the guidance pursuant to uncertain tax positions which employs a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
while actual results could vary  in management s judgment  the company has adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters 
results of operations except for the period from december   through december   when we operated as and were accounted for as a separate public company  our results of operations and financial condition discussed below cover periods prior to the spin off and related transactions 
the historical financial and other data were prepared on a combined basis from potlatch s consolidated financial statements using the historical results of operations and bases of the assets and liabilities of potlatch s consumer products and pulp and paperboard segments and its wood products operations at lewiston  idaho  and give effect to allocations of expenses from potlatch 
our historical financial and other data is not necessarily indicative of our future performance  nor do they necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had we operated as a separate  stand alone entity prior to the spin off 
at december   our business was organized into three reporting segments consumer products  pulp and paperboard  and wood products 
sales or transfers between segments are recorded as intersegment net sales based on prevailing market prices 
in the period to period discussion of our results of operations below  when we discuss our net sales  contributions by each of the segments to our net sales are reported after elimination of intersegment net sales 
in the discussion of business segments sections below  each segment s net sales are presented before elimination of intersegment net sales

as discussed in detail below under discussion of business segments  the decrease in net sales was driven by lower volumes for our paperboard products which were partially offset by modest price increases 
our lumber and pulp shipments to external parties increased in but were more than offset by lower prices 
our consumer products volumes and prices were both up from cost of sales cost of sales was and of net sales  respectively  for the years ended december  and the decrease of million  or  from to was primarily due to two factors 
wood fiber costs dropped overall as the price of logs declined significantly due to the poor housing market 
petroleum costs and petroleum based product costs also declined due to the general economic decline  which resulted in lower natural gas prices  lower transportation costs and a reduction in the costs of petroleum based chemicals used in our production processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher annual incentive based compensation related expenses and the costs associated with additional director fees recorded in as a result of an increase in the value of equity based awards 
the increase is also due to additional corporate administration expenses associated with being a new  independent  publicly traded company  such as audit fees  relocation costs and consulting costs associated with hiring new executives and the consolidation of our corporate functions in a new headquarters 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were favorably affected by approximately million of income from legal settlements 
alternative fuel mixture tax credit in  we recorded million of pre tax income related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit for the period from late january through december interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million  or in compared to interest expense on the note payable to potlatch was million in  compared to million in as discussed previously  in june we issued million of senior notes and used a portion of the proceeds to satisfy our million note payable obligation to potlatch 
interest expense on the million senior notes was million in in  we also incurred approximately million of interest expense related to our credit facility 
partially offsetting the interest expense was million in interest income we recorded in 
table of contents debt retirement costs we recorded approximately million of expenses in associated with the retirement of our million note payable obligation to potlatch 
the million note payable represented the principal amount of credit sensitive debentures originally issued by an affiliate of potlatch 
prior to our spin off  we agreed to retain the obligation to pay all amounts due to the holders of these debentures 
the million expense represented the remaining interest obligation due to holders of the debentures on december   the maturity date of the credit sensitive debentures 
income tax provision our income tax provision increased million in compared to  primarily due to increased operating earnings 
the recognition of federal renewable energy tax credits of million partially offset the higher income tax provision 
excluding the renewable energy tax credits  the effective tax rate was for  compared to an effective tax rate of for the tax provision for was calculated primarily on a carve out accounting basis since our businesses were part of potlatch for the majority of that period  whereas the tax provision is reflective of the company s operations and tax attributes as a stand alone entity

cash used for financing activities in and primarily consisted of net payments to potlatch in accordance with potlatch s centralized approach to cash management prior to the spin off 
partially offsetting the net payments to potlatch in were increases in notes and other short term payables totaling million  which included million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility outstanding at december  
table of contents capital resources against the backdrop of a slowly recovering economy  as well as the competitive and cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate  there is uncertainty regarding the amount of cash flows we will generate during the next months 
however  we believe that our cash flows from operations as well as our cash  short term investments and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash required to support our ongoing operations  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the next months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we make substantial capital expenditures or consummate an acquisition  our debt service requirements could increase 
we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
at december   our financial position included debt of million  compared to the balance of million at december   including million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
stockholders equity at december   was million  compared to the december   balance of million 
the ratio of debt to stockholders equity was to at december   compared to to at december  debt arrangements on june   we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the notes are due on june   have an interest rate of and were issued at a price equal to of their face value 
the issuance of these notes generated net proceeds of approximately million after deducting discounts and offering expenses 
we transferred approximately million of these proceeds to a trustee in satisfaction of our obligation related to the indenture under which million principal amount of credit sensitive debentures due december   were originally issued by an affiliate of potlatch 
the obligation to repay the credit sensitive debentures and all interest through maturity was retained by us prior to the spin off 
the million consisted of the million principal amount underlying the credit sensitive debentures  plus approximately million recorded as debt retirement costs on our statement of operations representing our interest obligation due to holders of the debentures on december   plus approximately million included as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
the million of restricted cash represented the difference between our current estimate of the interest payment due to holders of the debentures on december   and the interest payment that would be owed on december   if the maximum interest rate applicable to the credit sensitive debentures were to apply 
the million was returned to us during the fourth quarter of after payment of the million principal amount and accrued interest on december   and thus is no longer included as restricted cash as of december  the senior notes due are general unsecured obligations and are therefore not secured by our assets 
they are equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness  including borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility  which is secured by all accounts receivable  inventory and cash 
the notes are unconditionally guaranteed by any future restricted subsidiary guarantors 
prior to june   we may redeem  at any time at our option  up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with the net proceeds of qualified equity offerings at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time prior to june  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus a premium and accrued and unpaid interest 
the terms of the notes limit our ability and the ability of any restricted subsidiaries to borrow money  pay dividends  redeem or repurchase capital stock  make investments  sell assets  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from any restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and lease back transactions  create liens  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets

table of contents our expected debt service obligation  consisting of cash payments for interest related to our senior notes  is estimated to be approximately million for credit arrangements on november   we entered into a four year million revolving credit facility with certain financial institutions 
the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable plus approximately of our eligible inventory  or million  in each case less a million borrowing capacity reserve 
subject to certain conditions and agreement by the lenders  the million borrowing capacity reserve may be made available for borrowing 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  but approximately million of the credit facility was being used to support outstanding standby letters of credit 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus between and for libor loans  and a base rate effectively equal to the agent bank s prime rate plus between and for other loans 
the percentage margin on all loans is based on our fixed charge coverage ratio for the last twelve months  which is recalculated on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we would have been permitted to draw million under the credit facility at libor plus 
a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is the only financial covenant requirement under our credit facility and is triggered when an event of default exists or when availability falls below  at which time the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio must be at least to as of december   the fixed charge coverage ratio for the last twelve months was to our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by all accounts receivable  inventory and cash 
the credit facility agreement contains various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to  among other things pay dividends or repurchase equity interests from our stockholders  create  incur or guarantee certain debt  incur liens on certain properties  make capital expenditures in amounts in excess of those permitted under the revolving credit agreement  enter into certain affiliate transactions  enter into certain hedging arrangements  and consolidate with or merge with another entity 
shelf registration on january   we filed a registration statement on form s to register up to an aggregate of million of debt and equity securities  which is designed to allow us to issue such securities in the future should we elect to do so 
this shelf was put in place as part of our overall capital structure planning strategy and could be used  among other things  to allow us to pursue growth opportunities should they arise

off balance sheet arrangements we currently are not a party to off balance sheet arrangements that would require disclosure under this section 
environmental our operating facilities are subject to rigorous federal and state environmental regulation governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management 
we endeavor to comply with all environmental regulations and regularly monitor our activities to ensure compliance 
compliance with environmental regulations is a significant factor in our business and requires capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs 
capital expenditures specifically designated for environmental compliance totaled million during and are expected to be million in our pulp mill in idaho discharges treated mill effluent into the nearby snake river 
federal law requires that we comply with provisions of a national pollution discharge elimination system  or npdes  permit 
in march  the environmental protection agency  or epa  issued the current npdes permit for the idaho pulp mill 
the npdes permit requires  among other matters  a significant reduction in biochemical oxygen demand over the five year period of the permit and also requires a reduction in the temperature of the effluent during the months of june through november each year 
we have completed physical modifications to the effluent system to meet the requirements of this permit 
we have requested and anticipate that the clearwater paper corporation form k 
table of contents epa will modify the biological oxygen demand permit limits based on new information 
the epa is processing that permit modification at this time and we expect it will be finalized in the first half of once finalized  we believe the permit modification will result in lower treatment costs for the facility 
the current npdes permit expires on april   and will thereafter be subject to a renewal process by the epa 
our idaho facility uses an off site landfill for disposing of ash and solid waste 
primary clarifier sludge is burned as a fuel in a boiler on site 
our arkansas facility has an on site industrial landfill for disposal of sludge  lime and recausticizing process solids 
this landfill has an estimated remaining life of approximately years 
the mill complies with an npdes permit that was renewed in our idaho and arkansas facilities are both environmental protection agency cluster rule compliant 
the epa has developed maximum achievable control technology  or mact  standards for air emissions from pulp and paper facilities 
we have complied with the applicable mact standards 
our consumer products segment s manufacturing operations routinely produce air emissions  water discharges and solid waste  all of which are managed in accordance with federal and state environmental laws and regulations 
our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we cannot be certain  however  that situations that may give rise to material environmental liabilities will not be discovered or that the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations will not require significant expenditures by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risks on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under that facility 
the interest rates applied to borrowings under the credit facility are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
for example  a increase or decrease in interest rates  based on assumed outstanding credit facility borrowings of million  would have a million annual effect on interest expense 
we currently do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short term interest rate fluctuations on our credit facility borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts for a portion of our natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
as of december   these contracts covered approximately of our expected average monthly natural gas requirements for the pulp and paperboard and consumer products segments for virtually all of our non us sales are denominated in non us dollars and accordingly we are not subject to currency exchange risks associated with the receipt of payments in foreign currencies
