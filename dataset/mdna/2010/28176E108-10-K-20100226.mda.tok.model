critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any impairments of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product  provided that an agreement of sale exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 

table of contents the company s sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry  with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer  limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for rebates  returns and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
the company s primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the company s united states distributors and represents the difference between the company s sales price to the distributor at the company s distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer 
this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor s accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor 
the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from the largest distributors 
this customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates 
the company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 
the company also offers volume rebates to certain gpos and customers based upon target sales levels 
these volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo 
the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid 
the company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 
product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt 
an allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
a write down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete  nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  is damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks 
these 
table of contents capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark 
such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill  the company completes a two step goodwill impairment test 
the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
in  and  the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
additionally  management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit  and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term  strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development 
certain of these investments are designated as available for sale 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting  as appropriate 
the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations  whereby the company owns a minimum of of the investee s outstanding voting stock  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded at the amount of the company s investment and adjusted each period for the company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid 
as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value  the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment s fair value 
when the fair value of an available for sale investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a recognized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee s performance against product development milestones  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values 
stock based awards consist of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions 
the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions  including stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected option term 
stock based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be impacted 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the company uses various valuation approaches  including market  income and or cost approaches  and considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the company prioritizes the inputs used to determine fair value in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets  that are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 

table of contents when possible  the company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities 
when identical assets or liabilities are not traded in active markets  the company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  the company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement 
the company has procedures to independently verify and test valuations received from third parties 
the financial assets and liabilities that the company records at fair value include investments in marketable securities  residual interests in securitizations and derivative instruments 
investments in marketable securities investments held for the executive deferred compensation plan the company holds investments in trading securities related to its executive deferred compensation plan 
the fair values of the securities are based on quoted market prices and are categorized as level investments in unconsolidated affiliates certain of the company s investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available for sale 
these investments are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices and are categorized as level derivative instruments the company uses forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to forecasted intercompany and third party foreign currency transactions 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value for derivatives is determined based on indicative mid market data levels for spot rate and forward points as of the close of business on december  all values are discounted to present from the expiry date 
the values of options are calculated based on the forward implied volatilities to the expiry date 
the models used for valuations are based upon well recognized financial principles  and the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources 
although readily observable data is used in the valuations  different valuation methodologies could have an effect on the estimated fair value 
the derivative instruments are categorized as level new accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
this accounting guidance eliminates the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities and establishes a new approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether the entity a has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and b has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary  and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about an enterprise s involvement in a vie 
the guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to asc topic  revenue recognition  to require companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on estimated selling price in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for the deliverables 
asc topic was also amended to eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements 
table of contents must have objective and reliable evidence of fair value before a company can recognize the portion of the overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that have already been delivered 
the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment to asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  to require companies to a disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for such transfers and b present separately in the level reconciliation information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the amendment also clarifies existing guidance on the level of disaggregation to present and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level reconciliation  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
edwards lifesciences maintains an overall risk management strategy that utilizes a variety of interest rate and currency derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the derivative instruments used include option based products and forward currency contracts 
the company does not use any of these instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amounts of the company s derivative financial instruments at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts of option based products and forward currency contracts do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the company s exposure through its use of derivatives 
interest rate risk as part of its overall risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings and changes in fair values to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately of the company s weighted average interest rate affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives and investments  would have an immaterial effect on the company s annual interest expense 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net united states dollar cash inflows resulting from transactions with foreign customers and suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manages these risks utilizing various types of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated  but not yet committed  sales expected to be denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company hedges certain of its net investments in international affiliates 
such contracts hedge the united states dollar value of foreign currency denominated net assets from the effects of volatility in currency exchange rates by creating debt denominated in the respective currencies of the underlying net assets 
any changes in the carrying value of 
table of contents these net investments that are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates are offset by changes in the carrying value of the foreign currency denominated debt that are a result of the same fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as part of the strategy to manage risk while minimizing hedging costs  the company utilizes both foreign currency forward exchange contracts and option based products in managing its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
option based products consist of purchased put options and  at times  written sold call options to create collars 
option based products are agreements that either grant the company the right to receive  or require the company to make payments at  specified currency rate levels 
as part of its risk management process  the company uses a value at risk var methodology in connection with other management tools to assess and manage its foreign currency financial instruments and measure any potential loss in earnings as a result of adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation  with a percent confidence level and a day holding period  to estimate this potential loss 
the company s calculated var at december  and with a maturity of up to one year  was million and million  respectively 
this amount excludes the potential effects of any changes in the value of the underlying transactions or balances 
the company s calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on its portfolio of financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur 
actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods 
in addition  the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse  which may not be the case 
any loss incurred on the financial instruments is expected to be offset by the effects of currency movements on the hedging of all exposures  there may be currency exchange rate gains or losses in the future 
credit risk derivative financial instruments used by the company involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in the event a counterparty should default  and market risk as the instruments are subject to rate and price fluctuations 
credit risk is managed through the use of credit standard guidelines  counterparty diversification  monitoring of counterparty financial condition and master netting agreements in place with all derivative counterparties 
credit exposure of derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value effects of contracts with a positive fair value at december  reduced by the effects of master netting agreements 
additionally  at december   all derivative financial instruments were with commercial banks and investment banking firms assigned investment grade ratings of a or better by national rating agencies 
the company does not anticipate non performance by its counterparties and has no reserves related to non performance as of december  the company has not experienced any counterparty default since its inception in april concentrations of credit risk in the normal course of business  edwards lifesciences provides credit to customers in the healthcare industry  performs credit evaluations of these customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses 
in  the company had no customers that represent greater than of its total net sales or accounts receivable  net
