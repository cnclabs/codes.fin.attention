executive overview net income attributable to amerigas partners for fiscal was million compared with net income attributable to amerigas partners for fiscal of million 
net income attributable to amerigas partners in fiscal reflects the negative impact of a million loss on the discontinuance of interest rate hedges recorded in march while net income attributable to amerigas partners in fiscal reflects the benefit of a million gain on the sale of the partnership s california lpg storage terminal 
average temperatures in the partnership s service territories were slightly warmer than normal in both fiscal and fiscal retail volumes sold were approximately lower in fiscal reflecting the lingering effects of the economic recession  customer conservation and customer attrition partially offset by volumes acquired through acquisitions

fiscal data has been adjusted to correct a noaa error 

table of contents based upon heating degree day data  average temperatures in our service territories during fiscal were warmer than normal compared with temperatures in the prior year that were warmer than normal 
fiscal retail gallons sold were lower than fiscal reflecting  among other things  the adverse effects of the significant deterioration in general economic activity which occurred over the last year and continued customer conservation 
during fiscal  average wholesale propane commodity prices at mont belvieu  texas  one of the major supply points in the us  were more than lower than such prices in fiscal the decrease in the average wholesale commodity prices in fiscal reflects the effects of a precipitous decline in commodity propane prices principally during the first quarter of fiscal following a substantial increase in prices during most of the second half of fiscal although wholesale propane prices in fiscal rebounded modestly from prices experienced earlier in the year  at september  such prices remained approximately lower than at september  retail propane revenues declined million in fiscal reflecting a decrease as a result of the lower retail volumes sold million and a decrease due to lower average selling prices million 
wholesale propane revenues declined million reflecting a decrease from lower wholesale selling prices million partially offset by an increase from higher wholesale volumes sold million 
total cost of sales decreased million to  million principally reflecting the effects of the previously mentioned lower propane commodity prices 
total margin was million greater in fiscal reflecting the beneficial impact of higher than normal retail unit margins resulting from the previously mentioned rapid decline in propane commodity costs that occurred primarily as we entered the critical winter heating season in the first quarter of fiscal the million increase in fiscal partnership ebitda reflects the effects of a pre tax gain from the november sale of the partnership s california lpg storage facility million and the previously mentioned increase in total margin million 
these increases were partially offset by slightly higher operating and administrative expenses million and slightly lower other income million 
the slightly higher operating and administrative expenses reflects  in large part  an increase in compensation and benefit expenses million and higher costs associated with facility maintenance projects million offset principally by lower vehicle fuel expenses million due to lower propane  diesel and gasoline prices 
operating income increased million in fiscal reflecting the previously mentioned increase in ebitda million partially offset by slightly higher depreciation and amortization expense million reflecting acquisitions and plant and equipment expenditures made since the prior year 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million including current maturities of long term debt of million and bank loans of million 
the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million including current maturities of long term debt of million and no bank loans outstanding 
total debt outstanding at september  includes long term debt comprising million of amerigas partners senior notes and million of other long term debt 
in july  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes with borrowings under its revolving credit facility and cash from operations as described below 

table of contents amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
in order to meet its short term cash needs  amerigas olp has a million unsecured credit agreement credit agreement which expires on october  amerigas olp also has a million unsecured revolving credit facility supplemental credit agreement which expires on june  amerigas olp expects to renew these credit agreements prior to their expiration 
amerigas olp s credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  for working capital and general purposes 
the supplemental credit agreement permits amerigas olp to borrow up to million for working capital and general purposes 
at september   there were million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and no amounts outstanding under the supplemental credit agreement 
the average interest rate on credit agreement borrowings outstanding at september  was 
there were no borrowings under the amerigas olp s credit agreements at september  borrowings under our credit agreements are classified as bank loans on the consolidated balance sheets 
issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  and million at september  the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the higher peak bank loan borrowings in fiscal resulted from amounts borrowed to fund counterparty cash collateral obligations associated with derivative financial instruments used by the partnership to manage price risk associated with fixed sales price commitments to customers 
these collateral obligations resulted from the precipitous decline in propane commodity prices that occurred early in fiscal at september   the partnership s available borrowing capacity under the credit agreements was million 
based on existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  and borrowings available under amerigas olp s credit agreement and the supplemental credit agreement  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs during fiscal for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the fourth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
the general partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business and for distributions during the next four quarters 
in addition  certain of the partnership s debt agreements require reserves be established for the payment of debt principal and interest 
distributions of available cash are made to limited partners and to the general partner giving effect to the interest of the general partner in distributions of available cash from amerigas olp to amerigas partners until available cash exceeds the minimum quarterly distribution of and the first target distribution of per common unit or a total of per common unit 
when available cash exceeds per common unit in any quarter  the general partner will receive a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution but only with respect to the amount by which the distribution per common unit to limited partners exceeds 

table of contents quarterly distributions of available cash per limited partner unit paid during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were as follows fiscal st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter the partnership has made quarterly distributions to common unitholders in excess of per limited partner unit since the quarterly distribution paid may  as a result  beginning with the quarterly distribution paid may  and every quarter thereafter  the general partner has received a greater percentage of the total partnership distributions than its aggregate general partner interests in amerigas olp and amerigas partners 
the general partner distribution based on its aggregate general partner ownership interests totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in these amounts are incentive distributions received by the general partner during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of million  million and million  respectively 
on july   the general partner s board of directors approved a distribution of per common unit payable on august  to unitholders of record on august  this distribution included the regular quarterly distribution of per common unit and per common unit reflecting a one time distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s sale of its california storage facility in november cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership may use its credit agreements to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
due in large part to declining propane commodity prices  fiscal cash flows from operations were significantly greater than in fiscal or fiscal primarily the result of lower cash required to fund changes in working capital as further described below 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided used to fund changes in operating working capital totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the higher cash needed to fund changes in working capital in fiscal resulted from the greater cash needed to fund changes in operating working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  due to the year over year increase in wholesale propane product prices 
the greater cash provided by changes in operating working capital in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects lower net cash required to fund changes in accounts receivable and inventories due in large part to the effects of declining wholesale propane product costs during the year 
cash flow from changes in operating working capital in fiscal also reflects reimbursements of million of counterparty collateral deposits paid in fiscal investing activities 
investing activity cash flow is principally affected by expenditures for property  plant and equipment  cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and proceeds from sales of assets 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  and million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal the greater capital expenditures in fiscal and include expenditures associated with an ongoing system software replacement 
in november  the partnership sold its california  barrel lpg storage facility for net cash proceeds of million 

table of contents financing activities 
changes in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to distributions on amerigas partners common units  issuances and repayments of long term debt  borrowings under credit agreements  and issuances of amerigas partners common units 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal distributions in fiscal include an additional per common unit to distribute a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s november sales of its california storage facility

during fiscal  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes using cash generated from operations 
capital expenditures in the following table  we present capital expenditures which exclude acquisitions for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we also provide amounts we expect to spend in fiscal we expect to finance fiscal capital expenditures principally from cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreements 
year ended september  millions of dollars estimate property  plant and equipment fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures include expenditures associated with a partnership system software replacement 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations  capital expenditures and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and millions of dollars total therafter long term debt a interest on long term fixed rate debt b operating leases propane supply contracts other purchase obligations c total a based upon stated maturity dates 
b based upon stated interest rates 
c includes material capital expenditure obligations 
the components of other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet at september  principally consist of property and casualty liabilities and  to a much lesser extent  liabilities associated with executive compensation plans and employee post employment benefit programs 
these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual cash obligations and commitments because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount 

table of contents partnership sale of california storage facility on november   amerigas olp sold its  barrel refrigerated  above ground storage facility located on leased property in california 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million associated with this transaction  which increased net income attributable to amerigas partners for the year ended september  by million 
related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement and a management services agreement among aeh  the general partner of eagle olp  and the general partner  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner monthly for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
the allocation of indirect ugi corporate expenses to the partnership utilizes a weighted  three component formula based on the relative percentage of the partnership s revenues  operating expenses and net assets employed to the total of such items for all ugi operating subsidiaries for which general and administrative services are provided 
the general partner believes that this allocation method is reasonable and equitable to the partnership 
such corporate expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space  stop loss medical coverage and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
the costs related to these items totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal amerigas olp purchases propane from atlantic energy  inc atlantic energy a former subsidiary of ugi energy services  inc energy services and a second tier subsidiary of ugi  pursuant to a propane sales agreement product sales agreement whereby atlantic energy has agreed to sell and amerigas olp has agreed to purchase a specified amount of propane annually at a terminal located in chesapeake  virginia 
the product sales agreement  which was originally scheduled to terminate on april   was amended to extend the initial termination date to april  and to provide for an option to extend beyond that date for an additional five years 
the price to be paid for product purchased under the agreement is determined annually using a contractual formula that takes into account published index prices and the locational value of deliveries at the terminal 
on july   energy services sold its interest in atlantic energy 
in addition  from time to time  amerigas olp purchases propane on an as needed basis from energy services 
the price of the purchases are generally based on market price at the time of purchase 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from energy services and atlantic energy through the date of its sale totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the sale of the terminal did not effect the terms of the product sales agreement 
on october   amerigas olp acquired all of the assets of penn fuel propane  llc now named ugi central penn propane  llc  cpp from cpp  a second tier subsidiary of ugi utilities  inc  for million cash plus estimated working capital of million

pursuant to the acquisition agreement  in february  amerigas olp reached an agreement with ugi utilities on the working capital adjustment pursuant to which ugi utilities reimbursed amerigas olp million plus interest 
the partnership also sells propane to other affiliates of ugi 
such amounts were not material in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
commodity price risk the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and the partnership generally passes on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
these derivative financial instruments contain collateral provisions 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of unsettled commodity price risk sensitive instruments at september  and were gains of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of propane would result in a decrease in fair value of million and million  respectively 
because the partnership s propane derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under gaap  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane market price risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated anticipated transactions 
interest rate risk the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreements 
these agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september   there was million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements 
based upon the average level of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements in fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
as previously mentioned  during the three months ended march   the partnership s management determined that it was likely that it would not issue million of long term debt during the summer of due to the partnership s strong cash flow and anticipated extension of all or a portion of the supplemental credit agreement 
as a result  the partnership discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment for interest rate protection agreements associated with this previously anticipated million long term debt issuance and recorded a million loss which is reflected in other income  net  on the fiscal consolidated statements of operations 
there were no unsettled interest rate protection agreements outstanding at september  the fair value of unsettled interest rate protection agreements at september  was a loss of million 

table of contents derivative financial instruments credit risk the partnership is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
our counterparties principally consist of major energy companies and major us financial institutions 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk 
these policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition  including their credit ratings  and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits 
certain of these agreements call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the partnership in the form of letters of credit  parental guarantees or cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals and environmental liabilities 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present 
in accordance with gaap  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled million 
depreciation expense of million was recorded during fiscal purchase price allocation 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment 
estimates most commonly impact property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation 
newly adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of accounting guidance we adopted in fiscal
