item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview geomet  inc is an independent energy company primarily engaged in the exploration for and development and production of natural gas from coal seams coalbed methane or cbm and non conventional shallow gas 
we were originally founded as a consulting company to the coalbed methane industry in and have been active as an operator and developer of coalbed methane properties since our principal operations and producing properties are located in the cahaba basin in alabama and the central appalachian basin in west virginia and virginia 
we also control additional coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights  principally in alabama  british columbia  virginia  and west virginia 
as of december   we control a total of approximately  net acres of coalbed methane and oil and gas development rights 
we primarily explore for  develop  and produce cbm and non conventional shallow gas 
our objective is to create the premier non conventional shallow gas company in north america emphasizing coalbed methane while maximizing stockholder value through the efficient investment of capital to increase reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
we believe that substantial expertise and experience is required to develop  produce  and operate coalbed methane and non conventional shallow gas fields in an efficient manner 
we believe that the inherent geologic and production characteristics of coalbed methane and non conventional shallow gas offer certain operational advantages compared to conventional gas production 
on march   we executed commitment letters with ngp capital resources company  or ngpc  and north shore energy  llc  which we refer to as north shore  an affiliate of our largest stockholder  whereby ngpc and north shore have agreed to the preliminary terms of a commitment to purchase up to million each million in the aggregate of the company s convertible preferred stock in the event that a proposed rights offering of the convertible preferred stock is not fully subscribed by our common stockholders 
under the terms of the proposed million rights offering  we would distribute  at no charge to the holders of our common stock  rights to purchase up to an aggregate of  new shares of convertible preferred stock at a subscription price of per share 
the number of rights to be distributed per share of common stock would be determined after our board of directors approves and sets a record date for the rights offering 
any rights offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus to our effective registration statement on form s registration no 

in the event that we are able to complete the proposed rights offering  we intend to use the net proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in completing the proposed rights offering on the terms outlined above  and any discussion of the proposed rights offering in this filing on form k does not constitute an offer or the solicitation of an offer of the company s securities 
our board of directors approved the execution of the commitment letters after its receipt of a recommendation to do so by a special committee comprised of two independent directors with no affiliation with our largest stockholder 
the special committee retained the services of independent legal counsel and a financial advisor in evaluating and formulating its recommendation to the board 
effective march   the parties to the revolving credit facility agreement unanimously approved the third amendment to the revolving credit facility third amendment as summarized below the maturity date of the revolving credit facility was extended four months to may  pursuant to a request by the company 
pursuant to a request by the company  the borrowing base was reduced to million and the bank group agreed that the next borrowing determination would be as of june   and the bank group agreed not to call for a determination of the borrowing base prior to that date 

table of contents the minimum current ratio  adjusted for unrealized gains losses on derivative contracts and borrowing availability under the revolving credit agreement  is adjusted to 
to solely for the quarter ended march  the outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility will bear interest at the company s option of either a the bank s adjusted base rate  which is the greatest of i the bank s base rate  ii the federal funds rate plus  or iii the one month libor rate plus  plus a margin of  or b the adjusted libor rate  plus a margin of 
we currently have limited borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility  which matures on may  and we have no assurances that our lenders will extend the maturity date 
accordingly  we will continue to explore various alternatives for additional financing for the company in order to reduce our debt and provide additional capital for growth 
these alternatives may include private or public offerings of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets 
the terms  timing and structure of any such financing or sale will depend on several factors  including market conditions  execution risk  timing  possible dilution of existing shareholders and relative cost of the various financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing or complete an asset sale on terms favorable to us  or at all 
our ability to successfully leverage our competitive strengths and execute our strategy depends upon many factors and is subject to a variety of risks 
for example  our ability to drill on our properties and fund our capital budgets depends  to a large extent  upon our ability to generate cash flow from operations at or above current levels and maintain borrowing capacity at or near current levels under our revolving credit facility  or the availability of future debt and equity financing at attractive prices 
changes in natural gas prices affect both our cash flows and the value of our proved natural gas reserves or our ability to replace production through drilling activities 
many other factors beyond our control  including a material adverse change in our proved natural gas reserves due to factors other than gas pricing changes  our ability to transport our gas to markets  a change in drilling costs  lower than expected production rates  and other factors may adversely affect our ability to fund our anticipated capital expenditures  pursue property acquisitions  and compete for qualified personnel 
impact of current credit market conditions and decreasing natural gas prices changes in natural gas prices significantly affect our revenues  financial condition  cash flows  natural gas reserves and borrowing capacity 
markets for natural gas have historically been volatile and we expect this trend to continue 
prices for natural gas may fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond our control 
we are unable to accurately predict the prices we will receive for our natural gas 
accordingly  any significant or sustained declines in natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  operating results  liquidity and ability to obtain financing 
declining or prolonged low natural gas prices may also result in non compliance with the covenants in our revolving credit facility agreement and could result in a lower determination of our borrowing base 
although we intend to cure any non compliance with covenants in our revolving credit facility in the event they occur  no assurance can be given that we will be able to cure such non compliance 
lower natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
further declines in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and estimated quantities of our proved natural gas reserves  our ability to fund our operations and our financial condition  cash flow  results of operations and access to capital 
our capital expenditure budgets are highly dependent on future natural gas prices 

table of contents proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month  adjusted for regional price differentials  for the month period ended december  the average henry hub spot market price was per mcf  resulting in a natural gas price of per mcf when adjusted for regional price differentials 
impairments recorded to gas properties for the year ended december   were united states canada total impairment of gas properties deferred income tax benefit impairment of gas properties  net of tax impairments recorded solely due to the new sec rules that became effective december   and are included above were united states canada total impairment of gas properties deferred income tax benefit impairment of gas properties  net of tax the natural gas price used in the valuation of natural gas reserves as of december  was per mcf henry hub spot market price for december   adjusted for regional price differentials 
impairments recorded to gas properties for the year ended december   were united states canada total impairment of gas properties deferred income tax benefit impairment of gas properties  net of tax holding all factors constant other than natural gas prices  a and decline in the prices used at december  would have resulted in an additional ceiling test impairment of approximately million and million  respectively  of our full cost pool 
we believe that we are taking the necessary actions to position ourselves to continue operations in the current credit and commodity market environment with premium natural gas pricing due to the geographic location of our properties  natural gas hedges  and long lived reserves with shallow annual production decline rates 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget for from our operating cash flows 
if our cash flows are not sufficient to fund all of our planned capital projects  we expect to reduce our capital budget accordingly 
the amount and timing of our expenditures are subject to change based upon market conditions  results of operations and other factors 
we routinely adjust our capital expenditure budget in response to changes in natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  cash flow  drilling results and borrowing base redeterminations under our revolving credit facility 
decrease in proved reserves our proved natural gas reserves as of december   as estimated by degolyer and macnaughton d m  independent petroleum engineers  totaled approximately bcf  a decrease of approximately  after production  from the approximate bcf of proved natural gas reserves at september   as audited by d m  and a decrease  after production  of from the approximate bcf of proved natural gas reserves at december  proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month  adjusted for regional price differentials  for the month period ended december  the average henry hub spot market price was per mcf  resulting in a natural gas price of per mcf when adjusted for regional price differentials 
all prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with the amended sec guidelines which were effective for financial statements for 
table of contents periods ending on or after december  the natural gas price used in the valuation of natural gas reserves as of september  was per mcf per mcf market price for october   adjusted for regional price differentials  and as of december  was per mcf per mcf henry hub spot market price for december   adjusted for regional price differentials 
our proved reserves were from coalbed methane reservoirs and were developed 
approximately of total year end proved reserves are in the pond creek and lasher fields in west virginia and virginia and are in the gurnee field in alabama 
the present value of proved reserves discounted at ten percent was approximately million at december  as compared to million at year end downward revisions  due in large part to under performance in the gurnee field  totaled approximately bcf  of which bcf were revisions reported as of september  in our filing on form q 
our proved reserves at december  were also impacted by lower natural gas prices and costs in we were able to limit the effect of lower natural gas prices through our ongoing cost reduction strategy  which we implemented in april natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas and assumptions concerning future natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs 
coalbed methane producing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by an initial period of inclining production rates as pressure in the reservoir decreases  followed by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
these decline rates  however  are commonly lower than what is generally experienced with non coalbed methane wells 
initial estimates of future production in the gurnee field were generally consistent with comparable coalbed methane producing natural gas reservoirs in the adjacent black warrior basin  which produces from the same pottsville coal formations directly across an anticline 
however  the actual performance of our wells in the gurnee field has not demonstrated the characteristic initial inclining production rates common to coalbed methane reservoirs 
d m lowered estimates of future production in the gurnee field in connection with the preparation of its reports on our proved reserves as of december  and december  now that the portion of the field east of the cahaba river is substantially developed  and based upon continued monitoring of production results of our wells there  we concluded that actual production results did not support  with reasonable certainty  prior estimates of future production for the gurnee field 
consequently  effective september   we further reduced estimates of future production  eliminating all projected inclines in current production rates other than those wells that have clearly demonstrated actual inclines in production and have projected future production rates based on the current production performance of individual wells in the field 
trends our business is influenced by trends that affect the natural gas industry 
in particular  declines in natural gas prices and recent economic trends have adversely affected our business  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
beginning in early  we began implementing countermeasures in response to the above referenced trends in order to enhance our ability to execute our business strategy 
these countermeasures included reducing costs  increasing hedging to reduce exposure to volatile natural gas prices and limiting capital spending 
we are evaluating additional measures in light of the current credit and commodity markets include selling assets  entering into joint venture agreements with industry partners to reduce our capital outlays  or alternate forms of financing 
the natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we have made  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of natural gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with internally generated cash from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and industry joint venture arrangements 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including proved reserves  production from existing wells  the sales prices for natural gas  our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves  and events occurring within the global capital markets 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments  estimates  and a high degree of uncertainty in the preparation of our financial statements reserves 
our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved gas reserves 
proved gas reserves represent estimated quantities of gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production  and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering  and production data and  the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation  and judgment 
in addition  as a result of changing market conditions  natural gas prices and future development costs will change from year to year  causing estimates of proved reserves to also change 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our unevaluated properties  our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by d m  independent petroleum engineers 
gas properties the method of accounting for gas properties determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expenses 
we use the full cost method of accounting for gas properties as prescribed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
under this method  all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of our gas properties are capitalized and segregated into us and canadian cost centers 
gas properties are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense is significantly affected by the unamortized historical and future development costs and the estimated proved gas reserves 
estimation of proved gas reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent proved reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting period 
no gains or losses are recognized upon the sale or disposition of gas properties unless the sale or disposition represents a significant quantity of gas reserves  which would have a significant impact on the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
we perform a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether the net book value of our full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
the ceiling test is imposed separately for our us and canadian cost centers 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less related deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling limitation test is calculated using natural gas prices in effect as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for regional price differentials  held constant over the life of the reserves 
in addition  subsequent to the adoption of asc  the future cash outflows associated with settling asset 
table of contents retirement obligations are not included in the computation of the discounted present value of future net revenues for the purposes of the ceiling limitation test calculation 
unevaluated properties the costs directly associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development are not initially included in the amortization base and relate to unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination of proved reserves together with overhead and interest costs capitalized for these projects 
unevaluated leasehold costs are transferred to the amortization base once determination has been made or upon expiration of a lease 
geological and geophysical costs associated with a specific unevaluated property are transferred to the amortization base with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
all items included in our unevaluated property balance are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
any impairment to unevaluated properties is transferred to the amortization base 
asset retirement liability we adopted asc  effective january  it establishes accounting and reporting standards for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets that result from the legal obligation to plug  abandon and dismantle existing wells and facilities that we have acquired  constructed or developed 
it requires that the fair value of the liability for asset retirement obligations be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial recognition of the asset retirement liability  the asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
income taxes we record our income taxes using an asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates at the end of the period 
under asc  the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted change 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
estimating the amount of valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in stockholder ownership that could trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
asc also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a consistent threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and gas balancing 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas 
we use the sales method of accounting for the recognition of gas revenue whereby revenues  net of royalties  are recognized as the production is sold to purchaser 
the amount of gas sold may differ from the amount to which the company is entitled based on its working interest or net revenue interest in the properties 
we typically do not have any significant producer gas imbalance positions because we own working interest in the majority of our properties 
a ready market for natural gas allows us to sell our natural gas shortly after production at various pipeline receipt points at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer 
revenue is recorded when title is transferred based on our nominations and net revenue interests 
pipeline imbalances occur when our production delivered into the pipeline varies from the gas we nominated for sale 
pipeline imbalances are settled with cash approximately thirty days from date of production and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or increase of revenue depending upon whether we are over delivered or under delivered 

table of contents settlements of gas sales occur after the month in which the gas was produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period during which payments are received from the purchaser 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our hedging activities consist of derivative instruments entered into to hedge against changes in natural gas prices and changes in interest rates related to outstanding debt under our credit facility primarily through the use of fixed price swap agreements  basis swap agreements  three way collars  and traditional collars 
consistent with our hedging policy  we entered into a series of derivative instruments to hedge a significant portion of our expected natural gas production through and we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rates associated with a portion of our variable rate debt through typically  these derivative instruments require payments to receipts from counterparties based on specific indices as required by the derivative agreements 
these transactions are recorded in our financial statements in accordance with asc  formerly statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
although not risk free  we believe this policy will reduce our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations and changes in interest rates and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
as a result  our derivative instruments are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
in accordance with asc  as amended  all our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and changes in the fair market value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings for the natural gas derivatives or other comprehensive income loss for our interest rate swaps 
the natural gas derivatives have not been designated as hedge transactions while the interest rate swaps qualify and have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc at the inception of a derivative contract  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
for all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the hedged items as well as the risk management objective for entering into the derivative instrument 
to be designated as a cash flow hedge transaction  the relationship between the derivative and hedge items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the risk both at the inception of the derivative and on an ongoing basis 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc  formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method 
the application of asc requires the use of an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model  to measure the estimated fair value of the options and as a result various assumptions must be made by management that require judgment and the assumptions could be highly uncertain 
for share based awards outstanding prior to the adoption of asc  we will continue using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards before adoption 
therefore  we do not recognize any equity compensation cost on these prior awards in the future unless such awards are modified  repurchased or cancelled 
fair value measurement effective january   we adopted asc  formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are derived from unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
see disclosure related to the implementation of 
table of contents asc in note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fasb has also issued staff position fas fsp  which delays the effective date of asc for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected to defer the application of asc thereof to nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with fsp non recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the company has not applied the provisions of asc include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value  and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of asc in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
on january   we will adopt asc as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities  including nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination  impaired property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations 
there has been no significant impact to our consolidated audited financial statements related to the implementation of asc for our existing non financial assets and liabilities

gas sales decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in gas sales was a result of significantly lower natural gas prices  which decreased approximately excluding hedging transactions  partially offset by increased production  which increased 
the increase in production was principally attributable to the prior year development activities at our pond creek field and the commencement of gas sales in our garden city field in july  lasher field in october  and peace river in december  partially offset by the sale of an overriding royalty interest that was sold effective july  and decreased current year production in our gurnee field 

table of contents lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the million decrease in lease operating expenses consisted of million decrease in costs  partially offset by a million increase in production 
the million decrease in costs was primarily due to a company wide cost reduction strategy implemented in april  partially offset by increased expenses related to the commencement of gas sales in our garden city field in july  lasher field in october  and peace river in december compression expense 
compression expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in compression expense was primarily due to the addition of peace river compression costs where gas sales commenced on december  transportation expense 
transportation expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the increase was primarily due to the fact that a greater amount of excess capacity was released in the prior year period effectively reducing transportation expense for that period 
the excess transportation capacity that caused the increase was permanently released in may as a result of this permanent release  we expect to incur less transportation costs in the future 
production taxes 
production taxes decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in production taxes was primarily due to decreased natural gas sales caused by lower natural gas prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the depreciation  depletion and amortization increase consisted of million in accelerated depletion caused by estimated natural gas reserve revisions recorded as of september   offset by a million decrease due to the decrease in the depletion rate resulting from our ceiling write downs incurred to date 
impairment of gas properties 
for the year ended december   impairments recorded to gas properties were million  net of tax benefit of million 
these impairments were caused by lower natural gas prices  as well as downward reserve revisions due in large part to continued under performance in the gurnee field 
we were able to limit the effect of lower natural gas prices through our ongoing cost reduction strategy  which we implemented in april general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the primary driver of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was the cost reduction strategy implemented in april  offset by million less capitalized overhead as a result of decreased drilling activities 
realized gains losses on derivative contracts 
realized gains on derivative contracts were million in the current year period as compared to realized losses of million in the prior year period 
realized losses represent net cash flow settlements paid to the contract counterparty  while realized gains represent net cash flow settlements paid to us from the contract counterparty 
realized losses occur when natural gas prices exceed the derivative ceiling prices 
conversely  realized gains occur when natural gas prices go below the derivative floor prices 
unrealized losses gains from the change in market value of open derivative contracts 
unrealized losses on open derivative contracts were million in the current year period as compared to unrealized gains of million in the prior year period 
unrealized losses and gains are non cash transactions that occur when the corresponding asset or liability derivative contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the increase is due to the effect of a 
table of contents higher average outstanding debt balance in the current year period  partially offset by a lower average interest rate in the current year period 
additionally  the prior year included million of capitalized interest for which there was no comparable capitalized interest in the current year period as a result of no drilling activity 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increased benefit was primarily the result of the impairments recorded to gas properties of million  net of tax benefit of million 
these impairments were caused by lower natural gas prices  as well as downward revisions due in large part to continued under performance in the gurnee field 
we were able to limit the effect of lower natural gas prices through our ongoing cost reduction strategy  which we implemented in april the effective tax rate for the period was 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was different than the amount computed using the statutory rate as follows us canada total amount computed using statutory rates state income taxes net of federal benefit valuation allowance nondeductible items and other income tax benefit provision year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following are selected items derived from our consolidated statement of operations and their percentage changes from the comparable period are presented below

gas sales increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the increase in gas sales was a result of both increased gas prices and production 
production increased and average gas prices  excluding hedging transactions  increased 
the million increase in gas sales consisted of a million increase in production and a million increase in average prices 
the increase in production was principally attributable to the continued development activities at our pond creek and gurnee fields 

table of contents lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year 
the million increase in lease operating expenses consisted of million increase in production and million increase in costs 
compression expense 
compression expense increased by million  or  to million compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in compression expense consisted of a million increase in production and a million increase in costs 
the million increase in costs was primarily due to an increase in repair and maintenance expenses for the compressors in our pond creek field 
transportation expense 
transportation expense decreased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the decrease was primarily due to lower transportation expenses resulting from the commencement of transportation on our own system from the pond creek field and the temporary release of a portion of our firm capacity commitments related to our pond creek field 
production taxes 
production taxes increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the increase in production taxes was due to the phase in of state taxes on production of natural gas in our pond creek field  higher gas prices and increased production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the depreciation  depletion and amortization increase consisted of a million increase in production and a million increase in the depletion rate 
impairment of gas properties 
at december   the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by approximately million 
for the year ended december   no such write down was recorded 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million compared to the prior year period 
the primary driver for the increased general and administrative expenses was increased office expense  share based awards and investor relation expense  offset by a decrease in employee bonuses 
realized losses gains on derivative contracts 
realized losses on derivative contracts were million in the current year period as compared to million of realized gains in the prior year period 
realized losses represent net cash flow settlements paid to the counterparty while realized gains represent net cash flow settlement paid to us from the counterparty 
realized losses occur when natural gas prices or the derivative index price exceeds the derivative ceiling price

table of contents natural gas price risk and related hedging activities 
the energy markets have historically been very volatile  and there can be no assurance that natural gas prices will not be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
in an effort to reduce the effects of the volatility of the price of natural gas on our operations  management has adopted a policy of hedging natural gas prices from time to time primarily using derivative instruments in the form of three way collars  traditional collars and swaps 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits future gains from favorable movements 
our price risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
we enter into hedging transactions  generally for forward periods up to two years or more  which increase the probability of achieving our targeted level of cash flows 
we generally limit the amount of these hedges during any period to no more than to of the then expected gas production for such future periods 
swaps exchange floating price risk in the future for a fixed price at the time of the hedge 
costless collars set both a maximum ceiling a sold ceiling and a minimum floor a bought floor future price 
three way costless collars are similar to regular costless collars except that  in order to increase the ceiling price  we agree to limit the amount of the floor price protection through a sold floor to a predetermined amount  generally between and per mmbtu below the bought floor 
we have accounted for these transactions using the mark to market accounting method 
generally  we incur accounting losses on derivatives during periods where prices are rising and gains during periods where prices are falling which may cause significant fluctuations in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that the use of derivative instruments does not expose us to material risk 
however  the use of derivative instruments may materially affect our financial position and results of operations as a result of changes in the estimated market value of our natural gas derivatives 
nevertheless  we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
commodity price risk and related hedging activities at december   we had the following natural gas collar positions period volume mmbtu sold ceiling bought floor sold floor fair value january through march january through march april through october april through october november through march at december   we had the following natural gas swap positions period volume mmbtu price fair value april through october april through october november through march november through march april through october november through march 
table of contents interest rate risks and related hedging activities when we enter into an interest rate swap  we may designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge  at which time we prepare the documentation required under asc hedges of our interest rate are designated as cash flow hedges based on whether the interest on the underlying debt is converted to a fixed interest rate 
changes in derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as other comprehensive income or loss to the extent that they are effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
we use fixed rate swaps to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the objective of realizing a fixed cash flow stream from these activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are natural gas prices per mcf in effect  adjusted for regional price differentials 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
at december   a decrease in the prices received for natural gas production would have had a negative impact of approximately million on our revenues 
interest rate risk 
we have long term debt subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at december  the average interest rate for the outstanding amount of the revolving credit facility was per annum  respectively 
borrowing availability at december  was million 
all of the debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility accrues interest at floating or market rates 
fluctuations in market interest rates will cause our interest costs to fluctuate 
based upon the balance outstanding under our revolving 
table of contents credit facility at december   a increase in market interest rates would have increased interest expense and negatively impacted our annual cash flows by approximately million 
million of the outstanding balance was excluded from our market rate analysis due to lack of interest rate exposure based on the interest rate swaps we have in place 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in canada and do not have operations in any other foreign countries 
we do not hedge our foreign currency risk and are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the canadian dollar 
because our cash flows from our canadian project are not material  changes in the exchange rate do not significantly impact our revenues or expenses but primarily affect the costs of unevaluated properties 
we continue to monitor the foreign currency exchange rate in canada and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk in the future
