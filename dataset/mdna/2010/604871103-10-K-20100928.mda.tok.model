a weakening of the english pound and euro  in relation to the us dollar  will have the effect of increasing recorded revenues and profits  while a weakening of the english pound and euro will have the opposite effect

critical accounting policies general financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the sec in december  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report includes a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill  property  plant and equipment and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following are our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors aging reports  collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales by product  projections of future demand by product  the risk of technological or competitive obsolescence for our products  general market conditions  and the feasibility of reworking or using excess or obsolete products or components in the production or assembly of other products that are not obsolete or for which we do not have excess quantities in inventory 
to the extent that we determine there are excess or obsolete quantities  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products to adjust their carrying value to estimated net realizable value 
if future demand or market conditions are different from our projections  or if we are unable to rework excess or obsolete quantities into other products  we may change the recorded amount of inventory valuation reserves through a charge or reduction in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company capitalizes items in excess of  minor replacements and maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the useful life of the related asset  whichever is shorter 
inventory items included in property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of to years 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 

table of contents revenue recognition the company records revenue upon shipment for products shipped fob shipping point 
products shipped fob destination points are recorded as revenue when received at the point of destination 
shipments under agreements with distributors are not subject to return  and payment for these shipments is not contingent on sales by the distributor 
the company recognizes revenue on shipments to distributors in the same manner as with other customers 
fees from exclusive license agreements are recognized ratably over the terms of the respective agreements 
service contract and royalty income are recognized when earned

asc and asc  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
we review goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of significant assets or products 
application of these impairment tests requires significant judgments  including estimation of cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in the projected cash flows and discount rate estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation of identifiable intangible assets  in process research and development  and goodwill could materially affect the determination of fair value at acquisition or during subsequent periods when tested for impairment 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for fiscal and in the respective fourth quarter 
there were no indicators that goodwill recorded was impaired 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
stock based compensation the company previously accounted for stock option plans under asc no 
as permitted under this standard  compensation cost was recognized using the intrinsic value method described in apb no 
the company subsequently adopted the fair value recognition provisions of asc no 
share based payment asc and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
using the modified prospective transition method  therefore  prior periods have not been restated
