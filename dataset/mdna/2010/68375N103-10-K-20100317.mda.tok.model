table of contents overview we are a specialty healthcare company involved in the discovery  development  and commercialization of pharmaceutical products  medical devices  vaccines  diagnostic technologies  and imaging systems 
initially focused on the treatment and management of ophthalmic diseases  we have since expanded into other areas of major unmet medical need 
we expect to incur substantial losses as we continue the development of our product candidates  continue our other research and development activities  and establish a sales and marketing infrastructure in anticipation of the commercialization of our pharmaceutical product candidates 
we currently have limited commercialization capabilities  and it is possible that we may never successfully commercialize any of our pharmaceutical product candidates

since our inception  we have not generated sufficient gross margins to offset our operating and other expenses and our primary source of cash has been from the private placement of stock and credit facilities available to us 
on october   we acquired pharma genexx  a privately owned chilean company engaged in the marketing  sales  commercialization and distribution of pharmaceutical products  over the counter products and medical devices for government  private and institutional markets in chile for us million in cash

we are obligated to pay interest upon maturity  compounded quarterly  on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at an annual rate  which is due january  the line of credit is collateralized by all of our personal property except our intellectual property 
we believe the cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  and the amounts available to be borrowed under existing lines of credit  are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service for the next months 
we based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change  and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect 
if we acquire additional assets or companies  accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials  including trials for rolapitant  we will need additional funds 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors  including possible acquisitions  the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates  the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing  and our success in developing markets for our product candidates 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs 
we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur substantial research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales  marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure 

table of contents we intend to finance additional research and development projects  clinical trials and our future operations with a combination of private placements  payments from potential strategic research and development  licensing and or marketing arrangements  public offerings  debt financing  and revenues from future product sales  if any 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
the following table provides information as of december  with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period 
contractual obligations in thousands after total open purchase orders operating leases credit line total the preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable  including contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials  which are payable on a per patient basis and product license agreements that include payments upon achievement of certain milestones 
in addition to the principal balance as shown on our credit line  we also must pay interest upon the maturity of the credit line in january critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation 
we recognize equity based compensation as an expense in our financial statements and that cost is measured at the fair value of the award and expensed over their vesting period 
equity based compensation arrangements to non employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the black scholes merton formula or the black scholes model and allocate the resulting compensation expense over the corresponding requisite service period associated with each grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends and risk free interest rate 
we perform significant analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the black scholes model 
we also perform significant analyses to estimate forfeitures of equity based awards 
we are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share based awards that ultimately vest 
the selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
appraisals inherently require significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process research and development projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the pharma genexx assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
certain of our products are sold directly to end users and require that we deliver  install and train the staff at the end users facility 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until the product is delivered  installed and training has occurred 
return policies in certain international markets for our medical device products provide for stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method 
our reported net loss is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued an amendment to the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment details additional disclosures on fair value measurements  requires a gross presentation of activities within a level rollforward  and adds a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of level and level measurements 
the new disclosures are required of all entities that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this amendment is effective in the first interim or reporting period beginning after december   with an exception for the gross presentation of level rollforward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and for interim reporting periods within those years 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for own share lending arrangements in contemplation of convertible debt issuance or other financing 
this amendment clarifies how an entity should account for an agreement between a company share lender and an investment bank share borrower under which the company loans shares of its stock to the investment bank  enabling the investment bank to use the shares to enter into equity derivative contracts with the ultimate investors of the convertible debt 
under the amendment  at the date of issuance  the share lending arrangement is required to be measured at fair value and recognized as a debt issuance cost in the financial statements of the entity 
the debt issuance cost should be amortized under the effective interest method over the life of the financing arrangement as interest cost 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this amendment requires retrospective application for all arrangements outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is initially applied 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amendment provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated  and how the consideration paid should be allocated 
as a result of this amendment  entities may be able to separate multiple deliverable arrangements in more circumstances than under existing accounting guidance 
this guidance amends the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services based on objective evidence and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the existing guidance previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item reflect the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this amendment will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption and retrospective application is also permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this amendment on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
this amendment requires an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary  or consolidator  of a vie based on whether the entity i has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie  and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the amendment changes the consideration of kick out rights in determining if an entity is a vie and requires an ongoing reconsideration of both whether an entity is a vie and of the primary beneficiary 
this amendment is effective as of january   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the amendment requires companies to reassess  under the amended requirements  arrangements existing on or before the effective date of the amendment that may fit within its scope and requires retrospective application 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this amendment but do not expect it will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets 
this amendment seeks to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance and cash flows  and a transferor s continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
additionally  on and after the effective date  this amendment eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
this amendment is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we may from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 
our derivative activities  which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts  are initiated to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at maturity  and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are hedged 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
we enter into these contracts with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and do not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions 
we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   and none at december   primarily to hedge chilean based operating cash flows against us dollars 
if chilean pesos were to strengthen in relation to the us dollar  our hedged foreign currency cash flows expense would be offset by a loss on the derivative contracts  with a net effect of zero 
we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price  or equity price risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings 
we maintain an investment portfolio of money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the weighted average interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was 
as of december   the principal value of our credit lines was million  and have a weighted average interest rate of 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  bank obligations  repurchase agreements and high quality corporate issuers  and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than one month
