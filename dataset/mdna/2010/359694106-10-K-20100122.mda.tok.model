item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hb fuller company is a global formulator  manufacturer and marketer of adhesives and other specialty chemical products 
we are managed through four regional operating segments north america  europe  middle east and africa emea  latin america and asia pacific 
each of the four segments manufactures and supplies adhesives products in the assembly  packaging  converting  nonwoven and hygiene  performance wood  flooring  textile  flexible packaging  graphic arts and envelope markets 
in addition  the north america segment provides specialty construction products such as ceramic tile installation products and hvac adhesives and sealants 
the latin america segment also manufactures and sells paints primarily in the central american countries 
total company when reviewing our financial statements  it is important to understand how certain external factors impact us 
these factors include changes in the prices of commodities  such as crude oil and natural gas global supply and demand of raw materials economic growth rates  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar we purchase thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of our cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  our financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from commodity prices  the supply and demand of raw materials also have a significant impact on our costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  also can have an impact as key raw material producers are shut down for extended periods of time 
we continually monitor areas such as capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect our raw materials 
in we generated percent of our net revenue in the us and percent in emea 
net revenue generated in the us was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which we supply products 
for example  adhesives related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the overall economic activity 
in business components such as specialty construction and insulating glass  revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  our revenues and costs increase as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar have the largest impact on our financial results as compared to all other currencies 
in  the currency fluctuations had a negative impact on net revenue of million as compared to although the dollar weakened sequentially throughout  on average  the dollar was stronger than it was in the estimated impact on earnings per share was a decrease of as compared to key financial results and transactions for included the following net revenue declined percent from primarily due to declines in sales volume resulting from the depressed global economy 

table of contents gross profit margin improved to percent from percent in contributed million to fund our defined benefit pension plans  primarily in the us and germany 
cash flow generated from operating activities  was million in as compared to million in settled a lawsuit with the former owners of the roanoke companies group  a business we acquired in the settlement resulted in a pretax gain of million which was million after tax or per diluted share 
completed acquisition of the outstanding shares of nordic adhesive technology gmbh 
located in buxtehude  germany on april  for approximately million 
the global economic conditions continued to have a negative impact on our sales volume in the economic slowdown that began primarily in the us construction and housing markets in  expanded to most major markets and industries in and continued throughout the credit crisis in late exacerbated the situation 
our sales volume decreased percent in as compared to  however we started to see positive signs in our sales volumes in the fourth quarter as sales volumes declined only percent as compared to the fourth quarter of although was a challenging year in terms of the economic environment  we were able to improve our eps to per share from in the figure included a negative per share related to goodwill and other impairment charges 
in we continued to invest to make hb fuller a stronger company 
investments made in included additional resources in our sales and marketing organizations  strengthening our management team  building a manufacturing facility in china  and the nordic acquisition in germany 
outlook there remains a significant amount of uncertainty for in regards to end market demand 
while we believe the worst is most likely behind us  we do not anticipate a quick return to pre recession demand levels 
in terms of net revenue growth  with the investments we have made and will continue to make in our sales and technical organizations  we expect to have positive revenue growth in the gross profit margin will come under some pressure in as raw material costs are expected to increase 
sg a expenses will most likely increase in as compared to as we continue to invest in the future of the company and we will also have the full year impact of investments made in the current economic environment makes it very difficult to make accurate projections of future financial results 
therefore  no specific quantitative guidance for is included in this report 
we are committed to executing our long range strategy while managing through the economic uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill impairment assessment  long lived assets recoverability  share based compensation accounting  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us we sponsor other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance 
table of contents costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates 
through  the annual measurement date for the benefit obligations and plan assets was august  but in accordance with changes in us gaap we now measure our benefit obligations and plan assets as of our fiscal year end 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of assumptions employed in these measurements for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is determined using an actuarial tool that applies a yield curve approach which enables us to select a discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the plan 
the tool identifies a broad universe of corporate bonds that meet the quality and size criteria for the particular plan 
this is in contrast to using a specific index that has a certain set of bonds that may or may not be representative of the characteristics of our particular plan 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate for the us pension plan was percent at november   as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year is based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year 
a discount rate reduction of percentage points at november  would increase pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pretax in fiscal discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets in the portfolio 
the disruption in the credit markets at the end of and the ongoing economic slowdown impacted our investment strategy for the pension portfolios  which in turn  has impacted our assumption for the expected return on assets 
our current investment strategy for the us pension plan is to invest percent of the portfolio in equities and percent in fixed income securities 
this strategy represents a change from an allocation in prior years of percent equities and percent fixed income 
the change in strategy was primarily intended to reduce volatility of plan assets in future periods and to more closely match the duration of the plan assets with the duration of the plan liabilities 
higher volatility in the asset values results in higher volatility in the annual expenses associated with the plans 
asset values declined significantly from the august measurement date in into the second quarter of due to the deterioration of the credit markets before rebounding for the remainder of the combination of the reduced asset values and the higher pension obligations due to the lower discount rate resulted in our pension plans being significantly under funded 
therefore  in the fourth quarter of we elected to contribute million to the us pension plan for the purpose of restoring the asset values up to the level of the projected benefit obligations and to reduce net periodic benefit cost 
as of november  the us pension plan assets were just percent below the plan s projected benefit obligations 
as of november  the million had not yet been allocated to the targeted investments  therefore  the investment mix of assets as of november  was percent equities and percent fixed income securities 
we plan to reallocate the portfolio to the new target allocation in the first six months of our investment strategy for the non us pension plans was also amended in to being more balanced between equities and fixed income securities 
for reasons similar to the us plan  we also contributed million to the german plan in the fourth quarter of the expected return on assets used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan was percent for and percent for and for  the rate will decrease to percent to reflect the change in the target mix of assets to percent equities and percent fixed income 
a change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million pretax 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans is determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  we have used the rate of percent for  percent for and percent for 
table of contents goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all the activities within a reporting unit are available to support the value of goodwill 
accounting standards require us to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the estimated fair value 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
our judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures  etc 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
in after our initial assessment  completed during the fourth quarter based on balance sheet information as of the end of our third quarter  we determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
after our initial assessment  as economic conditions worsened and the capital markets became distressed  we determined that circumstances had changed enough to trigger another goodwill impairment assessment as of november  that assessment resulted in the determination that the fair value of our specialty construction reporting unit was less than the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill 
this was due to a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected from the reporting unit 
the adverse economic conditions  especially in the us housing and other construction markets  were the primary driver of the reduction in forecasted discounted cash flows 
the amount of the pretax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was million million after tax 
the million pretax charge was an estimated amount as of november  the final valuation work was completed in the first quarter of and resulted in an additional pretax impairment charge of million million after tax 
the amount of goodwill assigned to the specialty construction reporting unit was million prior to any impairment charges 
after the final valuation and additional impairment charge  the amount of goodwill is million 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
there were no indications of impairment 
the specialty construction reporting unit continues to be the only reporting unit with a significant risk of impairment 
as the construction markets  particularly us housing starts  continued to slide in  the specialty construction reporting unit fell short of its revenue projections in profit margins did improve however to significantly offset the impact of the net revenue decline 
the fair value for the specialty construction reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
the projected cash flows used in the fair value calculation were based on no economic growth in as the net revenue growth projected for for specialty construction was based primarily on new business that was already procured during for years beyond  the net revenue projections assume slightly higher growth in and with a 
table of contents leveling off in the low single digits for the remaining years 
profit margins for the specialty construction reporting unit are projected to grow primarily due to sales volume increases as the cost structure and manufacturing capability is in place to support a significantly higher sales volume than was recorded in although we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the specialty construction reporting unit were realistic  the continued slowdown of the us residential construction industry could have an adverse impact on specialty construction s future cash flows 
if the reporting unit does not meet its revenue and cash flow projections for  then the fair value could fall below the carrying value of the net assets 
that would trigger a step analysis and could lead to an impairment charge if the implied goodwill is calculated to be less than the million goodwill balance 
in all other reporting units  the calculated fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of the net assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects our assumptions and estimates 
factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  currency exchange  and tax rates and capital spending 
significant judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
share based compensation we have granted stock options  restricted stock and deferred compensation awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after december  and prior to but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with accounting standards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification tm asc and  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
we believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility 
thus  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability is 
table of contents probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
as of november   we have accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
we have also recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at our sorocaba  brazil facility as of november  a complete discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments and or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at november   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income tax accounting 
results of operations net revenue in millions vs vs net revenue net revenue in of  decreased million or percent from revenue of  million 
the net revenue was million or percent below the net revenue of  million in we review variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years vs vs product pricing sales volume currency acquisitions organic sales growth  which we define as the combined variances from product pricing and sales volume  was a negative percent negative percent from sales volume and positive percent from selling prices in 
table of contents as compared to the sales volume declines were directly related to the continuation of the slow global economy 
the volume trend in terms of year over year comparisons improved in the second half of the year  partially due to the weaker second half of the negative currency effects resulted from the stronger us dollar as compared to most major foreign currencies  such as the euro  australian dollar and canadian dollar  as compared to the net revenue variances from acquisitions were due to the egymelt acquisition in the fourth quarter of and the acquisition of nordic adhesive technology during the second quarter of sales volume declines in vs 
were driven by the economic slowdowns  especially in north america and europe 
quarterly sales volume decreases as compared to were improving through the first nine months of the year 
during the fourth quarter  however  in conjunction with the disruption in the global financial and credit markets  the fourth quarter negative impact on net revenue due to sales volume declines was percent 
revenues generated from increases in selling prices in response to rising raw material costs partially offset the effects of the volume declines 
the positive impact from currency resulted primarily from the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
that positive impact through the first nine months of was percent  however in the fourth quarter the dollar strengthened against the euro and other major currencies 
cost of sales in millions vs vs cost of sales percent of net revenue the cost of sales decreased percent in compared to the decrease was driven primarily by the percent decline in sales volume in lower raw material prices and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations also contributed to the lower cost of sales in as compared to the cost of sales included million of charges related to the realignment of production capacity in the north america operating segment 
the cost of sales increased percent in  compared to  despite the sales volume decrease of percent 
this was a direct result of double digit growth in raw material costs 
the inflation rate on raw materials as measured from year end to year end was estimated at nearly percent 
the impact on raw material expense included in cost of sales was estimated at a percent increase 
the difference in rates reflects the ramping up of raw material prices throughout the year 
a key factor in the raw material cost increase was the price of crude oil  which reached record levels during the year of nearly per barrel 
the raw material price increases were tempered late in the year as the economy continued to slow down and the price of oil decreased 
gross profit in millions vs vs gross profit percent of net revenue the higher gross profit margin for as compared to was driven primarily by the combination of lower raw material costs  product line reformulations and management of our selling prices 
average selling prices increased percent for as compared to selling price increases in did not keep pace with the increases in raw material costs resulting in a percentage point decline in the gross profit margin as compared to the speed and magnitude of the raw material price increases created a difficult environment for raising selling prices in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in millions vs vs sg a percent of net revenue sg a expenses increased million in compared to the expenses increased compared to last year due primarily to investments made in the sales and technical organizations to support future growth  the costs added from the egymelt and nordic acquisitions and increases in management incentive compensation 
as a percent of net revenue  the sg a expenses were percent in and percent in a primary reason for the increase in the percent of net revenue is that sg a expenses are generally fixed in nature over the short term and therefore do not fluctuate as rapidly as the net revenue figures 
the sg a expenses in decreased from in terms of both dollars and as a percent of net revenue 
reduced headcount  lower pension expenses  reduced management incentive compensation and stringent cost controls all contributed to the reduced sg a expenses 
sg a discretionary spending was tightly controlled throughout the year as the combined effects of decreases in net revenue and increases in raw material costs limited the available funding for sg a expenditures 
goodwill and other impairment charges in millions goodwill and other impairment charges in the fourth quarter of an million impairment charge was taken as a reduction of the goodwill balance of the specialty construction reporting unit 
this amount was considered an estimate as of november  with final valuation work to be completed in the first quarter of the additional charge of million in the first quarter of was the result of the final valuation work 
the goodwill and other impairment charges in consisted of the million of goodwill impairment charges and million related to two cost method investments carried on the corporate entity s balance sheet 
other income  net in millions other income  net the million gain from the roanoke litigation settlement referred to in the overview section of this report was recorded as other income in interest income was million in compared to million in and million in lower interest rates and lower average cash balances both contributed to the reduced interest income in as compared to and currency transaction and remeasurement losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates during combined with changes in foreign currency exposures were the main reasons for the higher losses in as compared to last year 
interest expense in millions vs vs interest expense 
table of contents the year over year decrease in the interest expense was due to the lower average debt balance and lower interest rates in as compared to the increased interest expense in as compared to resulted primarily from the increase in debt during to fund the share repurchase program 
due to reduced cash flow generation in  we did not pay down debt during the year 
income taxes in millions income taxes effective tax rate income tax expense in of million included million of discrete tax benefits in both the us and foreign jurisdictions and million of tax expense related to the million gain associated with the roanoke litigation settlement 
excluding these two items  the overall effective tax rate decreased slightly in as compared to the rate without discrete tax benefits and goodwill and other impairment charges 
income taxes were a credit to the income statement in due to million of tax benefits related to the million of pretax goodwill and other impairment charges discussed above 
the income taxes also included a million benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance in brazil 
excluding the effects of these two items the effective income tax rate was higher in as compared to primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of pretax earnings 
minority interests in income loss of subsidiaries in millions minority interests in income loss of subsidiaries minority interests in income loss of subsidiaries relates to the percent holding that sekisui chemical has in our china entities 
the increases and decreases result from the changes in the net income of the china entities 
income from equity investments in millions vs vs income from equity investments the income from equity investments relates to our percent ownership of the sekisui fuller joint venture in japan 
the results reflect the higher net income recorded by the joint venture in compared to and due mainly to stronger gross profit margins

excluding these items  the net income was essentially flat with the level 
the lower net revenue in as compared to was offset by the improved gross profit margin 
in addition to the goodwill and other impairment charges recorded in  raw material cost inflation and the global economic slowdown were the main factors in the decrease in net income as compared to operating segment results our operations are managed through the four primary geographic regions north america  emea  latin america and asia pacific

total north america the continued slowdown in the us economy was the primary driver for net revenue declining percent in as compared to the economic slowdown impacted all markets with the construction related markets still being hit the hardest 
sales volume decreased percent while average selling prices were percent above last year 
the increase in average selling prices resulted from pricing

gross profit margins increased in in response to decreasing raw material costs 
the improvement in the gross profit margin was the primary reason for operating income increasing more than percent over as a percent of net revenue the operating income was percent in and percent in the percent net revenue decrease in as compared to was driven by decreases exceeding percent in the specialty construction component 
the revenue in this component has a direct correlation with the construction industry in the us especially with us housing starts 
with housing starts continuing to decline in  it was not unusual for the revenues of the specialty construction component to show a significant decrease 
the disruption in the financial markets in the fourth quarter of also had a negative impact on the specialty construction component 
raw material costs increased nearly percent in the north america segment  which impacted both business components 
the decreased gross profit margin was the primary reason for the percent decrease in operating income 
the operating income margin decreased to percent in from percent in adhesives net revenue in the adhesives component declined percent in as compared to increases in average selling prices of percent as compared to partially offset the percent decrease in sales volume 
the adhesives sales volumes were down across most major product lines and industries as a result of the slow us economy 
in million in charges were recorded in cost of sales related to the realignment of production capacity in response to the reduced sales volume 
decreases in raw material prices combined with effective selling price management resulted in an improved gross profit margin in as compared to sg a expenses increased in as key management vacancies were filled  investments were made in sales and marketing and variable compensation expense increased as the financial performance improved 
overall  the gross profit margin improvement was the key driver in operating income increasing percent in as compared to comparing with  sales volume decreases of percent were partially mitigated by the percent increase in average selling prices 
pricing activity was more aggressive in the second half of the year as raw material prices escalated 
the sales volume declines were driven by the slowdown in the us economy as the slowdown in went beyond just the construction related industries 
the raw material cost inflation exceeded the impacts from selling price increases resulting in a decreased gross profit margin from sg a expense decreases in were not enough to offset the negative effects of the raw material increases 
operating income declined percent compared to specialty construction the construction related industries in the u 
s continued to be sluggish in  especially residential market conditions 
major customers in this component are wholesale ceramic tile and flooring distributors selling directly to contractors and also large retail outlets 
these customers were directly impacted by the slowdown in the us housing industry 
us housing starts continued to decline throughout to a point in which the annualized housing start figure reported in october was only million  the lowest figure reported in at least years 
this was the primary factor in the specialty construction net revenue declining percent in as compared to decreases in raw material costs were the main reason for improvements in the gross profit margin in as compared to manufacturing costs in decreased from as costs were managed downward in response to the lower sales volume 
the strength of the gross profit margin was not enough to offset the decrease in sales volume as operating income decreased percent compared to significant new customers were added in however the combination of the slow economy and high raw material costs resulted in a gross profit margin decrease of approximately six percentage points as compared to also negatively impacting the gross profit margin was the customer sales mix 
significant sales volume decreases in related to lost business that carried high gross profit margins  this business also carried high 
table of contents sg a expenses

the fourth quarter net revenue actually had a negative impact from currency as compared to the fourth quarter of sales volume decreased percent primarily a result of the economic slowdown 
industrial production was down in both germany and the uk in and the economies of the iberian peninsula were especially hard hit during substantial raw material increases were incurred throughout the europe operating segment in the resulting decrease in the gross profit margin drove the operating income down percent as compared to the egymelt acquisition added million of net revenue to the europe results and a million operating loss

the sales volume in the paints component was hit especially hard as this is a more consumer driven market than adhesives and therefore  was impacted more negatively by the slow economy 
the gross profit margin increased from due to reductions in raw material costs combined with the increases in average selling prices 
operating income for the latin america segment was percent above the latin america segment s revenue growth in was driven by the percent growth in the paints component as compared to adhesives net revenue fell percent below sales volume increased percent in the paints component and decreased percent in adhesives 
gross margin pressure caused by raw material cost inflation drove the segment operating income down percent in as compared to raw material cost increases throughout the year were approximately percent on average 
the raw material inflation rate  however from year end to year end approximated percent 
both paints and adhesives recorded operating income decreases over percent as compared to adhesives sales volume decreases of percent in were offset by increases in average selling prices of percent as compared to the adhesives group had a strong finish to their year to achieve a net revenue result that exceeded last year 
the gross profit margin improved from as raw material prices declined in the percent increase in revenue and improved gross profit margin were the primary reason for the percent operating income improvement in as compared to the sales volume decreases in resulted from the slower economic activity as well as certain market share losses in the second half of customers were cutting back on their inventory levels  particularly in the latter part of the year 
average selling price increases of percent helped mitigate the sales volume shortfall however the gross margin declined over percentage points due to the raw material increases 
the operating income as a percent of net revenue fell to percent in as compared to percent in paints sales volume declined percent in as compared to the volume decline was partially offset by increases in average selling prices of percent for paints is a consumer driven market  therefore the high unemployment rates and overall slow economy in had a pronounced negative impact on the paints sales volume

investments in retail stores during had a positive impact on the net revenue growth 
the net revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter of in large part due to the effects of severe weather in honduras  panama and costa rica

new customer wins and economic recovery in some markets both contributed to the improved sales volume performance 
average selling prices had a positive percent impact on net revenue in as compared to the increases in average selling prices were the result of actions taken in the second half of in response to the escalation in raw material costs during that time 
the percent net revenue reduction due to currency  in compared to  was primarily driven by the weakening of the australian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
operating income of million was percent below due to the percent decrease in net revenue and relatively flat gross profit margin and sg a expenses 
sales volume growth in adhesives was the key driver of the overall net revenue growth in the asia pacific segment for as compared to positive currency effects contributed percent to the net revenue growth in  however similar to the euro  the effects were negative in the fourth quarter 
the currency effects in the asia pacific segment are driven largely by the australian dollar versus the us dollar 
asia pacific incurred similar gross profit margin pressures as the other operating segments due to raw material cost increases 
the raw material cost increases  which were minimal through the first half of the year  escalated to upwards of percent by the end of on a year over year basis

table of contents we believe that the combination of cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing facilities committed to as of year end and in december will be adequate to meet our ongoing liquidity and capital expenditure needs 
we believe we have the ability to obtain both short term and long term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future 
on december   subsequent to our fiscal year end  we entered into a note purchase agreement under which we agreed to issue million in fixed rate senior unsecured notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our credit agreements include restrictive covenants that  if not met  could lead to a renegotiation of our credit lines and a significant increase in our cost of financing

additionally  the majority of our cash in non us locations is permanently reinvested 
we rely on operating cash flow  short term borrowings and long term debt to provide for the working capital needs of our operations 
we believe that we have the ability to obtain both short term and long term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future 
debt outstanding and debt capacity notes payable notes payable were million at november  this amount mainly represented various short term borrowings that were not part of committed lines 
the weighted average interest rates on these short term borrowings were and percent in and  respectively 
long term debt long term debt consisted of senior notes and a term loan 
the senior notes bear a fixed interest rate  which averages percent and mature in we are subject to prepayment penalties on our senior notes 
as of november   make whole premiums were estimated to be  if the entire debt were paid off  million 
we currently have no intention to prepay any senior notes

lines of credit we have a million revolving credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions at november  this credit agreement creates an unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility that we can draw upon for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement also contains an accordion feature  which allows us to increase the aggregate credit facility size to up to million 
exercise of the accordion feature requires the approval of the consortium of financial institutions 
interest is payable at the london interbank offered rate libor plus percent 
a facility fee of percent is payable quarterly 
both the interest rate and the facility fee percentage are based on a rating grid 
the credit facility expires on december  as of november   we had million drawn on our committed lines of credit 
firm commitment on december   subsequent to our fiscal year end  we entered into a note purchase agreement under which we agreed to issue million in fixed rate senior unsecured notes in the us private placement market 
the proceeds of the issuance will be used to pay down our revolving credit facility  which will leave this facility largely unutilized 
this private placement debt was actually priced on november  at that time  the agreements became legally binding and the commitment to borrow the prescribed funds at the fixed rate constituted a firm commitment 
also on november  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of obtaining a floating rate of interest on million of the private placement debt 
we have designated the firm commitment to borrow million as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
as required by the accounting standards  we recorded an asset for the fair value of the interest rate swaps hedging instruments totaling million and recognized a liability of million for the fair value of the firm commitment hedged item 
this calculation resulted in million being recorded as the fair value of the firm commitment  which is included in long term debt as of november

selected metrics of liquidity and capital resources key metrics we monitor are net working capital as a percent of annualized net revenue  trade account receivable days sales outstanding dso  inventory days on hand  free cash flow and debt capitalization ratio 
in the second quarter of we changed the calculation for the accounts receivable dso and inventory days on hand 
for dso  we previously used a day sales calculation and we have changed to a day calculation  which represents the last two months of the quarter 
this provides a better representation of the dso  which were days as of november  for inventory days on hand  we previously used a quarter average for the inventory and a previous months for the cost of sales denominator 
the purpose of this calculation was to smooth out the significant quarterly fluctuations 
we have now changed to use the previous days of cost of sales and the actual inventory as of the quarter end date 
we believe both of these metrics now provide a better representation of the current business activity and are more aligned with how the businesses are managed 
the new formulas for the calculations are shown below the tables november  november  net working capital as a percentage of annualized net revenue accounts receivable dso days days inventory days on hand days days free cash flow million million debt capitalization ratio current quarter net working capital trade receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts plus inventory minus trade payables divided by annualized net revenue current quarter multiplied by four 
trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts multiplied by weeks and divided by the net revenue for the last months of the quarter 
total inventory multiplied by and divided by cost of sales excluding delivery costs for the last months of the quarter 
net cash provided by operations less purchased property  plant and equipment and dividends paid 
total debt divided by total debt plus total stockholders equity 
another key metric is the return on gross investment  or rogi 
the calculation is represented by gross cash flow divided by gross investment 
gross cash flow is defined as gross profit less sg a expenses less taxes at a non gaap standard rate of percent plus depreciation and amortization expenses less maintenance capital expenditures  a non gaap financial measure defined as percent of total depreciation expense 
gross cash flow is calculated using trailing month information 

table of contents gross investment is defined as total assets plus accumulated depreciation less non debt current liabilities less cash 
rogi was introduced because we believe it provides a true measure of return on investment  it is a better way to internally measure performance and it is focused on the long term 
the rogi calculated at november  was percent as compared to percent at november  higher gross investment in as compared to was the primary reason for the decrease in rogi 
the following table shows the rogi calculation based on the definition above compared to a calculation using all gaap based data 
we believe the use of certain non gaap financial measures provides a better calculation of rogi because they eliminate fluctuations not specifically related to the return on the current investment base 
trailing months as of november  in millions rogi management calculation rogi gaap based calculation gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income taxes depreciation and amortization maintenance capital expenditures gross cash flow gross investment return on gross investment the rogi calculation for management measurement purposes uses a tax rate of percent 
the gaap rate is based on actual tax expense including any one time  discrete items 
maintenance capital expenditures used for the management calculation of rogi is percent of total depreciation expense whereas the gaap based amount is the actual capital expenditures from the cash flow statement 
summary of cash flows cash flows from operating activities in millions net cash provided by operating activities net income was million in  million in and million in changes in net working capital trade receivables  inventory and accounts payable accounted for a source of cash of million in  and a use of cash of and million in and  respectively 
the reduced sales and purchasing activity due to the slow economy and our focus on working capital management have both yielded positive cash flow results 
following is an assessment of each of the net working capital components trade receivables  net changes resulted in a million source of cash in as compared to an million use of cash in and a source in the lower sales activity was the primary reason for the decrease in trade receivables 
the dso was days at november   days at november  and days at december  inventory decreases in inventory resulted in a million source of cash in as compared to a use of cash of million in both and inventory days on hand were days at the end of as compared to days and days at the end of and respectively 
the improvement in 
table of contents days on hand resulted from various initiatives such as the realignment of manufacturing facilities in north america  inventory reduction programs in our latin america operations and an overall emphasis on managing cash flow through a difficult economy 
lower raw material prices also contributed to the decrease in inventory in compared to trade payables changes in trade payable resulted in a use of cash of million  million and million in  and respectively 
the majority of the million use of cash in was recorded in the first quarter as year end trade payable balances were paid but new inventory was not being purchased at the same rate due to the depressed economy 
also  the year end inventories were at higher prices than the prices being recorded for new inventory during contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the funding was related to our decision to fund our us and german defined benefit pension plans 
this resulted in million in contributions to the us plan and million to the german plan 
these contributions brought both plans to essentially a fully funded status at november  and enabled us to avoid a large increase in pension expense in the funding of our pension plans also contributed to the deferred income tax source of cash of million in compared to a use of cash of million in and a source of cash of million in changes in accrued compensation resulted in a source of cash of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and a decrease of million in accruals for variable compensation in were higher than the accruals for the same period in  a direct result of the improvement in financial performance in as compared to cash flows from investing activities in millions net cash used in investing activities purchases of property plant and equipment were million in as compared to million in and million in the amount of capital spending correlates to our belief that we have the correct production capacity in place for current and ongoing operations

forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could including the negative or variations thereof and other expressions that indicate future events and trends 
these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  our plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  item a

in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we have identified these important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
these factors should be considered  together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the list of important factors in item a

this disclosure  including that under outlook and forward looking statements and risk factors  and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by us in this report and elsewhere from time to time  represents our best judgment as of the date the information is given 
we do not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further public company disclosures such as in filings with the sec or in our press releases on related subjects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by the unfavorable economic conditions 
continued or further recessionary economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to the recession in the domestic and international economies  or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
we believe that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on interest expense of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of november  would be approximately million 

table of contents foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial condition 
approximately percent of net revenue was generated outside of the united states in principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound sterling  japanese yen  argentine peso  brazilian real  costa rican colones  chinese renminbi and honduran lempira 
our objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
we enter into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
we take steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results and foreign currency balance sheet positions as of november   a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
we generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  unplanned supplier production outages may lead to strained supply demand situations for several key raw materials such as ethylene and propylene  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
the purchase of raw materials is our largest expenditure 
our objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both our quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
