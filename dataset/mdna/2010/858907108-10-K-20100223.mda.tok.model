overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provides insight into important areas of management s focus 
this introduction highlights selected information in this report and may not contain all of the information that is important to you 
for a more complete understanding of trends  events  commitments  liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting estimates  you should carefully read this entire report 
during  we experienced one of the worst recessions that this country has seen  and as such  our results have been directly impacted by higher nonperforming assets and increased credit costs through elevated provisions and loan losses 
further negatively impacting our year end results were historically low interest rates and low loan demand  both placing pressure on our net interest margin 
highlights for include a strong period end deposit growth of over the prior year 
we decreased our period end loan to deposit ratio from at december   to at december  in addition  during  we continued to diligently analyze our loan portfolio and aggressively place loans on nonperforming status when appropriate 
we increased our period end allowance for credit losses to period end loans from at december   to at december  in  our focus will be serving the needs of our customers and managing risk and capital 
going forward  we will continue to actively identify negative trends within our portfolio  and take actions necessary to minimize future loan losses and strengthen our balance sheet and capital 
we will continue to position sterling bank for future growth and increased profitability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements various legislative and regulatory reforms have been proposed that may affect our operations in for example  on december   the us house of representatives approved the wall street reform and consumer protection act of hr 
some of the proposed changes contained in the hr include i amendments to the federal deposit insurance act to establish deposit assessments on total assets less tangible equity  rather than total deposits  ii provisions providing for shareholders of public companies to have a non binding say on pay vote  and iii the creation of a new federal regulator  the consumer financial protection agency  with enforcement authority for many of the statutes applicable to the financial products and services we offer our customers 
another provision of hr allows the fdic  as receiver  to reduce the amount of any secured claim by a maximum of percent to satisfy amounts owed to the united states or the dif during the resolution of the assets and liabilities of an insured depository institution 
this provision could increase the costs of borrowing and our interaction with our creditors 
it is widely expected that the us senate will present a financial regulatory reform bill in  although the exact scope of the provisions of that bill are not known at this time 
recent regulatory reforms proposed by our federal regulators include changes to the manner in which the fdic sets deposit insurance assessments 
the recent advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeks comments on the fdic s use of an insured depository institution s employee compensation programs as a factor in setting assessment rates for the institution 
we provide stock based compensation to some of our employees  which may be reviewed by the fdic in setting our assessment rates 
in the event that the fdic determines that our compensation program increases the risk profile of our institutions  we may face increased deposit assessments 
the president of the united states recently announced proposals that would limit the size of financial institutions as well as the scope of activities in which they may engage 
few details have been provided with respect to these proposals  and it is unlikely that we would be significantly impacted by the market concentration limitations given our relative size 
limitations on our ability to engage in proprietary trading operations may impact our business operations  however  additional guidance is expected regarding these reform proposals 
critical accounting policies an understanding of our accounting policies is important to an understanding of our reported results 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report of form k 
certain of our accounting policies are considered to be critical because they involve subjective judgment  estimation by management or are particularly complex in their nature 
fair value of financial instruments 
we determine the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level inputs include quoted market prices  where available 
if such quoted market prices are not available level inputs are used 
these inputs are based upon internally developed models that primarily use observable market based parameters 
level inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans and binding commitments 
losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of current economic 
table of contents 
index to financial statements conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectability of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond our control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses 
due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions made in this process  estimates of our loan portfolio s inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy  individual industries  and individual borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations 
the degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions 
key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include i risk ratings for pools of loans which are stratified by loan type  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loan type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and commercial real estate loans  iv loss rates used for each loan type  v adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  vi considerations regarding domestic economic uncertainty  and vii overall credit conditions 
the process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to at least an annual impairment test and more frequently if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 
other intangible assets consist primarily of core deposits and other intangibles 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized on an accelerated basis over the years expected to be benefited  which we believe is approximately years 
an intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset  indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
our annual evaluation is performed as of september of each year 
as a result of a decrease in the market price of our stock to a level below book value  we performed interim evaluations of our goodwill during the first and fourth quarters of the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
under the first step  goodwill is assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
reporting units used for the goodwill impairment test include our banking subsidiary  sterling bank  and mbm advisors a wholly owned subsidiary of sterling bank that provides investment advisory and pension administration consulting services 
the estimation of fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including the allocated goodwill 
at december   our goodwill totaled million of which million  or  was allocated to sterling bank 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the implied fair value of goodwill derived under step two is less than its carrying value 
to determine the fair value of the reporting units under step one of the impairment test  both an income approach and market approach was utilized 
the income approach was based on projected cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity 
value was then derived by present valuing the projected cash flows using an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate based on a market participant s cost of equity 
value under the market approach was based on applying various market capitalization pricing multiples  such as price to tangible book  price to earnings and other relevant metrics  observed from comparable companies 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to the reporting unit 
the results of the income and market approach were weighted to arrive at the final estimation of fair value for the reporting unit 
as the ability to identify truly comparable companies lessened given the fluctuations in market capitalization across the banking industry  we believed that a heavier weighting on the income approach was more appropriate during the fourth quarter of the aggregate fair values of the reporting units as determined under step one of the impairment test were compared to market capitalization as an assessment of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
for each of the impairment tests performed  the comparison between the aggregate fair values and market capitalization indicated an implied premium which was within the range of control premiums observed in the marketplace 
for the impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of  the sterling bank reporting unit did not pass the first step of the impairment test  and therefore  we conducted the second step of the impairment test 
the second step required a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill and was based on information that was as of november  to determine the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of sterling bank as determined in step one was allocated to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
key valuations were the assessment of core deposit and trade name intangible assets and the loan portfolio 
the valuation of the loan portfolio resulted in an overall discount which we believe was supported by transactions occurring in the marketplace and was consistent with the exit price principle of fair value 
the fair value of sterling bank s goodwill exceeded its carrying value by an estimated as of november   therefore  we determined there was no impairment of goodwill as of that date 
based on our annual goodwill impairment review at september   and our additional goodwill step two impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of  management does not believe any of our goodwill is impaired as of december  in light of the overall instability of the economy  the continued volatility in the financial markets  the downward pressure on bank stock prices and expectations of financial performance for the banking industry  including the reporting units  our estimates of fair value may be subject to change or adjustment and we may determine that goodwill impairment charges may be necessary 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons 
if management s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate  the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner 
if the company s market capitalization declines or remains below book value  the company may update its valuation analysis to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
no assurance can be given that goodwill will not be written down in future periods 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we may designate a derivative as either an accounting hedge of the fair value of a recognized fixed rate asset or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge or an accounting hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of future cash flows of a floating rate asset or liability cash flow hedge 
all derivatives are recorded as other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
to the extent a hedge is considered effective  changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
for all hedge relationships  ineffectiveness resulting from differences between the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and changes in fair value of the derivative are recognized as other income in the results of operations 
stock based compensation 
the company s stock based compensation policy applies to all forms of stock based compensation including stock options  restricted stock units  shares acquired under the employee stock purchase plan and performance based phantom units 
all stock based compensation is accounted for under the

index to financial statements fair value method as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the expense associated with stock based compensation is recognized over the vesting period of each individual arrangement 
the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock and phantom stock units is based on the fair value at the date of grant using the current market price on the grant date 
the fair value of each performance based share unit is estimated based on expected performance goals being attained 
compensation expense associated with the employee stock purchase plan is determined using a black scholes merton option pricing formula

net interest income 
net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including loans and securities  exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income

these securities are tied to underlying government guaranteed loans and are subject to prepayment and interest rate fluctuations 
given the length of time these securities had been in an unrealized loss position  current prepayment factors for the underlying loan and management s inability to determine when a full recovery of the value may occur  management considered these securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
there were no otti losses recorded in net losses on the sale of securities for of million were due to realized losses of million recorded on the sale of certain private label cmo s 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold five private label cmo s that were classified as held to maturity 
the decision to sell these securities in was due to the significant credit downgrading of the securities which caused these securities to be classified as substandard assets by management 
the credit rating on these securities declined from primarily aaa ratings in to credit ratings ranging from b to cc in throughout  we monitored these securities noting a significant decline in the credit ratings in under a year 
in addition  the underlying performance of these securities had continued to deteriorate as delinquencies continued to increase 
given these credit downgrades  the current economic uncertainty along with the increasing levels of delinquencies being reported for all residential mortgage loans  we believed there was additional risk associated with holding these securities until maturity

net losses and carrying costs on other real estate and foreclosed property was million for and thousand for losses on other real estate owned and foreclosed property during were due primarily to increased real estate foreclosures due to weaker economic conditions that have resulted in declines in property values 
other noninterest expense was million for  down million from this decrease can be attributed to our ongoing company wide expense reduction plan as we have identified additional ways to reduce expenses in areas within the bank  which include consolidating certain banking centers  cutting vendor costs  and eliminating unnecessary service agreements 
these actions are all part of building and maintaining a long term sustainable cost discipline throughout the entire organization 
other noninterest expense was million for  up million compared to this increase was due  in part  to three acquisitions completed since march of in addition  we incurred approximately thousand in hurricane ike related expenses during if current economic conditions continue or even worsen during  we expect that noninterest expense will increase as a result of net losses and carrying costs on other real estate owned and foreclosed property

index to financial statements during the fourth quarter of  the bank sold five private label cmo s that were classified as held to maturity resulting in a total realized loss of million 
the decision to sell these securities in was due to the significant credit downgrading of the securities which caused these securities to be classified as substandard assets by management 
the credit rating on these securities declined from primarily aaa ratings in to credit ratings ranging from b to cc in throughout  we monitored these securities noting a significant decline in the credit ratings in under a year 
in addition  the underlying performance of these securities had continued to deteriorate as delinquencies continued to increase

debt issuance costs of approximately million are being amortized over the ten year term of the notes on a straight line basis

under the terms of the swap agreement  we receive a fixed coupon rate of and pay a variable interest rate equal to the three month libor that is reset on a quarterly basis  plus 
this swap is designated as a fair value hedge that qualifies for the shortcut method of accounting

the unpaid principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest on the subordinated debt shall be due and payable on september  the bank may prepay the subordinated debt without penalty on any interest payment date on or after september  asset quality risk elements 
we have several systems and procedures in place to assist in managing the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in addition to established underwriting guidelines and approval processes  we monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
we also perform reviews of the loan portfolios on a regular basis to identify troubled loans and to assess their overall probability of collection 
ongoing portfolio reviews are conducted by our internal loan review department under an established loan review program 
we target a loan review penetration of at least annually of the total commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
through the loan review process  we maintain an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans on this list are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectability 
loans classified as substandard have clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize the loan s recoverability 
loans classified as doubtful have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur or that at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at 
table of contents 
index to financial statements present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or are on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
our classified loan list is also used to identify loans that are considered nonperforming 
nonperforming loans are loans which have been categorized by management as nonaccrual because collection of interest is doubtful 
our nonperforming and past due loans are substantially collateralized by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  we receive updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made within a short time following receipt of the appraisal to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
potential problem loans are substandard loans that are not considered nonperforming but where information known by management indicates that the borrower may be unable to comply with the present terms 
in cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulty but is current on their payments and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms  the loan is classified as a restructured accruing loan 
most restructured accruing loans are the result of providing certain borrowers a temporary reduction in their payments for a three to six month period 
these reductions are generally in the form of a partial or interest only payment 
we typically do not extend payment maturities  reduce interest rates or forgive principal or interest 
if management determines that it is in the best interest of the company and the borrower  it will restructure a loan that has already been classified as nonaccrual 
nonaccrual loans that are restructured remain on nonaccrual for a period of at least six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms 
however  performance prior to the restructuring  or significant events that coincide with the restructuring  are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual at the time of restructuring or after a shorter performance period 
if the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain  the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  we maintain a separate watch list which further aids in monitoring the loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements  deficiencies that require attention in the short run  or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit

excluding the semgroup relationship  nonaccrual loans increased million at december  compared to the largest of these loans is an million multi use land development loan that is not performing as agreed 
the increase in nonperforming assets during was due to weakness in most types of commercial real estate due to the slowdown in the economy

write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses 
real estate acquired by foreclosure was million at december   an increase of million compared to december  approximately  million of real estate acquired by foreclosure was related to commercial income producing property 
we expect to transition more nonperforming loans into foreclosed assets over the next few quarters as we should have continued success in gaining control of collateral through foreclosure and then selling the real estate 
potential problem loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in potential problem loans during is due to the efforts of our credit administration  loan 
table of contents 
index to financial statements review  and special assets groups as well as all of our lending personnel  to identify and remove problem credits from our portfolio 
the largest increase in potential problem loans is related to three borrowers with loans totaling million

these loans are commercial in nature and span a variety of industries 
these borrowers are all paying as agreed  however  weaknesses in these companies operating performance has caused heightened attention to these credits

restructured accruing loans were million at december  restructured accruing loans at december   included million of loans that were originated as part of our capital markets and sba group 
during  we have granted certain borrowers minor concessions in the form of temporary payment reductions 
we believe these payment reductions are a practical and customary business practice and can help a quality borrower get through a challenging time or difficult temporary situation 
these concessions better protect the bank s interests by improving the borrower s ability to repay its loan in full 
due to the prolonged economic downturn  we have determined that it is appropriate to report all modifications that result in even the slightest accommodation as a restructured loan 
accruing loans days past due or more were thousand and million at december  and  respectively 
the balance at december  consists primarily of two loans that were well secured and in the process of collection 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance consisting of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments 
it is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses and is reduced by net charge offs 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making our evaluation  we consider the industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
we also consider the results of recent regulatory examinations  our history of credit experience and our ongoing internal credit reviews 
the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses are determined based on the historical credit loss experience  changes in the loan portfolio  including size  mix and risk of the individual loans  and current economic conditions 
our allowance for credit losses consists of two components including a specific reserve on individual loans that are considered impaired and a component based upon probable but unidentified losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for purposes of computing specific loss components of the allowance  larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical credit loss experience for the respective loan type and internal risk ratings of the loans or loan pools 
we typically review all loans thousand and greater for individual impairment 
if an individually evaluated loan is considered impaired  a specific valuation allowance is allocated through an increase to the allowance for credit losses  if necessary  so that the loan is reported net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of the collateral 
impaired loans or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of a similar nature and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
the identification of loans that may be impaired is based on our loan review process whereby we maintain an internally classified loan list 
loans on this listing are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectability 
once a loan is classified  the loan is analyzed to determine if it is impaired and  if impaired  the need to specifically allocate a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses to

index to financial statements the loan 
additionally  loans restructured in a troubled debt restructuring are considered impaired 
loans are classified as troubled debt restructurings if we grant a concession for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s deteriorated financial position that we would not otherwise have granted 
if after review  a specific valuation allowance is not assigned to the loan  and the loan is not considered to be impaired  the loan is included with a pool of similar loans that is assigned a historical valuation allowance calculated based on historical loss experience 
the portion of the allowance for credit losses related to probable but unidentified losses inherent in the loan portfolio is based on a calculated historical loss ratio and certain qualitative risk factors 
we calculate the historical loss ratio for pools of similar loans with similar characteristics based on the proportion of actual charge offs experienced to the average loans in the pool 
these loan pools are divided by risk rating and loan type including commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans  consumer loans and family residential mortgages 
the historical loss ratios are updated quarterly based on actual charge off experience 
this historical loss ratio is then applied to the outstanding period end loan pools 
for years prior to  management used a twelve quarter loss period with a heavier weighting applied to the most recent four quarters 
due to the economic uncertainty during and increased charge offs  management now considers the latest five quarters to be the most relevant historical loss period for inclusion in the general allowance 
management expects to continue to use the latest five quarters as the most relevant historical loss period in and possibly beyond  until such time as management believes that economic conditions indicate that a different loss period is more relevant 
in addition to the calculated historical loss ratio  general valuation allowances are based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors 
the qualitative factors include  among other things i changes in lending policies and procedures  ii changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  iii changes in the nature and volume of the loan lease portfolio  iv changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff  v changes in the trend or the volume and severity of past due and classified loans leases  vi trends in the volume of nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  delinquencies and other loan lease modifications  vii changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors  viii the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and ix the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s current loan lease portfolio 
during  management increased these qualitative factors due to the significant and prolonged economic uncertainty

net charge offs were million or of average loans for compared to million or of average loans during beginning in the third quarter of  we took steps to significantly reduce our total nonperforming loans and increase our allowance for loan losses 
the actions included the charge off of certain collateral based nonperforming loans  the transfer of certain nonperforming loans to held for sale  and the charge off and subsequent sale of the semgroup relationship 
there were no loans outstanding to semgroup as of december  during the third quarter of  we recorded write downs of certain collateral based impaired loans to their underlying collateral value resulting in net charge offs of million 
additionally  during the third quarter of we transferred million in remaining net book value commercial real estate loans from the national sba commercial real estate portfolio to held for sale 
as a result of this transfer  we recorded an additional provision for loan losses and related charge offs of approximately million during the third quarter of to reflect these loans at their market value

as such  we recorded a charge off of million  the entire allowance for credit losses related to this loan 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell this loan

this sale was completed during the fourth quarter of the provision for credit losses was million for as compared to million for the increase in the provision for credit losses during was due in part to the previously discussed increase in charge offs of million

interest rate sensitivity we manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk  remaining mindful of the relationship between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies for the management of interest rate risk are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we measure interest rate risk using a variety of methodologies including  but not limited to  dynamic simulation analysis and static balance sheet rate shocks 
dynamic simulation analysis is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk and allows us to model the effects of non parallel movements in multiple yield curves  changes in borrower and depositor behaviors  changes in loan and deposit pricing  and changes in loan and deposit portfolio compositions and growth rates over a month horizon 
we utilize static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in these metrics from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change over a month horizon as of december  and changes in interest rates basis points increase decrease in net interest income december  base december  base each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
because of uncertainties related to customer behaviors  loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor behaviors  and socio economic factors that could affect the shape of the yield curve  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the affect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market factors 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us

additionally  during  we issued million shares of our common stock through a public stock offering  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering expenses 
in the current economic environment  we regularly assess our ability to maintain and build our regulatory capital levels 
in making this assessment  we take into account a variety of factors  including our views as to the duration of the recession and the consequent impact on our markets and the real estate market in particular  our provisioning for and charge off of nonperforming assets  the liquidity needs of our organization  the capital levels of our peer institutions  and our ability to access the capital markets 
we also take into account our discussions and agreements with the fdic and our other regulators 
as part of an informal agreement that sterling bank entered into on january   with the fdic and the texas department of banking  we have agreed to prepare and submit to such regulatory agencies a capital management plan that will reflect sterling bank s plans to maintain for the next three years minimum regulatory capital levels that are currently unspecified 
we intend to propose minimum capital levels in excess of the minimum requirements to remain well capitalized but below our regulatory capital levels at december   which  based on our discussions with the fdic  we believe will be acceptable to the fdic 
additionally  although not required to  we have agreed to provide the fdic and the texas department of banking advance notice of any dividend payments we would propose to make from sterling bank to sterling bancshares 
we currently have available at the holding company sufficient liquidity to continue our current dividend payments and meet all of our other holding company only obligations for approximately months without the payment of any dividends from sterling bank to sterling bancshares 
our informal agreement with the fdic and the texas department of banking also includes provisions requiring us to perform certain reviews of our personnel  policies  procedures and practices  none of which we believe will have a material impact on the operations of sterling bank or sterling bancshares 
if we are unable to maintain the regulatory capital levels that we propose in our capital management plan or if we fail to adequately resolve any other matters that any of our regulators may require us to address in the future  we could become subject to more stringent supervisory actions 
liquidity the objectives of our liquidity management are to maintain our ability to meet day to day deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to raise funds to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
we strive to manage a liquidity position sufficient to meet operating requirements while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the expectations of our shareholders 
in recent years  our liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in deposits including brokered certificates of deposit 
in addition to deposits  we have access to funds from correspondent banks and from the federal home loan bank  supplemented by amortizing securities and loan portfolios 
sterling bancshares must provide for its own liquidity and fund its own obligations 
the primary source of sterling bancshares revenues is from dividends declared by sterling bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to sterling bancshares 
as discussed above  we are in the process of developing a capital management plan that we will submit to our banking regulators 
that capital management plan will reflect a variety of operational factors including our plans for dividend payments from sterling bank to sterling bancshares and from sterling bancshares to our shareholders 
although not required to  we have agreed to give our regulators advance notice of any dividend payments we would propose to make from sterling bank to sterling bancshares 
sterling bancshares has sufficient liquidity to continue our current dividend payments and meet our other parent only obligations for months without the payment of any dividends from sterling bank
