the costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt and the mepp charges accounted for basis points of the decline in operating income margin 
net earnings per diluted share fell to in fiscal versus in the prior year 
the results reflect lower operating income as well as losses on the extinguishment of debt of million million after tax or per diluted share  partially offset by lower borrowing costs in the current fiscal year and a million or per diluted share income tax benefit associated with the reorganization of certain facilities within the all other operations business segment

gas and rent same store sales declined and hardgoods declined 
gas volumes for the current quarter were lower than the prior year quarter while pricing was down 
hardgoods volumes were lower than the prior year quarter while pricing was down  as declines in costs and prices for filler metals had the most significant impact on hardgoods pricing  with most other product lines stable to slightly down 
on a sequential basis  net sales increased from the quarter ended december  third quarter  driven by an incremental selling day and a sequential increase in daily sales 
strategic products account for about of revenues and include safety products  bulk  medical and specialty gases  as well as carbon dioxide and dry ice 
the company has identified these products as strategic because it believes they have good long term growth profiles relative to the company s core industrial gas and welding products due to favorable end customer markets  application development  increasing environmental regulation  strong cross selling opportunities or a combination thereof 
many of the strategic products are sold to customers whose growth profile tends to outperform gdp  including medical  life sciences  food processing and environmental markets 
while consolidated same store sales declined  strategic products increased on a same store sales basis in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter 
the company estimates same store sales growth based on a comparison of current period sales to prior period sales  adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures 
the pro forma adjustments consist of adding acquired sales to  or subtracting sales of divested operations from  sales reported in the prior period 
the table below reflects actual sales and does not include the pro forma adjustments used in calculating the same store sales metric

the distribution business segment gas and rent same store sales declined with volumes down and pricing down 
the decline in pricing was driven by lower costs related to both purchased and produced gases  increased price competition as well as some pricing decline in welder rentals 
hardgoods same store sales declined with both volumes and pricing each down 
the decline in pricing reflects a decline in costs and pricing for filler metals 
both gas and rent and hardgoods volumes were negatively impacted by the general slowdown in economic activity  but have shown sequential improvement 
on a sequential basis  distribution business segment sales increased from the third quarter  driven by a increase in sequential daily sales rates and an incremental selling day 
both gas and rent and hardgoods sales increased sequentially on a daily sales basis from the third quarter  with hardgoods up 
sales of strategic gas products sold through the distribution business segment increased compared to the prior year quarter 
among strategic products  bulk gas sales were up as sales of bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength  and bulk sales to industrial manufacturing customers continued to recover in the steel  auto and alternative energy customer segments 
sales of medical gases were up as a result of new business signings  partially offset by slowing in elective and non critical medical procedures 
sales of specialty gases were down driven primarily by a softening in demand in the chemical processing industry 
sales of core industrial gases  which experienced the sharpest volume declines  were down compared to the prior year quarter  with the related rental revenues down 
however  the company s rental welder business experienced a decline in same store sales as a result of sluggish construction activity 
mitigating the decline in distribution business segment hardgoods sales was an increase in safety products sales

the primary products manufactured and distributed are carbon dioxide  dry ice  nitrous oxide  ammonia and refrigerant gases 
the all other operations business segment sales decreased compared to the prior year quarter with a decline in same store sales partially offset by acquisitions 
positive same store sales in the carbon dioxide business were more than offset by declines in refrigerants and ammonia 
on a sequential basis  all other operations business segment sales increased from the third quarter  driven by an incremental selling day and a seasonal improvement in the refrigerants business offset somewhat by normal seasonal declines in the dry ice and carbon dioxide businesses  as well as lower ammonia pricing

after a significant run up in the costs of ammonia products in the first half of fiscal  ammonia costs from suppliers suddenly dropped in the fourth quarter of fiscal  while pricing to customers initially remained stable 
progressing through fiscal  pricing to customers has been under increasing pressure contributing to the same store sales decline  while the cost of ammonia from suppliers has been rising 
reduced carbon dioxide volumes reflect weakness in the beverage carbonation customer segment 
dry ice volumes were impacted by a decline in the airline services customer segment and strong prior year sales during the second quarter in the wake of major hurricanes 
refrigerants volume declined primarily due to mild summer weather in the eastern us along with customers deferral of hvac maintenance and conversion projects in light of the economic downturn

the fair value of the retained interest  which was million at march   is measured based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the receivables sold in which the company has a retained interest 
changes in the fair value are recognized as bad debt expense 
historically  bad debt expense reflected in the company s financial results has generally been in the range of to of sales 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  fair values of the retained interest are classified as level inputs on the fair value hierarchy because of the judgment required by management to determine the ultimate collectability of receivables 
the amounts ultimately collected on past due trade receivables are subject to numerous factors including general economic conditions  the condition of the receivable portfolio assumed in acquisitions  the financial condition of individual customers  and the terms of reorganization for accounts exiting bankruptcy 
the company monitors the credit risk associated with the aforementioned factors  as well as aging trends and historic collections and records additional bad debt expense when appropriate 
the company is exposed to the risk of loss for any uncollectable amounts associated with the subordinated retained interest in trade receivables sold 
interest rate swap agreements the company manages its exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the company s involvement with derivative instruments is limited to highly effective interest rate swap agreements used to manage well defined interest rate risk exposures 
the company monitors its positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties 
interest rate swap agreements are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company recognizes certain derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
at march   the company was party to a total of twelve interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company designates fixed interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of interest payments on variable rate debt associated with the company s credit facility 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedge transaction affects earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
during fiscal  eleven fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million matured 
at march   the company had seven fixed interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of million 
these swaps effectively convert million of variable interest rate debt associated with the company s credit facility to fixed rate debt

for the year ended march   the fair value of the liability for the fixed interest rate swap agreements increased and the company recorded a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million  or million after tax 

table of contents the company also has variable interest rate swap agreements  which are designated as fair value hedges 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings 
on march   the company entered into five variable interest rate swaps to effectively convert its million of fixed rate notes to variable rate debt 
at march   these swap agreements required the company to make variable interest payments based on a weighted average forward rate of and receive fixed interest payments from the counterparties based on a fixed rate of 
the maturity of these fair value swaps coincides with the maturity date of the company s notes in october through march   the fair value of the variable interest rate swaps decreased to a liability of thousand and was recorded in other non current liabilities 
the corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the notes caused by the hedged risk was thousand and was recorded in long term debt 
the company records the gain or loss on the hedged item the notes and the loss or gain on the variable interest rate swaps in interest expense 
accordingly  the ineffective portion of the hedge was thousand for fiscal and was reflected as additional interest expense 
at march  and  the company had no outstanding variable interest rate swaps 
the company measures the fair value of its interest rate swaps using observable market rates to calculate the forward yield curves used to determine expected cash flows for each interest rate swap agreement 
the discounted present values of the expected cash flows are calculated using the same forward yield curve 
the discount rate assumed in the fair value calculations is adjusted for non performance risk  dependent on the classification of the interest rate swap as an asset or liability 
if an interest rate swap is a liability  the company assesses the credit and non performance risk of airgas by determining an appropriate credit spread for entities with similar credit characteristics as the company 
if  however  an interest rate swap is in an asset position  a credit analysis of counterparties is performed assessing the credit and non performance risk based upon the pricing history of counterparty specific credit default swaps or credit spreads for entities with similar credit ratings to the counterparties 
the company does not believe it is at risk for non performance by its counterparties 
however  if an interest rate swap is in an asset position  the failure of one or more of its counterparties would result in an increase in interest expense and a reduction of earnings 
the company compares its fair value calculations to the fair values calculated by the counterparties for each swap agreement for reasonableness
