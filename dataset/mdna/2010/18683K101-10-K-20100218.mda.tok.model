item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cliffs natural resources inc traces its corporate history back to today  we are an international mining and natural resources company 
we are the largest producer of iron ore pellets in north america  a major supplier of direct shipping lump and fines iron ore out of australia  and a significant producer of metallurgical coal 
our company s operations are organized according to product category and geographic location north american iron ore  north american coal  asia pacific iron ore  asia pacific coal and latin american iron ore 
in north america  we operate six iron ore mines in michigan  minnesota and eastern canada  and two coking coal mine complexes located in west virginia and alabama 
our asia pacific operations are comprised of two iron ore mining complexes in western australia  serving the asian iron ore markets with direct shipping fines and lump ore  and a percent economic interest in sonoma  a coking and thermal coal mine located in queensland  australia 
in latin america  we have a percent interest in amap  a brazilian iron ore project 
over recent years  we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the world s largest and fastest growing steel markets 
however  the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets  which persisted throughout  coupled with the slowdown in the world s major economies  has had a significant impact on commodity prices and demand 
while showing signs of improvement during the second half of  global crude steel production  a significant driver of our business  was down approximately percent from  with even greater production declines in some areas  including north america 
consolidated revenues for decreased to billion  with net income per diluted share of 
this compares with revenues of billion and net income per diluted share of in in response to the economic downturn and its impact on the steel industry  we initiated and extended production curtailments at our north american mines during necessary to align output with lower demand and optimize inventory 
in asia pacific  the demand for steelmaking raw materials remained strong throughout the year primarily led by demand from china 
despite the absence of benchmark price settlements in china  we negotiated final pricing arrangements consistent with agreed upon price declines reached between asia pacific steelmakers outside of china and producers in australia 
results for were favorably impacted by the rise in the australian dollar to an exchange rate of a at december   resulting in million of unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts during the year 
throughout  we took proactive measures in response to the high degrees of uncertainty within our industry and the macroeconomic environment as well as to better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities when the market improved 
in  we also continued to focus on cash conservation and generation from our business operations as well as reduction of discretionary capital expenditures  in order to ensure we were positioned to face the challenges and uncertainties associated with the current environment 
these actions have allowed us to weather the financial crisis and continue to pursue our strategic plan 
segments we organize our business according to product category and geographic location north american iron ore  north american coal  asia pacific iron ore  asia pacific coal and latin american iron ore 
the asia pacific coal and latin american iron ore operating segments do not meet the criteria for reportable segments 
all north american business segments are headquartered in cleveland  ohio 
our asia pacific headquarters is located in perth  australia  and our latin american headquarters is located in rio de janeiro  brazil 
see note segment reporting for further information 
growth strategy and strategic transactions while maintaining a disciplined approach to our operating activities given the current economic environment  we continue to identify opportunities to grow and at the same time position ourselves to address any uncertainties that lie ahead 
we expect to continue increasing our operating scale and presence as an 
table of contents international mining and natural resources company by expanding both geographically and through the minerals we mine and market 
our growth in north america combined with our investments in australia and latin america  as well as acquisitions in minerals outside of iron ore  such as metallurgical coal and chromite  illustrates the execution of this strategy 
we also expect to achieve growth through early involvement in exploration and development activities by partnering with junior mining companies  which provide us low cost entry points for potentially significant reserve additions 
in  we established a global exploration group  led by professional geologists who have the knowledge and experience to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations 
we continued our strategic growth and transformation to an international mining and natural resources company through the following transactions acquisition of freewest acquisition of remaining interest in wabush acquisition of additional interest in renewafuel establishment of a global exploration group refer to recent developments within item business  for additional information regarding each of these strategic transactions 
results of operations consolidated compared to the following is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for compared with in millions variance favorable unfavorable revenues from product sales and services cost of goods sold and operating expenses sales margin sales margin revenue from product sales and services sales revenue in declined billion  or percent from the decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower sales volumes related to our north american business operations as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets throughout much of  which led to production slowdowns in the north american steel industry  and in turn reduced demand for iron ore and metallurgical coal 
in addition  the global economic crisis resulted in a great deal of pressure from customers  particularly in china  for a roll back of the price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in we experienced a reduction in current year pricing at each of our business units  thereby contributing to lower revenue levels in as a result of the deteriorating market conditions that continued throughout much of  revenues related to our north american iron ore and coal segments decreased approximately million and million  respectively  compared with based upon the economic downturn and the resulting impact on demand  sales volumes in declined approximately percent at north american iron ore 
north american coal experienced a decrease in volume of percent year over year 
revenues in were also negatively impacted by base rate adjustments related to reductions in world pellet pricing and producer price indices referenced in certain of our north american iron ore contracts as well as the estimated decline in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our north american iron ore customers 

table of contents revenues from our asia pacific operations were negatively impacted by the decline in iron ore prices caused by lower demand for steel worldwide 
as a result  revenues at asia pacific iron ore in declined percent from the prior year 
pricing decreases in the current year contrast with settled price increases in of percent and percent for lump and fines  respectively 
the overall decline in current year revenue at asia pacific iron ore was partially offset by positive sales mix and a percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand from china 
refer to results of operations segment information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted revenue during the period 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was billion in  a decrease of million  or percent compared with the decrease is primarily attributable to lower costs at our north american business operations as a result of declines in sales volume and cost reductions during the year related to ongoing cash conservation efforts that have been reinforced in light of the economic environment 
costs were also favorably impacted in by approximately million related to favorable foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year 
in addition  year to date fuel and energy costs in our north american and asia pacific iron ore operations decreased approximately million from the overall decrease in cost of goods in was partially offset by idle expense of approximately million related to production curtailments in north america throughout the year 
in addition  costs in reflect the impact of the asia pacific iron ore and united taconite step acquisitions  which occurred in the second half of refer to results of operations segment information for additional information regarding the impact of specific factors that impacted our operating results during the period

additionally  we received all of tilden s production in therefore  the remaining venture partner at tilden was not required to pay us the resulting royalty for their share of tons mined and produced from the ore reserves owned by cliffs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense of million in compared with is primarily the result of an increased focus on cost reduction efforts due to the current economic conditions 
in particular  outside professional service and legal fees associated with the expansion of our business declined approximately million during the year 
additionally  employment costs were reduced by million primarily as a result of lower share based and incentive compensation 
expenses at our asia pacific iron ore segment were million higher in when compared with  reflecting an increased focus on marketing activities due to the weakening economic climate  as well as higher employment costs and outside professional

in addition  selling  general and administrative expense in the prior year was impacted by a charge in the first quarter of of approximately million in connection with a legal judgment 
on november   we announced the termination of the definitive merger agreement with alpha natural resources  inc  under which we would have acquired all outstanding shares of alpha 
both our board of directors and alpha s board of directors made the decision after considering various issues  including the current macroeconomic environment  uncertainty in the steel industry  shareholder dynamics  and the risks and costs of potential litigation 
considering these issues  each board determined that termination of the merger agreement was in the best interest of its equity holders 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we were required to pay alpha a million termination fee  which was financed through our revolving credit facility and paid in november as a result  million in termination fees and associated acquisition costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of upon termination of the definitive merger agreement 
in october  asia pacific iron ore completed the sale of its percent interest in the irvine island iron ore project to its joint venture partner  pluton resources limited pluton resources 
the consideration received consisted of a cash payment of approximately million and the issuance of million shares in pluton resources  all of which resulted in recognition of a gain on sale amounting to million 
our interest in pluton resources is approximately percent at december  the prior year gain on sale of assets of million primarily related to the sale of cliffs synfuel corp 
synfuel  which was completed in june casualty recoveries in were primarily attributable to a million insurance recovery related to a electrical explosion at our united taconite facility

the decrease in interest income in compared with is attributable to a decline in interest bearing cash and investments held during the current year coupled with lower overall average returns 
investment returns in are lower as a result of market declines 
the slight decrease in interest expense in is primarily due to lower average interest rates on total debt outstanding of percent at december   compared with percent at december   partially offset by an increase in the period outstanding related to borrowings under our senior notes 
higher interest expense in also reflected interest accretion for the deferred payment related to the pinnoak acquisition 
see note debt and credit facilities for further information 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to declines in the fair value of our available for sale securities which we concluded were other than temporary 
as of december   our investments in polymet and golden west had fair values totaling million and million  respectively  compared with a cost of million and million  respectively 
the severity of the impairments in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments was consistent with the macroeconomic market and industry developments during however  we evaluated the near term prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and rapid decline in the fair value of each of these investments  and based upon that evaluation  we could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary primarily as a result of the global economic crisis and the corresponding uncertainties in the market 
as a result of acquiring the remaining interest in freewest effective january   results in the first quarter of will be impacted by approximately million of realized gains  which will be recognized in other income expense on the statement of operations for the period ended march  income taxes our tax rate is affected by recurring items  such as depletion and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earn in our various jurisdictions

such results consist of operating losses of million 
results in mainly consisted of operating losses of million  partially offset by foreign currency hedge gains of million 
the negative operating results in each year are primarily due to slower than anticipated ramp up of operations and product yields 
our equity share of the losses for amap were also higher in the current year due to a write down in the value of inventory  asset impairment charges  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates during and the resulting impact on project debt denominated in brazilian real

higher sales volume in was primarily due to increased demand and commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements  increased spot sales  and customer plant outages during the prior year 
however  this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets  which led to production slowdowns in the steel industry 
in addition  sales volume was negatively impacted throughout the year by adverse mining conditions and production delays at our north american coal segment 
results for north american coal in represent five months of operations since the july  acquisition 
revenues in related to our north american iron ore segment increased approximately million over primarily as a result of higher steel prices  renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers  which were negotiated at world pellet prices  and other contractual price adjustment factors

we subsequently made an off market offer to purchase the outstanding shares and proceeded with a compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares to obtain full ownership of asia pacific iron ore in the fourth quarter of the transaction constituted a step acquisition of a noncontrolling interest  thereby reducing noncontrolling interest in consolidated income on a prospective basis 
we accounted for the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest by the purchase method 
as a result of the step acquisition  the then historical cost basis of the noncontrolling interest balance was reduced to the extent of the percentage interest sold  and the increased ownership obtained was accounted for by increasing the entity s basis from historical cost to fair value for the portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the additional ownership acquired 

table of contents results of operations segment information our company is organized and managed according to product category and geographic location 
segment information reflects our strategic business units  which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition 
we evaluate segment performance based on sales margin  defined as revenues less cost of goods sold identifiable to each segment 
this measure of operating performance is an effective measurement as we focus on reducing production costs throughout the company

the customer claims that it is entitled to request a price renegotiation even though it did not provide written notice before the deadline specified in the supply agreement and did not show that the triggering event had occurred 
should the arbitration panel determine that the customer is permitted to request a price renegotiation  the two sides have days following notice per the supply agreement to negotiate revised pricing 
in the event these negotiations are unsuccessful  further arbitration would be utilized to determine the revised applicable price under the supply agreement 
the price determined by the arbitrator would be effective retroactive to the beginning of in the event this matter goes to supplementary arbitration to determine the revised price under the supply agreement  and we are unsuccessful in defending our position  the retroactive revised pricing for sales under the supply agreement would have a material impact on our consolidated operating results

the customer did not remit payment of this amount until january  as a result  such amounts are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
cost of goods sold and operating expense in decreased million or percent from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume  which resulted in cost reductions of approximately million 
the overall decrease was partially offset by idle expense of million related to production curtailments at nearly all of the north american iron ore mines during in order to balance production with anticipated sales demand 
in addition  cost of goods sold and operating expenses were unfavorably impacted in by approximately million due to higher cost rates 
the increase was primarily attributable to million of higher labor costs related to the new labor agreement entered into in september at our iron ore facilities as well as higher fringe rates combined with an increase of million related to higher energy costs 
this was partially offset by a million reduction in fuel costs  a decrease in royalty costs of million as a result of lower iron ore pellet pricing  and cost reductions of million related to ongoing cash conservation efforts during the current year 
in addition  due to lower partner demand  cliffs acquired million tons produced at tilden and wabush from the mine partners share at variable cost  which resulted in a favorable cost impact of approximately million in production following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for and in millions company share total mine empire tilden hibbing northshore united taconite wabush total long tons of pellets  pounds

in response to the economic downturn  we continue to rationalize production to match customer demand 
in  we reduced production at our six north american iron ore mines to million equity tons compared with production of million equity tons 
based on signs of marked improvements in customer demand beginning in the second half of  we have increased production at most of our facilities and have called employees back to work in order to ensure we are positioned to meet increases in demand 
during the fourth quarter of  tilden and united taconite began operating at full capacity 
northshore was operating its two large furnaces  and empire continued to maintain its current production levels 
wabush was operating two of its three furnaces with cliffs taking essentially all of the tonnage 
only hibbing continues to be fully curtailed and is expected to remain idled until the second quarter of based on current market uncertainties and corresponding blast furnace capacity utilization in north america  we continue to monitor the marketplace closely and will adjust our production plans for accordingly to meet customer demand

revenue of million in was percent lower than the prior year 
the decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a percent decline in sales volume as a result of market conditions which have adversely impacted the demand for steel making raw materials throughout the current year 
cost of goods sold and operating expense in decreased million or percent from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume  which resulted in cost reductions of approximately million 
the decrease in current year sales volume also resulted in a decline in freight costs of million and a reduction in royalty costs of million 
in addition  in response to the economic downturn  we decreased spending across the north american coal business segment and idled production at both the oak grove and pinnacle complexes during production curtailments and headcount reductions during the current year have resulted in lower production related costs  including maintenance  supplies  and labor costs 
headcount reductions resulted in labor and benefit cost reductions of million in spending on operating supplies and maintenance costs was reduced in by approximately million as we continued to focus on cash conservation and cost management strategies 
however  these cost reductions were more than offset by higher cost per ton rates in  due to the impact of lower volume  resulting in an overall unfavorable rate variance of million 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in were also negatively impacted by an increase in idle expense and production volume variance of million related to production curtailments at both mine locations during the year and delays associated with development of longwall panels at oak grove in early production following is a summary of coal production tonnage for and in thousands mine pinnacle complex oak grove total tons are short tons  pounds 
metallurgical coal demand has been reduced in the current year as the steel industry has cut back production in response to the global economic slowdown 
as a result  we initiated plans in to align production with customer demand 
in west virginia  production was idled at our green ridge mines for part of the year  and production at our pinnacle mine was temporarily suspended 
in alabama  operating levels were also reduced at our oak grove mine 
however  production levels began to increase at the end of due to improvements in 
table of contents market conditions and increases in customer demand 
in particular  during the fourth quarter  production increased at oak grove and development was also accelerated to avoid downtime in at pinnacle  the longwall move was completed and we resumed production in mid october 
these production adjustments at north american coal resulted in a annual operating rate of approximately million tons 
this compares with production of million tons 
the oak grove mine was recently idled due to ventilation  water and roofing issues at the mine 
msha denied our request to continue limited production while we addressed these issues 
oak grove continued to operate a continuous miner section to develop future longwall panels 
msha approval was finally received on february  for longwall operations to resume

pricing decreases in the current year of percent and percent for lump and fines  respectively  contrast with settled price increases in of percent and percent  respectively 
pricing in was based upon previously reported settlements in japan and worldwide pressures in the market and remained unchanged from the estimates we made throughout most of the overall decline in current year revenue was partially offset by a favorable variance of million due to a percent increase in sales volume as a result of increased demand as well as a positive sales mix variance of million due to more sales of lump and fines at higher prices and reduced sales of low grade fines 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in were relatively consistent with costs were unfavorably impacted by approximately million of amortization expense related to the accounting for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in asia pacific iron ore which occurred during the second half of costs in also increased by approximately million due to higher sales volumes as well as higher shipping costs of million due to freight arrangements with customers to secure sales during the current year

revenue per ton increased percent in primarily as a result of higher steel prices  renegotiated and new long term supply agreements with certain customers  which were negotiated at a time of higher world pellet prices  and other contractual price adjustment factors 
in  revenue included million related to the supplemental steel payments compared with million in the comparison of sales volume between and shows a slight increase year over year 
however  in  certain of our customers purchased and paid for approximately million tons of iron ore pellets in stockpiles at the end of the year in order to comply with the take or pay provisions of their existing long term supply agreements 
the customers requested via a fixed shipping schedule that we not ship the iron ore until the spring of  when the great lakes waterways re opened for shipping 
we recognized revenue on the million tons in the following represents a comparison of sales volume in  and as if the impact of the stockpile sales were excluded from the period reported and instead recognized in the period shipped in millions actual sales tons recognized cash received sales tons not recognized pro forma sales tons absent the impact of the stockpile sales  the increase in sales volume in is primarily due to increased demand during the first three quarters of  commitments under our long term pellet sales agreements  and customer plant outages during however  this increase was partially offset by declines in sales volumes to customers during the fourth quarter of as a result of the volatility and uncertainty in global markets  which led to production curtailments in the steel industry 
the increase in revenue is also attributable to a million favorable mark to market adjustment related to the unsold tons associated with our purchase of the remaining percent interest in united taconite 
the increase in cost of goods sold and operating expense in was primarily due to higher costs of production  higher royalty fees primarily related to the increases in pellet pricing  and increased maintenance

production following is a summary of iron ore production tonnage for and in millions company share total mine empire tilden hibbing northshore united taconite wabush total long tons of pellets  pounds 
the decrease in production at empire in compared with is primarily due to empire processing tilden ore to produce million tons of pellets under a test period 
the corresponding increase is reflected at tilden  bringing total production to million tons compared with million tons in the increase in hibbing s production in compared with was a result of the shutdown in late february due to severe weather conditions that caused significant buildup of ice in the basin supplying water to the processing facility 
the full year production loss in totaled approximately million tons company share million tons 
the increase in production in at northshore was due to reactivation of one of the furnaces at the end of march accordingly  production at northshore benefited from an incremental increase of approximately million tons in this increase was partially offset by production curtailments totaling million tons in the fourth quarter of from idling pellet furnaces in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry 
the increase in our share of production at united taconite is primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in july united taconite s production was reduced by million tons in the fourth quarter from idling a pellet furnace in response to production slowdowns in the steel industry 
in december  we executed plans to reduce production at our six north american iron ore mines

sales volume and costs in were negatively impacted by adverse mining conditions and production delays throughout the year 
in addition  we declared force majeure on customer shipments from our pinnacle mine in mid march production at the mine slowed as a result of encountering a fault area within the coal panel being mined at the time 
the force majeure was lifted in mid june despite completion of a longwall move in june  our oak grove mine continued to experience delays and lower than planned production levels during the second half of the mine encountered lower than planned coal heights in the current mining panel and harsh geological conditions in the development areas 
additional costs have also been incurred for repairs and maintenance as a result of mechanical problems caused by adverse geological conditions  delays associated with equipment replacements and availability of experienced mining personnel 
oak grove decreased production in the fourth quarter of to enable continuous miners to prepare longwall panels 
one of our green ridge facilities  located in the pinnacle complex shut down production in an effort to focus on mining the remaining other green ridge location  resulting in lower overall production for the facility 
we continued to be challenged with adverse geological conditions across the mines and delays in delivery of new capital equipment  which contributed to overall equipment performance and availability issues  which increased costs in all operations in production following is a summary of coal production tonnage for and in thousands twelve months five months ended december  mine pinnacle complex oak grove total tons are short tons  pounds

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in and million in operating cash flows in were impacted by lower operating results  as previously noted  and increases in working capital primarily at our north american iron ore business segment 
our operating cash flows vary with prices realized from iron ore and coal sales  production levels  production costs  cash payments for income taxes and interest  other working capital changes and other factors 
as a result of weak economic conditions  operating plans were revised earlier in to curtail production  defer or eliminate capital projects and reduce costs 
we have responded to the uncertain near term outlook and will continue to adjust our operating strategy as market conditions change 
beginning in the second half of  capacity utilization among steelmaking facilities in north america demonstrated ongoing improvement  which continued through the remainder of and is expected to continue into the industry is showing signs of stabilization and recovery based on increasing steel production and the restarting of blast furnaces in north america and europe 
as a result  we have experienced marked improvements in customer demand and market expectations and have increased production at most of our facilities 

table of contents while we do not expect demand to return to the levels seen in for some time  we remain cautiously optimistic for a slow and progressive recovery 
based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices  we expect estimated operating cash flows in to be greater than our budgeted investments and capital expenditures  expected debt payments  dividends  and other cash requirements

we received proceeds of million from the sale of the rail cars  and the leaseback has been accounted for as a capital lease 
aside from capital expenditures  significant investing activities in included million for the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in our asia pacific iron ore segment and million for the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in united taconite 
in addition  we received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  synfuel  in june non cash investing activities in included the issuance of million of unregistered common shares and the commitment to provide million tons of iron ore pellets as part of the consideration paid to acquire the remaining percent interest in united taconite 
non cash investing activities during the prior year also included the issuance of four million of our common shares at a share price of to the former owners of pinnoak to accelerate the deferred payment and settle the contingent earn out associated with the initial purchase agreement 
investing activities in primarily included the purchase of pinnoak as well as our investments in sonoma and amap 
the current volatility and uncertainty in global markets  coupled with the slowdown in the world s major economies  has had a significant impact on commodity prices in in addition  the credit environment is expected to limit the funding and expansion capabilities of many mining companies 
based on these economic conditions  we continue to evaluate and assess our capital expenditures  in order to ensure we are positioned to face the challenges  uncertainties  as well as opportunities  associated with the current environment 
we anticipate that total cash used for investments and capital expenditures in will be approximately million  including approximately million related to the funding of our investment in amap 
this amount does not include the additional investment to acquire the remaining interest in wabush  which is approximately million  subject to certain working capital adjustments 
as we continue to increase production and look toward continued recovery in  capital expenditures will include the construction of a new portal at oak grove to improve productivity and support growth and expansion of the mine 
at pinnacle  a new longwall plow system was purchased to reduce maintenance costs and increase production at the mine 
remaining expenditures for the new system of approximately million will be made throughout and in addition  based on signs of improving demand for iron ore pellets  we continue to perform studies to determine whether to resume a previously announced expansion project at our empire and tilden mines in michigan s upper peninsula 
furthermore  in we implemented a global exploration program  which is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on identifying and capturing new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations 
we expect to spend between million and million on exploration and development activities in  which will provide us with opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions globally 
we are evaluating funding options for our capital needs and expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations and availability under our borrowing arrangements

in  financing activities included borrowings under our revolving credit facility of approximately billion  partially offset by the repayment of million under our credit facility and million of pinnoak debt 

table of contents throughout we have implemented proactive initiatives to enhance financial flexibility and strengthen liquidity  including a public offering of our common shares  a percent reduction in our common share quarterly dividend to from for the second and third quarters of  and compensation reductions across the organization 
these initiatives were taken in response to the high degree of uncertainty within our industry and the macroeconomic environment as well as to better position ourselves to take advantage of possible opportunities when the market improves 
through the public offering of our common shares  which closed on may   we sold a total of million shares out of treasury stock 
net proceeds at a price of per share were approximately million  which will be used for general corporate purposes  including  among other things  funding certain capital expenditures  repayment of indebtedness or other strategic transactions 
in addition  the quarterly dividend and compensation reductions resulted in savings of approximately million and million  respectively  in capital resources we expect to fund our business obligations from available cash  current operations and borrowings under our credit facility

the combination of cash and the credit facility give us over billion in liquidity entering as previously noted under results of operations segment information  at the end of  one of our north american iron ore customers did not pay million that was due by december  under the terms of its supply agreement 
instead  the customer remitted payment of the full amount on january  as a result  this amount is not included in the million of cash on hand at december  we are party to financing arrangements under which we issue guarantees on behalf of certain of our unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in the event of non payment  we are obligated to make payment in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement 
at december  and  amap had total project debt outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively  for which we have provided a several guarantee on our percent share 
amap is currently in violation of certain operating and financial loan covenants contained in the debt agreements 
however  amap and its lenders have agreed to waive these covenants through may  related to the remaining debt outstanding 
if amap is unable to either 
table of contents renegotiate the terms of the debt agreements or obtain further extension of the compliance waivers  violation of the operating and financial loan covenants may result in the lenders calling the debt  thereby requiring us to recognize and repay our share of the debt in accordance with the provisions of the guarantee arrangement 
based on our current borrowing capacity and the actions we have taken in response to the global economic crisis to conserve cash  we have adequate liquidity and expect to fund our business obligations from available cash  current operations and borrowing under our current credit facilities 
other sources of funding may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements 
several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary 
the bank market may provide funding through a term loan or through exercising the million accordion in our credit facility 
the risk associated with this market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of decreasing capacity 
capacity  as in all debt markets  is a global issue that impacts the private placement market 
however  capacity in the bond market has rebounded for investment grade companies 
longer term debt arrangements at current corporate bond rates must be aligned with our longer term capital structure needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain agreements under which we have provided guarantees to an unconsolidated entity that are off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we have operating leases  which are primarily utilized for certain equipment and office space 
aside from this  we do not have any other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
refer to note commitments and contingencies for additional information regarding our guarantees 
market risks we are subject to a variety of risks  including those caused by changes in the market value of equity investments  changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have established policies and procedures to manage such risks  however  certain risks are beyond our control 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in australia  which could impact our financial condition 
foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
our asia pacific operations receive funds in united states currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in australian currency 
we use forward exchange contracts  call options  collar options and convertible collar options to hedge our foreign currency exposure for a portion of our sales receipts 
the primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in australian and united states currency exchange rates and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates 
at december   we had million of outstanding exchange rate contracts with varying maturity dates ranging from january to october a percent increase in the value of the australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value by approximately million  and a percent decrease would reduce the fair value by approximately million 
we may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our share of pellets produced at the wabush operation in canada represented approximately percent of our north american iron ore pellet production in this operation is subject to currency exchange fluctuations between the united states and canadian currency  however  we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation 
under the majority ownership of mmx  amap s functional currency was previously determined to be the brazilian real 
the change in control of amap to anglo in august resulted in the review of financial  operating and treasury policies of the entity under new management 
this  along with efforts to mitigate exposures related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in the reassessment of the accounting principles related to the determination of amap s functional currency during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents as a result  effective october   the functional currency of amap was changed from the local currency to the us dollar reporting currency primarily due to changes in the debt structure under which the entity is financed as well as changes in the treasury  risk mitigation and financial reporting policies under which the entity s operations are managed  resulting in the us dollar becoming the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates 
interest rate risk interest for borrowings under our credit facility is at a floating rate  dependent in part on the libor rate  which exposes us to the effects of interest rate changes 
based on million in outstanding term loans at december   with a floating interest rate and no corresponding fixed rate swap  a basis point change to the libor rate would result in a change of million to interest expense on an annual basis 
in october  we entered into a million fixed rate swap to convert a portion of this floating rate into a fixed rate 
the interest rate swap terminated in october based on the current interest rate environment and the mix of fixed and variable interest rates that apply to our outstanding debt  we have no plans at this time to replace the interest rate swap 
pricing risks the current global economic crisis has resulted in increasing downward pressure from customers  particularly in china  for a roll back of the price increases for seaborne iron ore and metallurgical coal in the record price increase was driven by high demand for iron ore and coking coal  global steel production at historically high levels  combined with production and logistics constraints for both iron ore and coking coal  resulting in tight supply conditions 
with the current global economic crisis  the market in some geographies  including north america  now is characterized by a reduction in steel demand with limited demand for iron ore and coking coal 
reduced demand for iron ore and coking coal has resulted in decreased demand for our products and decreasing prices  resulting in lower revenue levels in and decreasing margins as a result of decreased production  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
certain supply agreements with one north american iron ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnace 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative  which is finalized based on a future price  and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december   based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price 
we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
we have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations  nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future  however  certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars  which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year 
nonperformance and liquidity risks the current global economic crisis has adversely affected our business and could impact our financial results 
all of our customers have announced curtailments of production  which has adversely affected the demand for our iron ore and coal products 
continuation or worsening of the current economic conditions  a 
table of contents prolonged global  national or regional economic recession or other events that could produce major changes in demand patterns  could have a material adverse effect on our sales  margins  liquidity and profitability 
we are not able to predict the impact the current global economic crisis will have on our operations and the industry in general going forward 
in addition  consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers  some of which are highly leveraged 
these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk 
a significant adverse change in the financial and or credit position of a customer could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer and could limit our ability to collect receivables 
failure to receive payment from our customers for products that we have delivered could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our investment policy relating to short term investments is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the short term return through investment of available funds 
the carrying value of these investments approximates fair value on the reporting dates 
we commonly use aaa rated money market funds for short term investments 
all money market funds in which we invest have maintained daily cash redemptions throughout volatile energy and fuel costs the volatile cost of energy and supplies is an important issue affecting our production costs  primarily in relation to our iron ore operations 
recent trends have shown that although electric power  natural gas  and oil costs are declining  the direction and magnitude of short term changes are difficult to predict 
our consolidated north american iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas at an average delivered price of per mmbtu  and million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon in consumption of diesel fuel by our asia pacific operations was approximately million gallons for the same period 
our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels 
through  our north american iron ore mining ventures entered into forward contracts for certain commodities  primarily natural gas and diesel fuel  as a hedge against price volatility 
such contracts were in quantities expected to be delivered and used in the production process 
as of december   all of our hedge contracts have matured 
at the present time we have no specific plans to enter into further hedging activity for and beyond and do not plan to enter into any new forward contracts for natural gas or diesel fuel in the near term 
we will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed appropriate by management 
assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term  a percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately million in our annual fuel and energy costs based on expected consumption in supply concentration risks many of our mines are dependent on one source for electric power and for natural gas 
a significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could materially impact our production costs  margins and profitability 
as an example  wepco  the sole supplier of electric power to our tilden and empire mines  has filed a rate case with the michigan public utilities commission requesting a percent increase in rates from its rate payers  including our empire and tilden mines 
if wepco is successful in effectuating the percent rate increase currently being proposed  our estimated energy costs at tilden and empire in may be unfavorably impacted by approximately million 
uncertainties of proposed tax reform legislation in  significant proposed changes to us income tax rules were announced as part of the obama administration s budget proposals 
the proposed changes that could have a significant impact include the deferral of certain us income tax deductions related to foreign operations  repeal of lifo inventory accounting  
table of contents and elimination of certain current tax incentives for the coal industry  such as percentage depletion 
these changes  if enacted  may reduce the competitive position of many us businesses across all industries 
the impact of the proposed changes on our business operations and financial statements remains uncertain 
however  as the possibility of enactment progresses  we will continue to monitor current developments and assess the potential implications of these tax law changes on our business 
outlook we expect continued stabilization of the macroeconomic environment throughout and corresponding improvements for steelmaking raw material demand 
annual price settlements for iron ore products in are not yet concluded 
as such  we are using the following assumptions  based on an average of widely published industry analyst estimates  to provide expectations for our iron ore businesses  which use the settlement prices as factors in determining individual customer pricing 
any deviation from the following assumptions will impact average realized price increases of percent for world blast furnace iron ore pellet price settlements  increases of percent and percent  respectively  for australian lump and fines benchmark price settlements  and  north america hard coking coal prices of per short ton fob mine based on the above assumptions  the following table provides a summary of our guidance for our three reportable business segments  including further detail below outlook summary north american iron ore north american coal asia pacific iron ore current outlook previous outlook current outlook previous outlook current outlook previous outlook sales volume million tons tonnes revenue per ton tonne cost per ton tonne north american iron ore outlook for  we are increasing our sales volume expectations to approximately million tons  up from a previous expectation of million tons due to improving demand from customers 
we used a number of widely published analyst estimates  which call for an average percent increase in blast furnace pellet pricing settlements  in providing guidance on average revenue per ton in our north american iron ore business segment 
applying this assumption  along with a range for hot band steel pricing of to per ton and no inflation for any other factors contained in our current supply agreements  we expect revenue per ton in north american iron ore to be to this expectation also considers the contractual base price changes  lag year adjustments and pricing caps and floors contained in our north american iron ore supply agreements 
actual realized average revenue per ton will ultimately depend on sales volume levels and customer mix  blast furnace pellet price settlements  production input costs and or steel prices  all of which are factors in the our formula based pricing for the north american iron ore business segment 
in addition  the following approximate sensitivities would impact our actual realized price for every percent change from the above average analyst expectation for blast furnace pellet price settlements  we would expect our average realized revenue per ton in north american iron ore to change by to for every change from the estimated hot rolled steel prices noted above  we would expect our average revenue per ton in north american iron ore to change by 

table of contents we expect production of approximately million tons in our north american iron ore business segment 
at this level of production  cost per ton is expected to be between and and includes a per ton benefit from increased volume  offset by increased costs related to the acquisition of wabush  and increases in labor costs as well as maintenance spending that was deferred in north american coal outlook in our north american coal business segment  we are increasing our sales volume expectations to approximately million tons  up from a previous expectation of million tons 
we begin with approximately million tons of coal under contractual obligation  or approximately percent of our current annual production guidance 
this coal is priced at an average of per ton  which includes production earmarks to fulfill obligations for international contracts ending march  approximately percent of our production volume is committed  but not yet priced  as benchmark pricing has not yet settled 
we currently expect to sell the remaining percent of uncommitted production on a spot basis throughout the year 
in  we expect cost per ton for the year to be approximately to  with approximately per ton comprised of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
asia pacific iron ore outlook asia pacific iron ore sales volume is expected to be million tonnes  with production of million tonnes 
with annual price settlements for iron ore in not yet concluded  as noted above  we used an average industry analyst estimated increase for australian lump and fines benchmark price settlements of percent and percent  respectively  in providing guidance on average revenue per ton in our asia pacific iron ore business segment

recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingencies 
management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience  which are believed to be reasonable  however  due to the inherent nature of estimates  actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition north american iron ore customer supply agreements most of our north american iron ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors  some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year 
the base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract 
the inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply contracts and vary based on the agreement but typically include adjustments based upon changes in international pellet prices  changes in specified producers price indices including those for all commodities  industrial commodities  energy and steel 
the pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner  with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment  although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement 
in most cases  these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold 
in these cases  we estimate the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available and adjust the estimate to actual when the information has been finalized 
with respect to international pellet prices  certain long term supply agreements reference the previous year s settled price  in which case  no estimate is required 
however  pricing in some of our supply agreements is based upon the international pellet price for the current year 
the period during which we must estimate changes in 
table of contents international pellet prices varies year to year based on the timing of final settlement 
historically  contract negotiations were completed and pricing settlements for the upcoming year were reached during the first quarter of the contract year  in which case an estimate was required only for a short period of time and was adjusted to actual prior to reporting first quarter results 
this was the case in as a result  the price adjustment provisions related to international pellet prices were essentially a fixed component of the purchase price for that contract year based upon the timing of settlement 
however  several instances have occurred in more recent years  including and  in which contract negotiations have been extended with settlement occurring later in the year 
information used in developing the estimate prior to settlement includes such factors as previous pricing settlements among other iron ore producers and consumers in the industry  current spot prices  market trends  publications and other industry information 
however  based on the timing of settlement  adjustments of our estimate to the actual international pellet price were not material in or as a result of having limited shipments to customers with these contract provisions during the first quarter of each respective year 
the producer price indices remain a provisional component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices 
the final indices referenced in certain of the north american iron ore supply contracts are typically not published by the us department of labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year 
historically  such adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of percent of north american iron ore s revenue for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended december   and in addition  certain supply agreements with one customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnaces 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as an embedded derivative  which is finalized based on a future price  and is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december   based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price 

table of contents the customer s average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year  once the average annual price has been finalized 
as a result  we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year 
information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer  current spot prices  third party analyst forecasts  publications and other industry information 
the accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customer s ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year 
the following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during  and prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year hot band steel price estimate vs 
actual final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
benchmark pricing provision certain supply agreements primarily with our asia pacific iron ore customers provide for revenue or refunds based on the ultimate settlement of annual international benchmark pricing for lump and fines 
as a result of the derivative accounting treatment applied to these provisions  revenue reflects the estimated benchmark price until final settlement occurs 
therefore  to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis  an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing 
accordingly  in times of rising iron ore prices  our revenues benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at the current benchmark price and also from an increase related to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods  in times of falling iron ore prices  the opposite occurs 
pricing estimates are primarily based upon reported price settlements in the industry and worldwide pressures in the market 
the following represents the historical accuracy of our benchmark price estimates as well as the impact on product revenues resulting from the difference between the estimated change in price and the actual change in price for each quarter during and prior to settlement 
in  benchmark prices settled prior to reporting first quarter results  therefore  no estimate was required 
benchmark price estimate vs 
actual first quarter second quarter third quarter first quarter customer geographic location final settled price decrease lump fines estimated price decrease lump fines revenue impact in millions estimated price decrease lump fines estimated price decrease lump fines final settled price increase lump fines estimated price increase lump fines revenue impact in millions japan n a n a china 
table of contents the benchmark prices referenced in our asia pacific iron ore contracts settled with japan in the second quarter of we agreed to final prices with our customers in china during the fourth quarter of in  cliffs used prices as a proxy for prices prior to settlement 
the benchmark prices referenced in our asia pacific iron ore contracts settled in the second quarter of the impact on product revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price was recorded in the second quarter of each respective year 
the derivative instrument was settled during the fourth quarter of upon settlement of the pricing provisions with each of our customers  which reflected pricing decreases of percent and percent for lump and fines  respectively 
the settlement was consistent with previously reported price settlements in japan as well as with our most recent estimates used for reporting revenue throughout the year 
as a result  settlement of the pricing provisions referenced in certain of our asia pacific iron ore customer supply agreements did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  refer to note derivative instruments and hedging activities  for further information 
mineral reserves we regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with sec industry guide the estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions  geological conditions and ongoing mine planning 
maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures 
generally as mining operations progress  haul lengths and lifts increase 
alternatively  changes in economic conditions  or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves 
technological progress could alleviate such factors  or increase capacity of mineral reserves 
we use our mineral reserve estimates combined with our estimated annual production levels  to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
since the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation  a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation 
we also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets 
decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items 
asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation costs the accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations 
our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider ie  inflation  overhead and profit  which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates  and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives 
the closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves  which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves 
the estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates 
changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements  available technology  inflation  overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations 
we have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration 
our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site 
if the obligation can only be estimated as a 
table of contents range of possible amounts  with no specific amount being more likely  the minimum of the range is accrued 
management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required 
the characteristics of environmental remediation obligations  where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available  and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements  result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature 
expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated 
potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions required significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
our losses in certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
goodwill and asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  including among other things  estimates related to pricing  volume and reserves 
the fair value of goodwill is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 

table of contents we monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired 
we determine impairment based on the asset s ability to generate cash flow greater than its carrying value  utilizing an undiscounted probability weighted analysis 
if the analysis indicates the asset is impaired  the carrying value is adjusted to fair value 
fair value can be determined using a market approach  income approach or cost approach 
the impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves  future iron ore prices and production costs 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter each year 
in addition to the annual impairment test required under us gaap  we assessed whether events or circumstances occurred that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
based on the assessment performed  we concluded that there were no such events or changes in circumstances during we determined that the fair value of the reporting units was in excess of our carrying value as of december   and that we did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
consequently  no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment 
employee retirement benefit obligations we offer defined benefit pension plans  defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits  to most employees in north america as part of a total compensation and benefits program 
this includes employees of pinnoak  who became employees of the company through the july acquisition 
we do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our asia pacific iron ore operations 
following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and opeb funding and expense for the years through in millions pension opeb funding expense funding expense estimated approximately million and million of the estimated expense for pension and opeb  respectively  relates to previously unrecognized losses reported in oci 
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans primarily retiree healthcare benefits offered by the company are evaluated periodically by management 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the medical care cost trend  and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually 
we used a discount rate in of percent  compared with a discount rate of percent in we assumed a compensation increase of percent in and to determine both our pension and opeb obligations 
additionally  on december   we adopted the irs prescribed mortality tables separate pre retirement and postretirement to determine the expected life of our plan participants  replacing the irs static tables 
following are sensitivities on estimated pension and opeb expense of potential further changes in these key assumptions increase in expense in millions pension opeb decrease discount rate 
percent decrease return on assets percent increase medical trend rate percent n a 
table of contents changes in actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  employee retirement rates  mortality  compensation levels  plan asset investment performance  and healthcare costs  are determined by the company based on analyses of actual and expected factors 
changes in actuarial assumptions and or investment performance of plan assets can have a significant impact on our financial condition due to the magnitude of our retirement obligations
