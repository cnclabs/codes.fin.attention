item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables  unbilled revenues  accrual of the usf high cost area program subsidy  share based compensation  reserve for future customer credits  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  depreciable and amortizable lives of assets  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill  cable certificates and wireless licenses  our effective tax rate  purchase price allocations  the accrual of cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense cost of goods sold  depreciation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in item of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
the ongoing weakness in the national economy continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and spending 
there are some indicators that consumer confidence might be improving  however  there is no clear indication that the economy is in a recovery 
continued stress in the economy could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could i mpact our revenue growth 
we believe the alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time 
mortgage foreclosure rates in alaska are the lowest in the nation and the commercial real estate market is steady 
alaska appears to be relatively well positioned to weather recessionary pressures 
the state of alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the next two fiscal years 
this is important for alaska s economy as the state is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product 
the majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the alaska economy which appears relatively well positioned to weather the recessionary pressures  nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the economic crisis may have on us 
effective june   we purchased of the outstanding stock of uui and unicom 
the financial results of the long distance  local access and internet services sold to consumer and commercial customers of certain of these acquired companies are reported in the regulated operations segment 
the financial results of the long distance services sold to other common carrier customers and the managed broadband services components of certain of these acquired companies are included in the network access and managed broadband services segments  respectively 
effective july   we closed on our purchase of of the ownership interests of alaska wireless whose results are included in the consumer segment

year to date average monthly consumer wireless revenues divided by the average of consumer wireless subscribers at the beginning and ending of the period 
consumer segment revenues the increase in voice revenue is primarily due to a million or increase in recognized support from the usac and an increase in monthly recurring local service fee revenue 
the increase in usac support is primarily due to an fcc order issued in march  the result of which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands or alaska native regions retroactive to august the issuance of this order allowed us to recognize in  in additional usac support for services provided from august to december that is included in the revenue increase discussed above  and the removal of the cap allowed us to increase the usac support revenue that we recognized in the increase in monthly recurring local service fee revenue is due to increased subscribers 
the increase in voice revenue was partially offset by decreased long distance billable minutes carried 
the increase in video revenue is primarily due to the following a increase in programming services revenue to million in primarily resulting from an increase in digital programming tier subscribers in and a rate increase on certain cable service offerings beginning in august  and a increase in equipment rental revenue to million in primarily resulting from our customers increased use of our hd dvr converter boxes 
the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a increase in cable modem revenue to million due to increased subscribers and their selection of more value added features 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to the following an million or increase in recognized support from the usac primarily due to the following o increased wireless subscribers in areas that receive usac support  o recognition of million to be received from the usac for interstate common line support for a new local access area for which we received etc status in may of which million was related to services provided during collectability was not reasonably assured until we were awarded etc status  therefore  we deferred revenue recognition until such status was confirmed  o recognition of million upon a change in our estimate of support to be received from the usac for interstate common line support of which  was related to we accrue estimated program revenue quarterly and adjust our revenue as we obtain new information that changes the variables used to calculate our estimate  and o the fcc order issued in march  the result of which provides uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands or alaska native regions retroactive to august the issuance of this order allowed us to recognize  in additional usac support from august to december in that is included in the revenue increase discussed above 
an increase in the number of wireless subscribers 
the increase in wireless revenue was partially off set by receipt of million in july from the usac for retroactive interstate common line support at alaska digitel for which revenue was recognized in consumer segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of local access services dlps lines on our own facilities during and decreased voice minutes carried 
the video cost of goods sold increase is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers  increased rates paid to programmers  increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered over our hd dvr converter boxes due to the increased number of boxes in service  an increase in digital programming tier subscribers  and the recognition of a  liability in to settle a billing issue with a cable programmer 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities and the addition of more peering partners for internet traffic  which was partially offset by an increase in costs due to an increased number of cable modem subscribers 
the increase in wireless cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers and the inclusion of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs in certain promotions offered in the increase was partially offset by decreased costs due to the june  implementation of the new distribution agreement with at t mobility 
at t mobility acquired dobson  including its alaska properties  on november  in december we signed an agreement with at t mobility that provided for an orderly transition of our wireless customers from the dobson at t network in alaska to our wireless facilities that we began building in and are expected to be substantially completed in or the agreement required our customers to be on our wireless network by june   but allowed our customers to use the at t mobility network for roaming during the transition period 
we started transitioning our customers to our wireless facilities in november we successfully migrated all but customers from the at t mobility network to our network by the required transition date of june  the four ye ar transition period  which expires june   provides us adequate time to replace the dobson at t network in alaska with our own wireless facilities 
under the agreement  at t mobility s obligation to purchase network services from us terminated as of july  at t mobility provided us with a large block of wireless network usage at no charge to facilitate the transition of our customers to our facilities 
we will pay for usage in excess of that base transitional amount 
under the previous agreement with dobson  our margin was fixed 
under the new agreement with at t mobility  we will pay for usage in excess of the block of no charge minutes on a per minute basis 
the block of wireless network usage at no charge has substantially reduced our wireless product cost of goods sold beginning june  through december  we expect such reductions to continue through june consumer segment adjusted ebitda the increase in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in consumer segment revenues  which was partially offset by increased cost of goods sold as described above in consumer segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our consumer segment primarily due to an increase in the segment margin upon which the allocation is based

network access segment revenues the decrease in voice revenue is due in part to the june  implementation of the new distribution agreement with at t mobility as described in part ii item vii management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consumer segment cost of goods sold 
the voice revenue decrease also resulted from a decrease in our average rate per minute on billable minutes carried for our common carrier customers and the transition of voice traffic to dedicated networks 
the average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic and a interstate rate decrease mandated by federal law 
voice revenue continues to decline as expected due to increased competition in the network access business 
the increased competitio n will continue to compress the rates we may charge our customers and  therefore  we expect a continued decline in network access segment voice revenue 
the decrease in data revenue is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting in iru operating leases and service agreements replacing data network service agreements 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to increased roaming revenue in primarily due to the construction of our state wide gsm network starting in and the expansion of our cdma network 
network access segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to decreased long distance minutes carried and the movement of more traffic onto our network in lieu of carrying traffic on third party networks 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting in iru operating leases and service agreements replacing data network service agreements and a  favorable adjustment resulting from a refund of fiber repair costs 
the fiber repair costs were originally recognized in the first quarter of due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery of the fiber repair costs  we deferred recognition until collection of the refund was reasonably assured 
network access segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue as described above in network access segment revenues  which is partially off set by decreased cost of goods sold as described above in network access segment cost of goods sold and a decrease in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our network access segment primarily due to a decrease in the segment margin upon which the allocation is based

the increase in voice revenue was partially off set by decreased long distance subscribers and decreased voice minutes carried 
commercial segment data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on site customer support 
this latter category can vary significantly based on project activity

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in labor costs  million in additional expense resulting from our june   acquisition of uui and unicom  a million increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual in  million in additional expense incurred in for the conversion of our customers wireless phones to our facilities  and a million increase in lease related expense 
the increases were partially off set by the following a million decrease in contract labor costs  a million decrease in share based compensation expense primarily due to the reversal of expense properly recognized in previous periods for certain performance based stock options and restricted stock awards that are not expected to vest  and the absence of million to terminate a management agreement that was paid in upon the acquisition of our non controlling interest in alaska digitel 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to increases in revenue without a proportional increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the increase is partially off set by a million depreciation charge in to change the estimated useful life of certain assets that were decommissioned at the end of other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to the following a million decrease in capitalized interest in compared to million in additional interest expense resulting from the galaxy capital lease commencing in may  and a million increase in interest expense resulting from the write off of the original issue discount on our senior credit facility 
the interest expense increase is partially off set by the absence of a  loss that was recorded in relating to the fair value change on a derivative instrument 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to the increase in the amount of permanent differences in as compared to our pretax net income before income tax expense 
at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ended december   primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences in as compared to our net income before income tax expense

na not applicable regulated operations segment revenues we completed our acquisition of uui and unicom effective june  in connection with this acquisition  we recognized revenues of million from the acquired operations during with million recorded in the regulated operations segment and the remaining revenues recorded in the network access and managed broadband segments 
regulated operations segment cost of goods sold in connection with our acquisition of uui and unicom we recognized cost of goods sold of million during with million recorded in the regulated operations segment and the remaining cost of goods sold recorded in the network access and managed broadband segments 
regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda was million in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to consolidated income loss before income taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in labor costs  million in additional expense resulting from our june   acquisition of uui and unicom  a million increase in our share based compensation expense  million paid to terminate a management agreement upon the acquisition of our non controlling interest in alaska digitel  a million increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual in  a million increase in our facilities lease expense  and million in additional expense incurred in for the conversion of our customers wireless phones to our facilities 
the selling  general and administrative expenses increase is partially off set by a million decrease in bad debt expense primarily due to improvements in our collections of consumer accounts receivable 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in  primarily due to the net increases described above without a proportional increase in revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in  and a million depreciation charge in to reflect a decrease in the estimated useful life of certain assets decommissioned in effective january   we prospectively changed our accounting policy for recording depreciation on our property and equipment placed in service 
for assets placed in service on or after january   we are using a mid month convention to recognize depreciation expense 
previous to this change  we used the half year convention to recognize depreciation expense in the year an asset was placed in service  regardless of the month the property and equipment was placed in service 
we believe the mid month convention is preferable because it results in more precise recognition of depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the asset 
no retroactive adjustment has been made 
as a result of this accounting change  our reported amount of depreciation expense has decreased  our reported operating income has increased  and our reported net loss attributable to gci has decreased  our change in accounting policy would not have changed our reported basic or diluted eps attributable to gci in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in interest expense to million in due to a million increase in interest expense on our senior credit facility to million resulting from additional debt from the additional incremental term loan agreement beginning in may and the increased interest rate on our senior credit facility beginning may million in additional interest expense resulting from the galaxy capital lease commencing in may  a loss of  relating to the fair value change on derivative instruments  and  of additional interest expense as a result of our acquisition of uui in june the increases described above are partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest from million in to million in income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was in and multiple system operator mso operating statistics our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our consumer and commercial segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities 
the standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service utilizing our cable service facilities  encompassing voice  video  and data services  without regard to which services customers purchase 
at december   and we had   and  customer relationships  respectively 
the standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary analog video  digital video  high speed data  and telephony customers  not counting additional outlets 
at december   and we had   and  revenue generating units  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
our terra sw facilities expansion will be funded by a combination of loans and grants through rus 
should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
while our short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise  the continued turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms  which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 
we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our net cash flows provided by and used for operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows for and  are summarized as follows operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities is due primarily to the absence of million of cash received from iru capacity agreements that was recorded as long term deferred revenue in and a million increase in accounts receivable that is due to the timing of receipt of payments 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future 
a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed 
the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities is due primarily to a decrease in spending for property and equipment  including construction in progress in  and the absence of any business acquisitions in compared to capital expenditures our cash expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures decreased in primarily due to decreased investment in our wireless network 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress  to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during  and excluding our terra sw project 
we have an agreement with a customer to build out our cdma network to provide expanded roaming area coverage 
if we fail to meet the schedule  the customer has the right to terminate the agreement and we may be required to pay up to million as liquidated damages 
we expect to meet the deadlines imposed by the build out schedule and therefore expect our expenditures to result in an expansion of our wireless facilities rather than payment of the liquidated damages 
acquisitions we had no acquisitions in in  our acquisitions consisted of the purchase of uui and unicom for million  net of cash received  the purchase of the remaining minority interest in alaska digitel for million  and the purchase of alaska wireless for million 
in february  we made the final contingent payment of million for the alaska wireless acquisition  which was accrued in goodwill as of december  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from borrowings offset by our debt repayments and any repurchases of our common stock 
proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on the amounts paid for capital expenditures and to fund acquisitions 
we may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase our common stock depending on various factors  such as market conditions 
the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities is due primarily to reduced borrowing in available borrowings under senior credit facility as of december   we had a million revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
we have letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which leaves million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of december   if needed 
on january   we replaced our existing senior credit facility with a new senior credit facility that provides a million revolving credit facility and that extends the maturity through january debt covenants we are subject to covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our senior notes  senior credit facility  rus loans  and cobank loans 
we are in compliance with the covenants  and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business 
share repurchases gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of our common stock in order to reduce our outstanding shares of common stock 
under the buyback program we had made repurchases of million through december  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock in we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock pursuant to the buyback program during the years ended december  and in we retired  shares of our class a common stock  all of which were repurchased in pursuant to the buyback program 
we did not retire any shares in or that were repurchased pursuant to the buyback program 
schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations for long term debt included in the above table  we have included principal payments on our senior credit facility  senior notes  rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable 
we had no amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility at december   therefore  we estimated no future interest payments 
our senior notes require semi annual interest payments of million through february and our senior notes require semi annual interest payments of million through november our rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from to

purchase obligations include the following a non cancelable commitment to purchase hardware and software capable of providing wireless service to small markets in rural alaska of million  cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december   and a million contingent payment for alaska wireless made in february off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
new accounting standards fasb accounting standards update asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selli ng price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our income statement  financial position or cash flows 
asu addresses a revision to former sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas 
asu amends previous accounting related to the consolidation of variable interest entities vie to require an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity based on whether the entity has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
also  sfas no 
requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary  and amends the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
enhanced disclosur es are also required to provide information about an enterprise s involvement in a vie 
this statement will be effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our income statement  financial position or cash flows 
asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements requires new disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in subtopic the fasb s objective is to improve these disclosures and  thus  increase the transparency in financial reporting 
specifically  asu amends subtopic to now require that a a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and b in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately informat ion about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
in addition  asu clarifies the requirements of the following existing disclosures for purposes of reporting fair value measurement for each class of assets and liabilities  a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities  and a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our income statement  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are sign ificant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
revenue recognition the accounting estimates related to revenues from the high cost  rural health and schools and libraries usf programs are dependent on various inputs including current line counts  the most current rates paid to us  and our assessment of the impact of new fcc regulations  the potential outcome of fcc proceedings and the potential outcome of usac contract reviews 
some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and is subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods 
significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the likelihood that our customers will satisfactorily comply with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable certificates and wireless licenses are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment and quarterly evaluations of whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market p rices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations in cluding third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
our cable certificates  wireless licenses and goodwill assets are our only indefinite lived intangible assets and because of the significance of these assets to our consolidated balance sheet  our annual impairment analyses and quarterly evaluations of remaining useful lives are critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in market conditions or other externalities  or recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets for impairment testing purposes could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
adverse economic conditions have continued to impact the us financial markets 
should economic conditions in the state of alaska and other indicators deteriorate such that they impact our ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows  should our stock price and market capitalization decline below our book value for a sustained period of time  or should other events occur indicating the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets might be impaired  we would test our intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such asset s fair value 
any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
accruals for unbilled costs we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with alte rnative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory developments see part i item business regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our senior credit facility carries interest rate risk  however  we have no outstanding debt on our senior credit facility as of december  all of our material borrowings have a fixed interest rate
