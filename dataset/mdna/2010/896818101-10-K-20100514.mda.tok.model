item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer  manufacture and sell a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems for the global aerospace oem market  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
in march  we entered into definitive agreement to purchase vought 
vought is a leading global manufacturer of aerostructures for commercial  military and business jet aircraft 
products include fuselages  wings  empennages  nacelles and helicopter cabins 
vought s customer base is comprised of the leading global aerospace oems and over of their revenue is from sole source  long term contracts 
vought s revenues for the year ended december  were billion and they employed approximately  people 
financial highlights for the fiscal year ended march  include net sales for fiscal increased to billion 
operating income in fiscal increased to million 
net income for fiscal decreased to million 
backlog decreased over the prior year to billion 
for the fiscal year ended march   net sales totaled billion  a increase from fiscal year net sales of billion 
net income for fiscal year decreased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year as discussed in further detail below under results of operations  the decrease in net income is attributable to the write down of the carrying value of our discontinued operation to estimated fair value less cost to sell  as well as the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes due in november  offset by the contribution from recent acquisitions 
our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
we continue to remain focused on growing our core businesses as well as growing through strategic acquisitions 
our organic sales declined in fiscal due to major program delays  the dramatic decline in the regional and business jet markets due to the overall economy  lower passenger and freight traffic and airline inventory de stocking 
our company has an aggressive but selective acquisition approach that adds capabilities and increases our capacity for strong and consistent internal growth 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired fabritech  inc now triumph fabrications st 
louis and dcl avionics  inc now part of triumph instruments burbank  collectively  the fiscal acquisitions 
the results of triumph fabrications st 
louis are included in the company s aftermarket services segment from the date of acquisition 

table of contents in march  we acquired merritt tool company  inc now triumph structures east texas  saygrove defence aerospace group limited now triumph actuation motion control systems uk  the aviation segment of kongsberg automotive holdings asa now triumph controls u 
k and triumph controls germany and the mexmil company  llc now triumph insulation systems  collectively  the fiscal acquisitions 
the results for the fiscal acquisitions are included in the company s aerospace systems segment 
results of operations the following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations 
the company s diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results 
however  we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with recent securities and exchange commission the sec guidance on compliance and disclosure interpretations  we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our income from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the sec 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is income from continuing operations 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude from income from continuing operations the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss  income from continuing operations  or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss or income from continuing operations 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to income from continuing operations set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the sec and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the sec  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years expanding our product and service capabilities partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our operations  which included acquisitions  our income from continuing operations has included significant 
table of contents charges for depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for depreciation and amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our income from continuing operations to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to income from continuing operations amortization expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights and licenses 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of interest expense and other we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
the following table shows our ebitda reconciled to our income from continuing operations for the indicated periods in thousands fiscal year ended march  income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization interest expense and other gain on early extinguishment of debt income tax expense ebitda the fluctuations from period to period within the amounts of the components of the reconciliations above are discussed further below within results of operations

business segment performance we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group and ii triumph aftermarket services group 
our aerospace systems segment includes operating locations  and the aftermarket services segment includes operating 
table of contents locations at march  the results of operations between our operating segments vary due to differences in competitors  customers  extent of proprietary deliverables and performance 
for example  our aerospace systems segment generally includes proprietary products and or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers  where our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin 
also  oems are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties  and as a result  are less of a competitive force than in previous years 
in contrast  our aftermarket services segment provides mro services on components and accessories manufactured by third parties  with more diverse competition  including airlines  oems and other third party service providers 
in addition  variability in the timing and extent of customer requests performed in the aftermarket services segment can provide for greater volatility and less predictability in revenue and earnings than that experienced in the aerospace systems segment 
the aerospace systems segment consists of the company s operations which manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the aerospace systems segment s operations design and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems and components  main engine gearbox assemblies  accumulators and mechanical control cables 
the aerospace systems segment s revenues are also derived from stretch forming  die forming  milling  bonding  machining  welding and assembly and fabrication of various structural components used in aircraft wings  fuselages and other significant assemblies 
further  the segment s operations also design and manufacture composite assemblies for floor panels  environmental control system ducts  non structural cockpit components and thermal acoustic insulation systems 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment consists of the company s operations that provide maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  airframe and engine accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the aftermarket services segment s operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and flight control surfaces 
the aftermarket services segment s operations also perform repair and overhaul services and supply spare parts for various types of cockpit instruments and gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
we currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry  the military  the business jet and the regional airline industry 
our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries 
if any of these industries experiences a downturn  our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us 
the following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment

aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was due to a decline in global commercial air traffic and airline inventory de stocking resulting in lower demand for the repair and overhaul of auxiliary power units and the brokering of similar units 
aftermarket services segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  despite decreased sales volume as described above  operating income increased primarily due to charges recorded in the fiscal year ended march  for cost overruns and excess overhead at our phoenix apu operations  contract terminations and changes in estimate under power by the hour pbh contracts  offset by million in expenses incurred to shut down a service facility in austin  texas in fiscal while the results of our phoenix apu operations continue to improve  operating margins continued to be dilutive to the segment s results

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
during the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
cash flows from operations for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  from the fiscal year ended march  our cash flows from operations increased despite a decrease of million in net income  which included million in additional non cash charges for depreciation and amortization due to the fiscal acquisitions and million in impairment charges within discontinued operations during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in cash flows resulted from continued improvements in our inventory management resulting in a source of cash of million as compared to the use of cash of million in the prior year period 
on august   we amended the existing amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with our lenders to i increase the availability under the credit facility to million from million  ii extend the maturity date to january  and iii amend certain other terms and covenants 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility 
on march   no borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
amounts repaid under the credit facility may be reborrowed 
in november  the company issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes were sold at of principal amount for net proceeds of million  and have an effective interest rate of 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in cash in arrears on may and november of each year 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company incurred approximately million of costs  which were deferred and are being amortized on the effective interest method over the term of the notes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired fabritech  inc now triumph fabrications st 
louis and dcl avionics  inc now part of triumph instruments burbank  collectively the fiscal acquisitions 
the total cash paid at closing for the fiscal acquisitions of million was funded by cash from operations 
the fiscal acquisitions provide for deferred and contingent payments of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the contingent payments is million as of march  during the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
during the fiscal year ended march   our increased cash flow from operations was attributable to higher net income and an improved performance on working capital due to increased cash collections efforts  offset by timing of cash disbursements and utilization of inventory 
in august  we entered into a receivable securitization facility the securitization facility 
under the securitization facility  the company sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to triumph receivables  llc  a wholly owned special purpose entity  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions 
the company is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the securitization facility 
as of march   the maximum amount available under the securitization facility was million 
the securitization facility is due to expire in august and is subject to annual renewal through august interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee and a commitment fee 
the program fee is on the amount outstanding under the securitization facility 
additionally  the commitment fee is on of the maximum amount 
table of contents available under the securitization facility 
at march   there was million outstanding under the securitization facility included in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet  representing the minimum borrowing requirement 
we use this facility because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
the company securitizes its accounts receivable  which are generally non interest bearing  in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under the transfers and servicing topic of the asc 
the agreement governing the securitization facility contains restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the making of certain restricted payments  creation of certain liens  and certain corporate acts such as mergers  consolidations and the sale of substantially all assets

no in process research and development was attributed to the fiscal acquisitions 
the total cash paid at closing for the fiscal acquisitions of million was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
the fiscal acquisitions further provide for deferred payments of million  of which million and million are payable in march and september  respectively 
the fiscal acquisitions also provide for contingent payments of million  certain of which are contingent upon the achievement of specified earnings levels during the earnout period and another million that is contingent upon entering into a specific customer contract 
the maximum earnout amounts payable in respect of fiscal   and are million  million  million and million  respectively 
the contingent amounts have not been recorded as the contingencies have not been resolved and the consideration has not been paid 
also in march  we entered into a year master lease agreement the leasing facility creating a capital lease of certain existing property and equipment  resulting in net proceeds of  after deducting debt issuance costs of approximately the net proceeds from the leasing facility were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
the debt issuance costs have been recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the term of the leasing facility 
the leasing facility bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of per annum 
cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended march  was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   our increased cash flow from operations was attributable to higher net income offset by a decline in performance on working capital  due to timing of cash collections and utilization of inventory offset by timing of cash disbursements 
in february  we acquired the assets and business of b

the purchase agreement provides for an earnout note for million 
payments under the earnout note are contingent upon the achievement of certain earnings levels during the earnout period 
the maximum amounts payable in respect of fiscal  and  are million  million and million  respectively 
during february  we exercised existing authority to make stock repurchases and repurchased  shares of our outstanding shares under the program for an aggregate consideration of million  funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
in february  the company s board of directors then authorized an increase in our existing stock repurchase program by up to an additional  shares of our common stock 
as a result  as of may   we remain able to purchase an additional  shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time in open market 
table of contents transactions  block purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prevailing prices 
no time limit has been set for completion of the program 
on september   we issued million in convertible senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes are direct  unsecured  senior subordinated obligations of the company  and rank i junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  ii equal in right of payment with any other future senior subordinated indebtedness  and iii senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the notes of approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
the use of the net proceeds from the sale was for prepayment of our outstanding senior notes  including a make whole premium  fees and expenses in connection with the prepayment  and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
approximately million in debt issuance costs have been recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
debt issuance costs are being amortized over a period of five years 
effective april   we adopted the convertible debt accounting standard  which requires retrospective application 
the convertible debt accounting standard requires separately accounting for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest and amortization expense is recognized in subsequent periods 
the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount has been recognized as debt discount and amortized using the effective interest method 
this change in accounting for the notes has been applied to our consolidated financial statements on a retrospective basis  as required by the standard 
for more details on the impact of this change on our consolidated financial statements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of march   the remaining discount of million will be amortized on the effective interest method through october  the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable in cash semi annually in arrears on each april and october beginning april  during the period commencing on october  and ending on  but excluding  april  and each six month period from october to march or from april to september thereafter  the company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of a note for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
the contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal per annum calculated on the average trading price of a note for the relevant five trading day period 
this contingent interest feature represents an embedded derivative 
since it is in the control of the company to call the notes at any time after october   the value of the derivative was determined to be de minimis 
accordingly  no value has been assigned at issuance or at march  the notes mature on october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the company may redeem the notes for cash  either in whole or in part  anytime on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of redemption 
in addition  holders of the notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes on october   and  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to  but not including  the date of repurchase 
the notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a rate equal to shares per  principal amount of the notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment as described in the indenture 
upon conversion  the company will deliver to the holder surrendering the notes for conversion  for each 
table of contents  principal amount of notes  an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of  and the company s total conversion obligation and  to the extent that the company s total conversion obligation exceeds  at the company s election  cash or shares of the company s common stock in respect of the remainder 
the notes are eligible for conversion upon meeting certain conditions as provided in the indenture agreement 
for the periods from october  through december  and january  through march   the notes were eligible for conversion  however  during this period  none of the notes were converted 
to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  the average price of the company s common stock for the fiscal year must exceed the conversion price per share of 
the average price of the company s stock for the fiscal years ended march  and march  was and  respectively 
therefore  no additional shares were included in the diluted earnings per share calculations for those fiscal years 
the average price of the company s stock for the fiscal year ended march  was 
accordingly   additional shares were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
if the company undergoes a fundamental change  holders of the notes will have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
during fiscal  the company paid million to purchase million in principal on the notes  resulting in a reduction in the carrying amount of the notes of million and a gain on extinguishment of less than million 
during fiscal  we paid million to purchase million of principal on the convertible senior subordinated notes  resulting in a reduction in the carrying amount of the notes of million and a gain on early extinguishment of million 
the indentures under the company s debt agreements and the credit facility contain restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  issue stock options or warrants  make certain restricted payments and acquisitions  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell substantial portions of its assets and pay cash dividends 
additional covenants require compliance with financial tests  including leverage and interest coverage ratio 
at march   there were no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
at march   there were million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
the level of unused borrowing capacity under the company s revolving credit facility varies from time to time depending in part upon its compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement 
the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on specified levels of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and interest coverage requirements  and includes limitations on  among other things  liens  mergers  consolidations  sales of assets  and incurrence of debt 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of march   the company had borrowing capacity under the credit facility of million  after reductions for borrowings and letters of credit outstanding 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
during the same period  we anticipate approximately million of start up costs related to the mexican facility which is in addition to our investment in capital and infrastructure 

table of contents our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands debt principal debt interest operating leases contingent payments purchase obligations total included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at march   plus discounts on convertible senior subordinated notes and the notes of million and million  respectively  being amortized to expense through september and november  respectively 
includes fixed rate interest only 
includes unrecorded contingent payments in connection with the fiscal acquisitions 
the above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of million as of march  since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
the table also excludes our pension benefit obligations 
we made contributions to our union pension plans of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect to make contributions of million to our employee benefit plans during fiscal as of march   our defined benefit pension plans are frozen 
see note  employee benefit plans of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other employee benefit plans 
in march  we entered into definitive agreement to purchase vought from tc group carlyle for cash and stock consideration 
the purchase consideration to vought shareholders includes million of cash and  subject to certain adjustments  approximately million shares of our common stock 
the cash portion of the merger consideration is fixed 
the stock portion of the merger consideration will not be adjusted to reflect changes to triumph s stock price prior to closing of the merger 
the stock portion of the merger consideration will be decreased by approximately  shares for each day prior to july  that the merger is completed and increased by approximately  shares for each day after july  that the merger is completed 
the stock portion of the merger consideration will also be reduced for expenses of vought that triumph pays in connection with completing the merger 
we will also assume vought s debt  which was million as of march  the cash portion of the acquisition  as well as the repayment of vought s assumed debt is expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand  borrowing under our existing amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility and the issuance of senior notes in the capital markets 
in anticipation of the merger  we have obtained a commitment letter  which provides us up to billion in debt financing necessary to consummate the merger that may be used for funding in the event the transaction closes prior to obtaining permanent financing in the capital markets 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions and are continuously evaluating various 
table of contents acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions is successfully consummated  the availability under the credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
on may   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility  subject to the closing of the vought acquisition 
this revolving credit facility will be available to partially fund the vought acquisition and refinance any existing obligations under our existing credit facility  with a maturity date four years from the closing of the vought acquisition 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the aftermarket services segment provides repair and overhaul services  certain of which services are provided under long term power by the hour contracts 
the company applies the proportional performance method to recognize revenue under these contracts 
revenue is recognized over the contract period as units are delivered based on the relative fair value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration 
in estimating the total contract consideration  we evaluate the projected utilization of our customer s fleet over the term of the contract  in connection with the related estimated repair and overhaul servicing requirements to the fleet based on such utilization 
changes in utilization of the fleet by our customers  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require adjustments to our estimates of revenue to be realized 

table of contents reserves for contract losses are accrued when estimated costs to complete exceed expected future revenues 
the company s policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company s operating segments of aerospace systems and aftermarket services are also the reporting units under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the chief executive officer  president and chief operating officer and the chief financial officer comprise the company s chief operating decision maker codm 
the company s codm evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon review of segment information 
each of the operating segments is comprised of a number of operating units which are considered to be components under asc the operating units  for which discrete financial information exists  are aggregated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s acquisition strategy is to acquire companies that complement and enhance the capabilities of the operating segments of the company 
each acquisition is assigned to either the aerospace systems reporting unit or the aftermarket services reporting unit 
the goodwill that results from each acquisition is also assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition is allocated  because it is that reporting unit which is intended to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
asc requires a two step impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
our methodology for determining the fair value of a reporting unit includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the company s cost of capital  otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method dcf 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses 
factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses  the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development  the future cost structure of the businesses  and future technological changes 
the company also incorporated market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified 
in fiscal  we conducted additional sensitivity analysis to assess the risk for potential impairment based upon changes in the key assumptions in our goodwill valuation test 
we reviewed the aftermarket services reporting unit since it had significant changes in its economic indicators and 
table of contents adjusted for select changes in the risk adjusted discount rate to consider both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the reporting unit  expected long term growth rate and cash flow projections to determine if any decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a goodwill impairment 
based upon our additional analysis  it was determined that there was no impairment to be recognized  however  the fair value of our aftermarket services reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying amount  as the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
the amount of goodwill for our aftermarket services reporting unit amounted to million at march  going forward  we will continue to monitor the performance of this reporting unit in relation to the key assumptions in our analysis 
if management determines that impairment exists  the impairment will be recognized in the period in which it is identified 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred during the fiscal years ended march   or finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment 
when factors indicate that long lived assets  including intangible assets  should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets  including intangible assets  is used to measure recoverability 
some of the more important factors we consider include our financial performance relative to our expected and historical performance  significant changes in the way we manage our operations  negative events that have occurred  and negative industry and economic trends 
if any impairment is indicated  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  there were no reductions to the remaining useful lives and no write downs of long lived assets  including intangible assets  were required

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  including without limitation vought  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers  the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of vought as well as competitive factors relating to the 
table of contents aerospace industry 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us  see the risk factors described in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of march   approximately of our debt is fixed rate debt 
our financing policy states that we generally maintain between and of our debt as fixed rate debt 
we anticipate that our fixed rate debt may continue exceed of our total debt during fiscal in march  the company entered into a thirty nine month interest rate swap to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments to hedge against interest rate changes on million of the company s variable rate debt 
the company utilizes the swap to provide protection to meet actual exposures and does not speculate in derivatives 
the net effect of the spread between the floating rate day libor and the fixed rate will be reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in the period incurred 
in december  the company elected to de designate the interest rate swap as a hedge 
for the fiscal year ended march   million of losses were reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company estimates that million of losses presently in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings during fiscal year the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of notes to consolidated financial statements
