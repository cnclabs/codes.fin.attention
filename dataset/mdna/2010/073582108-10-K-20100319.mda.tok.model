item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of beacon federal bancorp  inc management of market risk 
strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
in our market areas  we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business  and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do  which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long term basis 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
if we must rais e interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans  our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected 
for additional information see item business competition 
we rely on our management team for the successful implementation of our business strategy 
our future success will be largely due to the efforts of our senior management team consisting of ross j 
prossner  president and chief executive officer  j 
david hammond  senior vice president and chief lending officer and darren t 
crossett  senior vice president and chief operating officer 
the loss of services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan 
we have entered into a three year employment agreement with mr 
prossner and two year employment agreements with messrs 
crossett and hammond 
our ability to successfully complete acquisitions will affect our ability to grow our franchise and compete effectively in our market areas 
we have pursued a policy of growth through acquisitions over the years  particularly in view of the slow or flat population growth in our primary market area in upstate new york 
since  we have acquired a total of ten credit unions 
in the future  we will consider the possible acquisition of other banks  thrifts  credit unions and other financial services companies or branches to supplement internal growth 
our efforts to acquire other financial institutions and financial service companies or branches may not be successful 
numerous potential acquirors exist for most acquisition candidates  creating intense competition  which affects the purchase price for which the institution can be acquired 
in many cases  our competitors have significantly greater resources than we have  and greater flexibility to structure the consideration for the transaction 
we also may not be the successful bidder in acquisition opportunities that we pursue due to the willingness or ability of other potential acquirors to propose a higher purchase price or more attractive terms and conditions than we are willing or able to propose 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in each of our market areas  although we currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other financial institutions 
the risks presented by the acquisition of other financial institutions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are successful in conducting acquisitions  we will be presented with many risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
an institution that we acquire may have unknown asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities that we did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process  thereby resulting in unanticipated losses 
the acquisition of other institutions also typically requires the integration of different corporate cultures  loan and deposit products  pricing strategies  data processing systems and other technologies  accounting  internal audit and financial reporting systems  operating systems and internal controls  marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution  in order to make the transaction economically advantageous 
 the integration process is complicated and time consuming  and could divert our attention from other business concerns and may be disruptive to our customers and the customers of the acquired institution 
our failure to successfully integrate an acquired institution could result in the loss of key customers and employees  and prevent us from achieving expected synergies and cost savings 
acquisitions also result in professional fees and may result in creating goodwill that could become impaired  thereby requiring us to recognize further charges 
we may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds  thereby increasing our leverage and reducing our liquidity  or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities
