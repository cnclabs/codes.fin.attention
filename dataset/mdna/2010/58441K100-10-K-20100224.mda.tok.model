item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion addresses the principal factors affecting the company s financial condition and operations during the past three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the five year financial summary found in item and item of this report 
overview the company is a diversified communications company located primarily in the southeastern united states and is committed to providing excellent local content in growth markets over multiple platforms  to continually developing new products and services that will stimulate audience and revenue growth  and to nurturing traditional audience viewership while harnessing the expanding opportunities presented by digital media 
effective at the beginning of the third quarter of  the company changed its management structure  shifting from its three division structure publishing  broadcast  and interactive media to five geographic segments virginia tennessee  florida  mid south which includes south carolina  georgia  alabama  and mississippi  north carolina  and ohio rhode island along with a sixth segment that includes interactive advertising services and certain other operations 
the company s three metropolitan newspapers  community newspapers  more than weekly newspapers and other targeted publications  network affiliated broadcast television stations  as well as all related web sites  are managed in the geographic region they serve 
the advertising services other segment primarily consists of the company s three growing interactive advertising services companies and certain other operations including a broadcast equipment and studio design company 
the company s mission of being the leading provider of high quality news  information and entertainment in the southeast by continually building its position of strength in strategically located markets was strengthened by its evolution to geographic based markets 
by combining its resources in a designated geographic market under one leader  a leaner more cohesive structure emerged which more closely connects the company to its customers and non customers  accelerates the company s digital strategy  and facilitates streamlined decision making 
the company continues to build upon its digital first approach to news reporting and content gathering  leveraging mobile and the internet as the immediate platforms for distribution of breaking news and positioning digital media in each of its markets for strong  long term audience growth 
additionally  the company continues to focus on cultivating key strategic partnership opportunities with established online brands such as yahoo and zillow  providing scalable paths to new audiences and to grow revenues 
the company also continues to invest in its emerging advertising services group made up of high growth businesses targeting social shopping and coupons  branded entertainment and advergames  and mobile marketing services 
while the signs of a weakening economy were noticeable toward the end of and more pronounced throughout the following year  ushered in nearly unprecedented economic turmoil 
in  the economic climate remained daunting with only small signs of recovery as the year progressed 
most companies  and particularly those in the media industry  were directly impacted by the resulting adverse effects on consumer confidence and related lower advertiser spending levels 
the company s florida market was the first of the company s markets to be significantly impacted  as a housing induced recession in florida which began in late served as an indicator of what was to follow throughout the country  unfortunately  the company s other markets ultimately felt the same effects 
the company responded to these economic indicators by sharply reducing its expenses to bring them in line with revenue expectations 
advertising sales comprise the majority of the company s revenues 
the distribution of advertising revenues in the united states continues to shift among numerous established media  as well as many new entrants  resulting in intense competition 
the company recognizes the impending challenges facing its geographic markets  not only from internet competition  but also from structural changes in industries that have historically been major purchasers of print advertising  from a floundering economy  and from the cyclical nature of certain advertising which translates into the relative absence of political and olympics advertising for television stations in odd numbered years 
while there is little that the company can do to influence the weak economy  to change the cyclical nature of odd numbered years  or to reduce competition  it can manage expenses accordingly  capitalize to the fullest extent on revenues in even numbered years  and implement strategic plans to garner its share of web based advertising 
the pace and intensity of a shift away from traditional print advertising is a concern  but the company remains vigilant in its efforts to maximize the potential of digital media revenue streams through product development and expansion 
while the ultimate role of digital media has yet to be fully revealed  the company believes it is poised to capture its share of digital opportunities 

table of contents the company is aware of certain pending climate change and other environmental laws and regulations that  if enacted or adopted  could impact the company by potentially increasing its operating costs through higher electricity and other expenses associated with its facilities and  possibly  by increasing the cost of newsprint  the company s most significant raw material 
climate change effects could include more intense tropical storms  tornadoes and hurricanes potentially causing lost revenue and higher expenses associated with storms because of the concentration of the company s operations in the southeastern united states  as discussed in item a of this form k 
subsequent to the end of  the company entered into a new financing structure by amending and extending its existing bank debt  and by issuing senior notes in a private placement 
these actions provide the company with greater financial flexibility and further strengthen its financial position over the long term even as it navigates the short term weak economy 
for a more detailed discussion surrounding these actions  see the liquidity section of this md a 
acquisitions and dispositions in  several plans were set in motion  which allowed for a substantial reduction in debt in  a renewed focus on the company s core business and a heightened focus on the expanding role of interactive media service companies 
in  the company purchased dealtaker 
com  an online social shopping portal that provides coupons and bargains to its users  and netinformer  a leading provider of mobile advertising and marketing services 
additionally  the company sold its one third ownership stake in sp newsprint company to white birch paper company 
the company sold four out of five tv stations and their associated web sites that were classified as held for sale in three transactions in including wtvq in lexington  kentucky  wmbb in panama city  florida  kalb nalb in alexandria  louisiana  and wneg in toccoa  georgia 
primarily as a result of proceeds generated from these divestitures  long term debt was reduced by more than million in in  the company completed the sale of the fifth held for sale station  wcwj in jacksonville  florida  and a small business magazine located in the virginia tennessee market  allowing for further long term debt reduction of approximately million in critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires that management make various estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if that estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and if changes in the estimate which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of the board of directors has reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates 
while actual results could differ from accounting estimates  the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas intangible assets the company reviews the carrying values of both goodwill and other identified intangible assets  including fcc licenses  in the fourth quarter each year  or earlier if events indicate impairment may have arisen  utilizing discounted cash flow models and market based models 
the preparation of discounted cash flow models requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue growth  compensation levels  newsprint prices  discount rates and market trading multiples for broadcast and newspaper assets 
the preparation of market based models requires the collection of estimated peer company data as to revenues and ebitda  as well as an assessment of enterprise values by looking at stock prices and debt levels 
these key assumptions for both the discounted cash flow and market based models work in concert with one another 
changes to one variable may necessitate changes to other variables 
as a result of a third quarter impairment test  there was a partial write off of goodwill at three reporting units within the mid south market  one reporting unit within the ohio rhode island market  one reporting unit within the virginia tennessee market and one reporting unit within the north carolina market 
all six of these reporting units are at risk of failing future goodwill tests because the fair value and carrying value were within close proximity as of the end of the third quarter of additionally  one reporting unit within the mid south market and one reporting 
table of contents unit within the north carolina market passed the third quarter of goodwill impairment test but are at risk of failing in the future as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value by less than as of september  in aggregate  there are four reporting units at risk within the mid south market with approximately million of allocated goodwill  one reporting unit at risk within the ohio rhode island market with approximately million of allocated goodwill  two reporting units at risk within the north carolina market with approximately million of allocated goodwill  and one reporting unit at risk within the virginia tennessee market with approximately million of allocated goodwill 
the key assumptions for all reporting units with at risk goodwill include those relating to revenue growth  compensation levels  newsprint prices  discount rates and market trading multiples for broadcast and newspaper assets 
since the estimated fair values that arise in both the discounted cash flow and market based models are subject to change based on the company s performance and stock prices  peer company performance and stock prices  overall market conditions  and the state of the credit markets  future impairment charges are possible 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the determination of the liabilities and cost of the company s pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and postretirement reporting are reviewed annually with independent actuaries and are compared with external benchmarks  historical trends  and the company s own experience to determine that its assumptions are reasonable 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates expected return on plan assets salary growth mortality rates health care cost trends retirement rates expected contributions a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in pension expense for of approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have raised or lowered the plans expense by less than million and would have changed the plans projected obligations by approximately to million as of the end of effective for fiscal  the company redesigned its defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans and also added certain new employee benefit programs 
the changes included freezing the service accrual in the defined benefit retirement plan for existing employees  closing this plan to new employees  increasing the maximum company match in the k defined contribution plan to from of an employee s earnings the entire match was suspended effective april   adding a profit sharing feature to the k plan  and establishing new retiree medical savings accounts 
in  the company took the final steps to fully freeze all benefits under its retirement plans 
the company took these steps to reduce the costs and volatility of future pension expense and contributions 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs  and automobile and general liability claims with specified stop loss provisions for high dollar claims 
the company estimates the liabilities for these items approximately million at december  based on historical experience and advice from actuaries and claim administrators 
actual claims experience as well as changes in health care cost trends could result in the company s eventual cost differing from this estimate 
income taxes the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is regularly audited by both federal and state tax agencies 
from time to time  those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various tax agencies and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of these audits 
the company adopted an accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions in the first quarter of this standard requires 
table of contents that income tax positions recognized in an entity s tax returns have a more likely than not chance of being sustained prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements 
if subsequent information becomes available that changes the more likely than not assessment of either a previously unrecognized or recognized tax benefit  the corresponding tax benefit or expense would be recorded in the period in which the information becomes available 
the company records income tax expense using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the differing treatments of various items of income and expense for financial reporting versus tax reporting purposes 
the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company ordinarily bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates as well as expected future income 
however  the company was in a net deferred tax asset position at the end of both and and  although the company fully expects to utilize the underlying tax benefits  it could not assume future taxable income due to a cumulative book loss in recent years the direct result of non cash intangible asset impairment charges 
the company therefore established a valuation allowance 
due to the requirements of accounting interpretations related to the company s amortization of intangible assets for income tax purposes  the company anticipates recording additional deferred tax valuation allowance of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
this additional valuation allowance will be recorded as a non cash charge to income tax expense 
an explanation of this additional valuation allowance as well as a description of the situation and events that would alter it are described more fully in note of item of this form k 
significant changes in enacted federal and state tax laws or in expected future earnings might impact income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the valuation allowance 
summary management believes  given current facts and circumstances  supplemented by the expertise and concurrence of external resources  including actuaries and accountants  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable and in accordance with gaap 
management further believes that the assumptions and estimates actually used in the financial statements  taken as a whole  represent the most appropriate choices from among reasonably possible alternatives and fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
management will continue to discuss key estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
results of operations net income the company recorded net losses of million per share and million per share in and  respectively  and net income of million 
per share in in order to facilitate a meaningful discussion of comparative results for the last three years  several items merit separate consideration 
the company recorded pretax impairment charges totaling million and million in and  respectively 
challenging business conditions and the market s perception of the value of media company stocks prompted the company to perform an interim impairment test as of the end of the second quarter in that resulted in an impairment charge in that quarter 
the company performed its annual impairment test at the beginning of the fourth quarter of with no additional impairment indicated 
however  business conditions worsened during the fourth quarter  and the market s perception of the value of media company stocks deteriorated further  resulting in an additional impairment at the end of as progressed  it became clear that the anticipated economic recovery would be delayed  leading the company to perform a second quarter interim impairment test  with no impairment indicated 
several developments in the third quarter of had relevance for purposes of impairment testing 
first  as previously mentioned  the company changed its structure from one organized by division to one organized primarily by geographic market 
at the same time  the company reallocated goodwill in accordance with this new market structure 
second  the market s perception of the value of media stocks rose considerably  which contributed to an increase of approximately million in the estimated total fair value of all of the company s reporting units 
third  there were signs of the economy bottoming out 
however  continued lackluster consumer spending in the third quarter of resulted in further advertising revenue erosion  and the company s expectation regarding a recovery in ad spending was delayed 
these factors  together with the more granular testing required by accounting standards as a result of the company s new reporting structure  resulted in a third quarter impairment charge 
for additional information regarding these impairment charges  see the note in item of this form k 

table of contents as previously mentioned  the company completed the sale of a fifth and final held for sale television station as well as a small business magazine in  the first four television stations were sold in the company recorded an after tax gain of million in  an after tax loss of million in  and an after tax loss of million in related to these divestitures 
results of the sold television stations and their related web sites and the business magazine have been reported as discontinued operations for all years presented 
see note of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s acquisitions and divestitures 
the company also consummated the sale of sp newsprint company spnc in the second quarter of and increased the year end  pretax  sale related costs and write downs it originally recorded in of approximately million by another million in based on the estimated value of certain post closing items 
in  a small adverse adjustment related to working capital was recognized as was a small favorable resolution of a retained liability for an income tax dispute at spnc 
the total pretax impact of the sp newsprint operations was income of 
million in and losses of million and million in and  respectively 
see note in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the spnc sale 
the remainder of this discussion focuses only on results from continuing operations 
in an effort to better align its costs with the soft current business environment  the company implemented various cost reduction plans  which included voluntary and non voluntary separation programs 
these workforce reductions were in response to a general economic downturn  and particularly to the deep housing induced recession in the florida market 
full time equivalent employees were reduced by approximately  employees at the close of  and by an additional employees by the close of to approximately  employees 
as the company trimmed its workforce  severance costs of million  million  and million were included in operating expenses for   and  respectively 
the company had a loss from continuing operations of million in as compared to a loss of million in  excluding the after tax effect of impairment charges in both periods  produced income from continuing operations of million  and resulted in a loss from continuing operations of million 
a significant aspect of this year over year improvement was a decrease in operating expenses  which more than offset an decrease in revenues 
revenues suffered declines in all advertising categories and across all markets  with the exception of subscription content circulation revenues  which was the only category to show meaningful advancement due to higher subscription rates and expanded cable retransmission revenues 
sizeable cost savings were achieved through a combination of factors including a mandatory employee furlough program  suspension of the company match on the k plan  and lower employee counts  all of which led to reduced compensation costs  a decline in intangibles amortization expense due to the impairment write downs of network affiliation agreement intangibles  and decreased newsprint expense 
additionally  various gains played a role in year over year comparisons such as a million curtailment gain in associated with a final freeze on retirement plans  a 
million net gain in due primarily to a favorable tax ruling in connection with a retained liability from the sale of spnc as compared to a million loss in  million of gains in due to the sprint nextel broadcast equipment conversion  as compared to a million gain in  and a million gain in associated with an insurance recovery  as compared to a million gain for a separate event in these latter items are discussed more fully in note of item of this form k 
excluding the after tax impairment charge in  the company recorded a loss from continuing operations of million in as compared to income from continuing operations of million in the largest factor impacting these results was a million decrease in revenues 
mitigating the significant drop in revenues were cost containment efforts put in place beginning in the florida market in and continuing throughout the rest of the geographic markets in these cost containment efforts resulted in a million decrease in operating costs which excluded the impairment charges  but included severance costs of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the company recorded a million pretax gain on an insurance settlement related to a fire at the company s richmond printing facility that occurred in the second quarter of that year  an additional million pretax gain was recorded in as the company identified a more cost effective method to clean the equipment and remediate the facility than previously anticipated see note of item of this form k 
these gains are included as a reduction to operating costs 
excluding the impact of these gains  the company reduced operating costs by in partially offsetting the downturn in year over year operating results were a decrease in interest expense in due to lower interest rates and decreased average debt levels  a million increase in gains associated with the sprint nextel broadcast equipment conversion  a million reduction 
table of contents in intangibles amortization expense due primarily to the write down of network affiliation assets resulting from the mid year impairment charge  and lower costs for performance based incentives 
additionally  the company recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in which had a million impact on income tax expense see the income taxes section of this md a and note of item in this form k 
segment results as previously mentioned  at the beginning of the third quarter of  the company shifted from three platform based divisions to five geographic market segments and a sixth segment that includes the company s interactive advertising services and certain other operations  collectively  they contain all of the operations that were formerly part of the publishing  broadcast and interactive media segments 
the geographically managed segments are virginia tennessee  florida  mid south  north carolina  and ohio rhode island 
geographic markets revenues as part of this reorganization  revenues have been grouped primarily into five major categories local including the category that was formerly retail in the publishing division  national  political which includes political advertising as was traditionally reported  classified  and subscription content circulation which includes newspaper circulation  broadcast retransmission revenues  and interactive subscription and content revenues 
the following chart summarizes the year over year changes in these select revenue categories year to date change vs vs local national classified political subs content circulation while a depressed advertising market played a significant role in lower local and national advertising revenues  year over year comparisons were also directly affected by the summer olympics  which generated more than million in advertising in that year 
over the past three years  local and national revenues were down due to lower general advertising levels in reaction to the weak economy 
classified advertising declined in virtually all markets due to decreases in employment  automotive and real estate advertising 
the decline in classified results would have been more severe had it not been for the company s relationship with yahoo hotjobs  which allowed for higher rates due to the increase in volume brought about by that relationship 
in  while the local advertising category decreased from the prior year  it was responsible for approximately of the overall drop in advertising revenues as compared to  in  classified advertising was the reason for the largest portion of the revenue decline  particularly in the florida market  where it fell in from the prior year equivalent period 
however  subscription content circulation revenues made meaningful progress in as a rise in cable and satellite retransmission revenues contributed approximately two thirds of the growth  and an increase in newspaper circulation the result of higher rates was responsible for the remainder 
broadcast political advertising time sales are typically higher in even numbered years as a result of the national and statewide political races which generate additional advertising dollars 
these events  or their absence in a given year  cause a certain cyclicality which is demonstrated in the following graph showing political advertising as a percentage of total television time sales 
accordingly  yielded higher political advertising revenues  which were in sharp contrast to and with little deviation from historical trend  political time sales in exceeded five and one half times the prior year level due to strong spending associated with presidential campaigns  us congressional races  and issue spending in certain states 

table of contents logo revenues in the virginia tennessee market fell million and  respectively in and compared to the prior years 
in and  local and classified advertising fell by approximately million and million  respectively  and were the largest contributors to the year over year declines as the recession induced environment continued to take its toll 
partially offsetting weak advertising revenues were strong subscription content circulation revenues in  which showed solid growth due to both rate increases across all newspapers and to strong broadcast retransmission revenues 
improved political advertising and subscription revenue in were largely offset by decreased national advertising 
revenues in the florida market were down approximately in both and from the equivalent prior year periods 
these decreases represented approximately one third of the total consolidated revenue decline in and over half of the total consolidated revenue decline in  reflecting the significantly weakened advertising environment across all sources of advertising dollars 
only political advertising revenues in slightly mitigated this trend with a million improvement year over year due to strong spending associated with the presidential campaigns  us congressional races  and issue spending 
revenues in the mid south market fell million and million in and  respectively  compared to prior years 
up until  the mid south market and north carolina market had been somewhat insulated from the recession that had hit the company s other markets 
in  local advertising was down farthest from the prior year levels with decreased national and political revenues comprising the majority of the remaining shortfall 
with of the company s network affiliated television stations  the mid south market is significantly influenced by political advertising 
political advertising declined more than million in s off election year as compared to  predictably  political revenues improved up million in from with a strong election year and had the effect of partially offsetting the decline in local and national advertising due to weakness in the automotive advertising category 
following the trend  strong subscription content circulation revenues partially offset the other revenue shortfalls in revenues in the north carolina market decreased million and million in and  respectively  from the comparable periods in and while both years suffered declines in local  classified and national ad revenues because of advertiser cutbacks  the magnitude of the declines in these categories was much more amplified in in  the north carolina market s decrease in local  national and classified advertising was further exacerbated by a million decrease in political advertising revenues from the segment s two broadcast stations as compared to a million improvement in political time sales in over additionally  subscription content circulation revenues showed progressive improvement in and on increased cable and satellite retransmission revenues 
revenues in the ohio rhode island market decreased million in from the prior year  but improved million in compared to this is the company s only geographic market which does not include any newspaper operations and is consequently less influenced by classified advertising  but more affected by the ebb and flow of political and olympics revenues in corresponding odd and even numbered years  consequently  this was the only geographic market to show year over year revenue improvement in either of the past two years 
in  political advertising improved million which more than offset the weak economy induced decreases in local and national advertising 
subscription content circulation revenues showed progressive improvement in and due to increases in retransmission fees 

table of contents operating expenses the company has reacted to the challenging advertising environment by reducing costs across all markets while achieving greater efficiencies and implementing aggressive actions to better align expenses with current economic opportunities 
in  cost containment efforts resulted in a reduction in operating expense excluding impairment charges as compared to  in  the company further reduced its cost structure  as evidenced by an approximate decline in operating expenses excluding impairment charges 
instrumental in aligning expenses with the prevailing economic environment were workforce reductions across the entire company which resulted in an approximate decrease in full time equivalent employees from the end of to the end of as discussed previously  the company s results included pretax severance costs of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  as the result of workforce reductions at most operations 
excluding the aforementioned severance costs  total employee compensation expense decreased a substantial and in and from the prior years due to the combination of several factors  including lower employee counts  the elimination of positions at most locations  lower commissions  the consolidation of certain production facilities  the absence of profit sharing expense in  and mandatory unpaid furlough days in newsprint expense fell in from the prior year due to a reduction in consumption because of lower advertising linage  decreased circulation volumes  and concerted conservation efforts including savings from the company s newspapers web width conversions to inch web format  as well as a decrease in average cost per ton 
newsprint costs were down in as compared to as the result of a decline in consumption a result of newspaper redesigns  lower advertising and subscription volumes and conservation efforts  partially offset by a increase in cost per ton 
additional savings were derived in the areas of circulation  advertising sales and promotion across most markets 
operating expenses in the virginia tennessee market decreased million in and million in from the prior years 
consistent with the overall trend  lower employee compensation costs made up the largest portion of the operating expense decrease 
compensation costs decreased million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  reductions in newsprint costs of million and million in and  respectively  were responsible for a substantial part of the remaining decrease 
in an effort to respond to the economic challenges in the florida market  operating expenses shrank by million in and million in  which represented over half of the company s operating expense reductions in compensation expense fell by in and in newsprint costs decreased million and million in and  respectively 
in addition to the areas of expense reduction already discussed  the florida market further reduced departmental costs approximately million to million in and due to concerted cost reductions  elimination  and postponement efforts across all areas of operations  particularly circulation and distribution costs 
operating expenses in the mid south market decreased million in and million in as compared to the prior year 
as previously mentioned  the mid south and north carolina markets were fortunate that  up until  the full impact of the recession was not felt in their markets 
however  as the effects of the soft economy encroached upon them  they reacted swiftly and reduced costs 
in  of the reduced costs in the mid south market were attributable to lower compensation cost  with the majority of the remainder coming from intensive efforts to reduce departmental spending in all areas 
in  cost reductions were on a much smaller scale than  but nonetheless were achieved in the areas of advertising and promotion expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing and compensation costs down million  or million excluding severance costs 
this market has a heavier mix of broadcast stations than newspapers and therefore  while newsprint costs were down  they were proportionally less significant to the overall cost savings than in other markets 
operating expenses decreased million in and million in in the north carolina market and were consistent with the overall market trend of reduced headcount and lower newsprint costs 
in  lower compensation costs accounted for more than half of the market s operating expense reduction  lower newsprint costs combined with reduced departmental spending contributed the remaining savings 
in  savings were achieved through a focus on driving down discretionary spending for repairs and maintenance  promotional and marketing costs combined with lower newsprint costs and compensation costs down 
million  or million excluding severance costs 

table of contents operating expenses in the ohio rhode island market decreased million in and million in compared to the prior year due primarily to lower compensation costs  which were down million in and 
million in or million in excluding severance costs 
additional expense reductions were achieved in departmental spending in the areas of marketing and promotion 
newsprint was not a factor as the company does not operate any newspapers in the ohio rhode island market 
advertising services other advertising services other primarily includes blockdot a leading advergaming business  dealtaker 
com an online social shopping portal that was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of  netinformer a leading provider of mobile advertising and marketing services purchased in the fourth quarter of  production services comprised primarily of a provider of broadcast equipment and studio design services 
revenues in the advertising services other segment in were essentially even with the level  however  components within that market showed significant fluctuations 
dealtaker 
com grew its revenues by more than in part because the company had only nine months of ownership in  reflecting increased traffic and visitors buying from merchant sites 
conversely  production services revenues declined as installation and service sales struggled to meet prior year levels 
revenues in the advertising services other segment decreased million in compared to as the result of two factors 
first  sales in production services fell as the digital conversion to broadcast high definition was substantially completed at the end of second  revenues at blockdot were down million as the pace of advergaming sales was adversely affected by the sluggish economy 
these reductions were offset  in part  by the acquisition at the beginning of the second quarter of of dealtaker 
com  which generated revenues of million in operating costs were down in and in due primarily to lower compensation costs 
additionally  lower cost of goods sold was in line with the previously mentioned reduced volume of work at production services 
operating profit loss the following chart shows the change in operating profit by market  the year over year movement in market operating profit was driven by the underlying fluctuations in revenue and expense as detailed in the previous discussion 

table of contents change in operating profit loss versus versus in millions amount percent amount percent virginia tennessee florida mid south north carolina ohio rhode island advertising services other eliminations disc 
ops in  the north carolina  mid south  and ohio rhode island markets contributed the largest portion of the year over year operating profit shortfall 
while all of these markets were impacted by reduced advertising revenues  particularly local  the ohio rhode island and mid south markets were especially hard hit by the absence of olympics generated revenues and the virtual absence of political advertising 
anemic classified revenues in the north carolina market contributed as well 
the virginia tennessee market showed only a small decline as lower revenues were tempered by reduced operating costs 
lower compensation and newsprint costs more than offset reduced revenues in the florida market to produce a million increase in year over year operating profits 
in  the virginia tennessee and florida markets were responsible for the majority of the operating profit shortfall from the prior year 
lower operating expenses in these markets were unable to overcome decreased revenues 
both markets were impacted by significantly reduced advertising in their publishing operations as compared to the other geographic markets with significant broadcast stations which benefitted from strong political advertising revenue 
advertising services other operating profit benefitted from the second quarter acquisition of dealtaker 
com which produced robust operating profits of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in from the prior year due to a million decline in average debt levels  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average interest rate to 
in the third quarter of  the company entered into three interest rate swaps where it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate to manage interest cost and cash flows associated with variable interest rates  primarily short term changes in libor  not to trade such instruments for profit or loss 
the interest rate swaps are carried at fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis predicated on quoted libor prices of the estimated amounts the company would have received or paid to terminate the swaps 
these interest rate swaps were cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling million  swaps with notional amounts of million matured in  and million will mature in changes in cash flows of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the interest payments on the company s bank term loan 
these swaps effectively convert the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate approximating at december  income taxes the company s effective tax rate on income loss from continuing operations was on a pretax loss  on pretax loss and on pretax income  including a specific tax benefit in  and  respectively 
the increase in the rate reflects a normalized tax rate attributed to a nol carryback benefit of approximately million as well as the intraperiod tax allocation rules 
the relatively low rate in was due principally to the non deductible goodwill which could not be tax benefitted that was included as a component of the impairment charge in that year 
the atypically low rate in was due to the relatively greater impact that favorable permanent differences book versus tax had on that year s reduced pretax income and to a tax benefit of thousand that the company recognized in to record the favorable resolution of an outstanding state income tax assessment 
as of december  and december  the company had a valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively  because cumulative pretax income in recent years 
table of contents was in an overall loss position primarily due to non cash impairment charges 
there was no valuation allowance as of december  the decrease in the net deferred tax balance and corresponding valuation allowance was due principally to the availability of an nol carryback benefit permitted by recent legislation as well as a sharp reduction in the unfunded pension liability 
see note in item of this form k for a complete discussion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company adopted an accounting standard related to the uncertainty in income taxes at the beginning of fiscal and recognized a million net increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions  which was accounted for as a reduction of retained earnings 
see note of item in this form k for a complete discussion of the adoption of this standard and the roll forward of the liability of uncertain tax positions 
other the company has certain plans in place  mainly the supplemental k plan and the director s deferred compensation plan  which are designed to align the interests of the participants with those of the shareholders 
future fluctuations in the company s stock price could have a significant effect on the amount of expense recognized 
each change in the company s stock price as of december  would have affected the company s pretax income by approximately 
million 
liquidity over the past several years the overall economy has been faced with a recession and a credit crisis  both of which have had a direct impact on the company 
the impact of the economy on the company s operating results has been detailed above  and the credit crisis has made the process of amending and revising the company s financing structure increasingly difficult 
despite those difficulties  the company has successfully amended its financing structure three times and successfully met all covenants in those agreements 
subsequent to the end of  the company put a new financing structure in place that is expected to serve its needs for the next several years 
the company simultaneously amended and extended its bank debt and issued senior notes in a private placement 
the proceeds from the senior notes  which mature in  were used to pay down existing bank credit facilities 
at the same time the maturity of the bank facility was extended to march  and the revised operating covenants under the agreements provide additional financial flexibility for the company 
the steps that the company has taken to lower its debt levels in recent years and to implement the new financing structure should allow the company the flexibility necessary to operate within the debt covenants at a cost the company believes to be manageable 
following the closing of these transactions on february   the company has in place with its syndicate of banks a million term loan that is fully drawn and a million revolving credit line with million drawn 
also outstanding are senior notes with a par value of million that were sold at a discount 
the amended bank credit facilities mature in march and bear an interest rate of libor plus a margin immediately following closing based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
total debt outstanding was million as of the closing of the transactions 
the new agreements have two main financial covenants a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio which involve debt levels  interest expense as well as other fixed charges  and a rolling four quarter calculation of ebitda all as defined in the agreements 
these ratios have been amended to reflect the current operating environment and they position the company to emerge from the current economic downturn 
the company has pledged its cash and assets as well as the stock of its subsidiaries as collateral  the company s subsidiaries also guaranteed the debt securities of the parent company 
additionally  there are restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends none are allowed in or  make capital expenditures above certain levels  repurchase its stock  and engage in certain other transactions such as making investments or entering into capital leases above certain preset levels 
from to  the company operated under credit facilities with a syndicate of banks that was originally established in at its peak  availability under these facilities exceeded billion 
at year end  the company s debt consisted of a modified revolving credit facility of million million outstanding and a term loan of million 
following amendments in late and  these facilities matured in and contained leverage and interest coverage ratios 
thus a decline in operating performance adversely affected these ratios 
as the wider economy and the company s performance deteriorated during the to period  the company reduced its operating expenses though a series of increasing cost reduction and elimination efforts  sold its interest in spnc and certain television stations  and reduced capital expenditures 
in late  the company cut its quarterly dividend 
table of contents in half  in it indefinitely suspended the dividend 
additional actions in included suspending the match of the k plan effective april st  freezing benefits under its retirement plans  and implementing an employee furlough program whereby most employees had days of unpaid leave 
there have been no management bonuses or profit sharing payments for employees in recent years 
since the beginning of  the company has repaid more than million of debt 
it has made acquisitions totaling million  primarily targeting online and advertising services companies 
it has taken necessary actions as noted in the preceding paragraph to remain compliant with all debt covenants 
the company believes that its operating cash flow over the next year together with availability under its new financing structure provides the necessary financial flexibility to manage its working capital and capital expenditure needs while developing new products and revenue streams and maintaining existing ones 
the company currently anticipates its operating results will include higher revenues as the economy continues to improve  particularly at its television stations due to the typical even year presence of olympics and political advertising  digital revenues are also expected to grow 
however  interest expense is expected to be approximately million higher in than in  including certain costs expensed at the closing of the new financing structure  representing a all in rate for the year 
additionally  there are no current plans to re institute the furlough program  which saved the company more than million in  and certain other spending that had been postponed or curtailed may be permitted depending on the revenue environment 
the company will continue to monitor its revenues  expense levels  and debt covenants and will adjust its operations and capital expenditures as appropriate to maintain cash flow and ensure compliance with the covenants going forward 
the company s current plans anticipate a modest reduction of debt in the company does not have material off balance sheet arrangements 
the table that follows shows long term debt and other specified obligations of the company as of december  in millions payments due by periods contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt revolving credit facility term loan operating leases broadcast film rights estimated benefit payments from company assets purchase obligations total specified obligations other than the estimated benefit payments from company assets and broadcast film rights disclosed above and discussed further below  the table excludes items contained in other liabilities and deferred credits on the consolidated balance sheets  primarily because the ultimate timing and amount of these future payments is not determinable 
as disclosed in note of item of this form k  the company had a non current liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million at december  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or period in which the ultimate settlement of these uncertain tax positions will occur  therefore the contractual obligations table excludes this liability 
the table reflects the company s long term debt as of the end of the year and not the new financing structure that the company entered into february  since the company had the legal right to prepay its long term debt at that time without penalty  no future interest expense was included 
minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
broadcast film rights include both recorded short term and long term liabilities for programs which have been produced and unrecorded commitments to purchase film rights which are not yet available for broadcast 
actuarially estimated benefit payments under pension and other benefit plans expected to be funded directly from company assets through which excludes expected contributions to the qualified pension plan 
the company currently expects to contribute million and million to its qualified pension plan in and  respectively  which is in excess of the expected minimum funding requirements 
a further discussion is included in the paragraph that follows this chart 
purchase obligations include all current liabilities not otherwise reported in the table that will require cash settlement  significant purchase commitments for fixed assets  and significant non ordinary course contract based obligations 
purchase obligations exclude the company s purchase commitment to spnc for newsprint as the contract is based on market prices which are highly volatile 
as indicated in note of item of this form k  the company is committed to purchase a minimum of approximately thousand tons of newsprint in and thousand tons of newsprint per year through from spnc 

table of contents the company s unfunded obligation under its pension plans improved significantly in see note of item of this form k due to a improvement in the value of plan assets and a reduction in the plans liabilities 
the company made contributions in excess of required minimum contributions of million to its retirement plan in and currently anticipates making million in contributions in and million in by making contributions before they are required as it has in the past the company expects to limit the ultimate amount that it will need to contribute 
many factors influence the required funding for the plan including the return on invested assets  funding requirements that are set forth by erisa in enacting the laws passed by congress  and the long term discount rates that are applied to the funds benefit liabilities 
the amounts shown in the preceding table do not reflect plan contributions 
if the factors noted above remain unchanged  the company s required contributions in subsequent years would be of a similar magnitude 
outlook for the company believes that holds the prospect of a gradual improvement in the economy  advertising spending patterns that show signs of firming  and additional revenues which an even numbered year draws from political and olympics advertising dollars 
higher revenues are expected to lead to increased market operating profits  however  increased interest expense and increased income tax expense  both of which were described earlier  will most likely offset much of the operating improvement 
however  the new financing structure will provide the company with greater financial flexibility to pursue its business strategy of further developing its fast growing digital media business while maintaining strong local broadcast television and newspaper platforms 
the company s flatter and leaner organizational structure strengthens and speeds its ability to react to rapid changes within its business without bias to media platform 
this market based structure enhances the company s ability to closely connect with existing customers and creates new opportunities to reach non customers  all of which strengthen its ability to weather the short term while positioning itself for long term success

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally associated with interest rates and newsprint costs 
the company is subject to interest rate fluctuations related to debt obligations 
these fluctuations are managed by balancing the amount of fixed versus variable rate borrowings including the use of interest rate swaps as described more fully in note of item of this form k 
based on the variable rate debt outstanding during   and  a basis point change in interest rates would have altered pretax interest expense by million to million 
newsprint is a commodity whose price is subject to supply and demand imbalances 
with the sale of its interest in spnc in  the company is now solely a newsprint consumer 
newsprint expense represented in  and in and of the company s production costs 
focused solely on the number of tons consumed  a change in newsprint prices would have altered the company s newsprint expense in   and by approximately thousand to million
