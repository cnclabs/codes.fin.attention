item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trust overview the trust is an investment trust that was formed on november  date of inception 
the trust issues baskets of shares  or baskets  in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with the redemption of baskets 
the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion  less the expenses of the trust s operations 
the shares are designed to provide investors with a cost effective and convenient way to invest in gold 
investing in the shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks  including price volatility 
the following table illustrates the movement in the price of the shares and net asset value of the shares against the corresponding gold price per of an oz

valuation of gold  definition of net asset value and adjusted net asset value as of the london pm fix on each day that nyse arca is open for regular trading or  if there is no london pm fix on such day or the london pm fix has not been announced by pm new york time on such day  as of pm new york time on such day  or the valuation time  the trustee values the gold held by the trust and determines both the anav and the nav of the trust 
at the valuation time  the trustee values the trust s gold on the basis of that day s london pm fix or  if no london pm fix is made on such day or has not been announced by the valuation time  the next most recent london gold price fix am or pm determined prior to the valuation time will be used  unless the trustee  in consultation with the sponsor  determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation 
in the event the trustee and the sponsor determine that the london pm fix or last prior london fix is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the trust s gold  they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the trustee 

table of contents once the value of the gold has been determined  the trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees other than the fees to be computed by reference to the value of the anav of the trust or custody fees computed by reference to the value of gold held in the trust  expenses and other liabilities of the trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the trust other than any amounts credited to the trust s reserve account  if established 
the resulting figure is the anav of the trust 
the anav of the trust is used to compute the fees of the trustee  the sponsor and the marketing agent 
to determine the trust s nav  the trustee subtracts from the anav of the trust the amount of estimated accrued fees computed by reference to the value of the anav of the trust and computed by reference to the value of the gold held in the trust ie the fees of the trustee  the sponsor  the marketing agent and the custodian 
the trustee determines the nav per share by dividing the nav of the trust by the number of shares outstanding as of the close of trading on nyse arca

cash flow from operations the trust had no net cash flow from operations in the years ended september   and cash received in respect of gold sold to pay expenses in the years ended september   and was the same as those expenses  resulting in a zero cash balance at september   and off balance sheet arrangements the trust is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
cash resources and liquidity at september  and the trust did not have any cash balances 
when selling gold to pay expenses  the trustee endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the trust s holdings of assets other than gold 
as a consequence  we expect that the trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period
