we currently own or manage nineteen facilities in fifteen jurisdictions  including colorado  florida  illinois  indiana  iowa  louisiana  maine  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  new mexico  ohio  pennsylvania  west virginia  and ontario 
we believe that our portfolio of assets provides us with a diversified cash flow from operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  and expect to continue to pursue additional acquisition and development opportunities in the future 
in  we began our transition from a pari mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the charles town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in west virginia 
since  we have continued to expand our gaming operations through strategic acquisitions including the acquisitions of hollywood casino bay st 
louis and boomtown biloxi  crc holdings  inc  the bullwhackers properties  hollywood casino corporation  argosy gaming company  black gold casino at zia park  and sanford orlando kennel club  greenfield projects such as at hollywood casino at penn national race course and hollywood slots hotel and raceway and property expansions such as at charles town entertainment complex and hollywood casino lawrenceburg

other revenues are derived from our management service fee from casino rama  our hotel  dining  retail  admissions  program sales  concessions and certain other ancillary activities  and our racing operations 
our racing revenue includes our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting  and our share of wagering from our off track wagering facilities otws

current capital projects are ongoing at several of our existing properties  including empress casino hotel  charles town entertainment complex  hollywood casino at penn national race course  and hollywood casino perryville  as well as at our proposed facilities in kansas and ohio 
key performance indicators related to gaming revenue are slot handle volume indicator  table game drop volume indicator and win or hold percentages 
our typical property slot win percentage is in the range of to of slot handle  and our typical table game win percentage is in the range of to of table game drop 
our properties generate significant operating cash flow  since most of our revenue is cash based from slot machines and pari mutuel wagering

current capital projects are ongoing at several of our existing properties  including empress casino hotel  charles town entertainment complex  hollywood casino at penn national race course  and hollywood casino perryville  as well as at our proposed facilities in kansas and ohio 
additional information regarding our capital projects is discussed in detail in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures below 
critical accounting policies we make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the nature of the estimates and assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain factors or the susceptibility of such factors to change 
we have identified the policies related to the accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes and litigation  claims and assessments as critical accounting policies  which require us to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and  in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosures  have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million within our consolidated balance sheet  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by us in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for 
table of contents these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets within our consolidated balance sheet  representing and of total assets  respectively  resulting from our acquisition of other businesses and payment for gaming licenses and racing permits 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  valuations are completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuations include data gathered as a result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions  projections for future operations  and data obtained from third party valuation specialists as deemed appropriate 
goodwill is tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment test is performed to determine the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit 
if the implied value is less than the carrying amount for that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized for that reporting unit 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we consider our gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets as indefinite life intangible assets that do not require amortization 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amounts of the gaming license  racing permit and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
we use a market approach model  which includes the use of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  charges for stock compensation  depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on disposal of assets  and certain other income and expenses  and inclusive of loss from joint venture multiples  as we believe that ebitda is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry and as we use ebitda as the primary measurement of the operating performance of our properties including the evaluation of operating personnel 
in addition  we believe that an ebitda multiple is the principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies 
changes in the estimated ebitda multiple or forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite life intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts 
intangible assets that have a definite life  including the management service contract for casino rama  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or related service contract 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets that have a definite life for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the intangible assets that have a definite life exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
income taxes at december   we had a net deferred tax liability balance of million within our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a 
table of contents valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
asc also creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions  and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  which is included in noncurrent tax liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations the following are the most important factors and trends that contribute to our operating performance the fact that most of our properties operate in mature competitive markets 
as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  jurisdictional expansions such as the property openings in pennsylvania and maine  as well as the anticipated openings in maryland  kansas and ohio and expansions improvements of existing properties 
the actions of government bodies can affect our operations in a variety of ways 
for instance  the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in addition  government bodies may restrict  prevent or negatively impact operations in the jurisdictions in which we do business such as the illinois  colorado and pennsylvania smoking bans that became effective on january  
the fact that a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in kansas  ohio and maryland and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as the potential introduction of commercial casinos in kansas  maryland  ohio  and kentucky  an additional gaming license in illinois  and the introduction of tavern licenses in several states 
we also face uncertainty regarding anticipated gaming expansion by one of our competitors in baton rouge  louisiana 
legalized gaming from native american casinos can also have a significant competitive effect 
the continued demand for  and our emphasis on  slot wagering entertainment at our properties
