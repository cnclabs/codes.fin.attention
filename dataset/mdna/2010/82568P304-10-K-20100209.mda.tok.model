we currently generate the majority of our revenues by producing and selling professionally bound photo books  personalized calendars  greeting cards and stationery  other photo based merchandise and high quality prints ranging in size from wallet sized to jumbo sized x enlargements 
we currently manufacture these items in our charlotte  north carolina and phoenix  arizona manufacturing facilities 
our new manufacturing and production facility in phoenix  arizona began operations in april  and replaced our hayward  california facility  which ceased operations in january by controlling the production process in our own manufacturing facilities  we are able to produce high quality products  innovate rapidly  maintain a favorable cost structure and ensure timely shipment to customers  even during peak periods of demand 
additionally  we sell a variety of photo based merchandise that is currently manufactured for us by third parties  such as calendars  mugs  canvas prints  mouse pads  magnets and puzzles 
we generate substantially all of our revenue from sales originating in the united states and our sales cycle has historically been highly seasonal as we generate more than of our revenue during our fiscal fourth quarter 
during fiscal year  we fulfilled million orders  to million customers  at an average order value of per order 
our high quality products and services and the compelling online experience we create for our customers  combined with our focus on continuous innovation  have allowed us to establish a premium brand 
we realize the benefits of a premium brand through high customer loyalty  low customer acquisition costs and premium pricing 
our customers are a central part of our business model 
they generate most of the content on our service by uploading their photos and storing their memories 
in addition  they share their photos electronically with their friends and families  extending and endorsing our brand and creating a sense of community 
finally  by giving shutterfly branded products to colleagues  friends and loved ones throughout the year  customers reinforce the shutterfly brand 
through these various activities  our customers create a viral network of new users and customers 
in addition to driving lower customer acquisition costs through viral marketing  our customers provide input on new features  functionalities and products 
close  frequent customer interactions  coupled with significant investments in sophisticated integrated marketing programs  enable us to fine tune and tailor our promotions and website presentation to specific customer segments 
consequently  customers are presented with a highly personalized shutterfly shopping experience  which helps foster a unique and deep relationship with our brand 
basis of presentation net revenues 
our net revenues are comprised of sales generated from personalized products and services pps  prints and commercial printing services 
personalized products and services our personalized products and services revenues are derived from the sale of photo based products  such as photo books  greeting and stationery cards  calendars and other photo based merchandise and ancillary products and services  and the related shipping revenues 
revenue from advertising displayed on our website and referral fees are also included in pps revenue 
our referral fees have been approximately  and of our net annual revenues for   and our referral fee program will be discontinued effective march  as a result  referral fee revenues during are expected to total less than of total net revenues and no referral fee revenues are expected subsequent to march  prints we also generate revenue from photo prints and the associated shipping revenue 
photo prints consist of wallet  x  x  x  photocards and large format sizes 
commercial print services in order to use available print capacity during low volume periods and to leverage our large installed base of existing digital printers  we began providing commercial printing services in in and  we entered into various strategic relations with marketing companies to provide high quality printing services 
we continue to focus our efforts in expanding our presence in this market 
all of our consumer revenue is recorded net of estimated returns  promotions redeemed by customers and other discounts 
customers place orders through our website and pay primarily using credit cards 
advertising and commercial print customers are invoiced upon fulfillment 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in particular  we generate a substantial portion of our revenues during the holiday season in the calendar fourth quarter 
we also typically experience increases in net revenues during other shopping related seasonal events  such as easter  mother s day  father s day  and halloween 
we generally experience lower net revenues and revenue growth during the first  second and third calendar quarters and have incurred and may continue to incur losses in these quarters 
due to the relatively short lead time required to fulfill product orders  usually one to three business days  order backlog is not material to our business 
to further understand net revenue trends  we monitor several key metrics including total customers 
we closely monitor total customers as a key indicator of demand 
total customers include the number of transacting customers in a given period 
we seek to expand our customer base by empowering our existing customers with sharing and collaboration services such as shutterfly gallery and shutterfly share sites  and by conducting integrated marketing and advertising programs 
total customers have increased on an annual basis for each year since inception and while we expect this trend to continue  the number of customers is dependent on whether we are successful in executing our strategy in addition to the conditions of the overall economic environment 
average order value 
average order value is net revenues  excluding revenues from our commercial print initiative  for a given period divided by the total number of customer orders recorded during that same period 
we seek to increase average order value as a means of increasing net revenues 
average order value has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and we anticipate that this trend will continue in the future as consumers shift from prints into personalized products and services 
as a result of discontinuing our referral fee program  effective march   we expect our average order value growth will moderate as a result of the decline in this revenue source 
total number of orders 
we closely monitor total number of orders as a leading indicator of net revenue trends 
we recognize the net revenues associated with an order when the products have been shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
orders are typically processed and shipped within two business days after a customer places an order 
total number of orders has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and while we anticipate this trend to continue in the future  the number of orders is dependent on whether we are successful in executing our strategy  the conditions of the overall economic environment and a continued increase in consumer trends towards photo based products 
personalized products and services revenues as percentage of net revenues 
we continue to innovate and improve our personalized products and services and expect the net revenues from these products and services to increase as a percentage of total net revenues as we continue to diversify our product offerings 
personalized products and services as a percentage of total net revenue was in  in and in we believe the analysis of these metrics and others provides us with important information on our overall net revenue trends and operating results 
fluctuations in these metrics are not unusual and no single factor is determinative of our net revenues and operating results 
cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues consists primarily of direct materials the majority of which consists of paper  ink  and photo book covers  payroll and related expenses for direct labor  shipping charges  packaging supplies  distribution and fulfillment activities  rent for production facilities  depreciation of production equipment  and third party costs for photo based merchandise 
cost of net revenues also includes payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in customer service  any third party software or patents licensed  as well as the amortization of acquired developed technology  capitalized website development costs  and patent royalties 
in addition  cost of net revenues includes certain costs associated with the closure of our hayward manufacturing and production facility 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of technology and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenues 
technology and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees and contractors engaged in the development and ongoing maintenance of our website  infrastructure and software 
these expenses include depreciation of the computer and network hardware used to run our website and store the customer data  as well as amortization of purchased software 
technology and development expense also includes co location  power and bandwidth costs 
sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for marketing programs and personnel and related expenses for our customer acquisition  product marketing  business development and public relations activities 
our marketing efforts consist of various online and offline media programs  such as e mail and direct mail promotions  the purchase of keyword search terms and various strategic alliances 
we depend on these efforts to attract customers to our service 
general and administrative expense includes general corporate costs  including rent for our corporate offices  insurance  depreciation on information technology equipment and legal and accounting fees 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes personnel expenses of employees involved in executive  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology and legal roles 
third party payment processor and credit card fees are also included in general and administrative expense and have historically fluctuated based on revenues during the period 
all of the payments we have received from our intellectual property license agreements have been included as an offset to general and administrative expense 
in  we received annual payments from two different cross licensing agreements 
we expect to recognize a final payment due from one of the agreements when it is received in the first quarter of fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest costs recognized under our capital lease obligations as well as costs associated with our line of credit facility 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists of the interest earned on our cash and investment accounts as well as gains losses on our trading securities and the right from ubs entitling us to sell at par value auction rate securities previously purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  income taxes 
historically  we have only been subject to taxation in the united states because we only operate within the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are the most critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from the printing and shipping of prints and other photo based products  advertising services and commercial print services 
we generally recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists typically through the use of a credit card or receipt of a check  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenues from amounts billed to customers  including prepaid orders  are deferred until shipment of fulfilled orders 
we provide our customers with a satisfaction guarantee whereby products can be returned within a day period for a reprint or refund 
we maintain an allowance for estimated future returns based on historical data 
during the year ended december   returns totaled less than of net revenues and have been within management s expectations 
we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers in exchange for setting up an account and to encourage purchases 
such offers include free products and percentage discounts on current purchases 
discounts  when accepted by customers  are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are included in net revenues 
production costs related to free products are included in costs of revenues upon redemption 
shipping charged to customers is recognized as revenue at the time of shipment 
our advertising revenues are derived from the sale of online advertisements on our website 
advertising revenues are recognized as impressions ie  the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our website are delivered  as clicks which are generated each time users on our website click through our advertisements to an advertiser s designated website are provided to advertisers  or ratably over the term of the agreement with the expectation that the advertisement will be delivered ratably over the contract period 
we recognize commercial print revenue upon shipment  consistent with our product revenue policy 
inventories 
our inventories consist primarily of paper  photo book covers and packaging supplies and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
the value of inventories is reduced by an estimate for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate for excess and obsolete inventories is based upon management s review of utilization of inventories in light of projected sales  current market conditions and market trends 
fair value 
we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the accounting standard for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value  clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date 
the accounting standard establishes a three tier hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we utilized a discounted cash flow approach to determine the level valuation for our auction rate securities 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
they represent our estimates given available data as of december  we also measure the rights at fair value  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the auction rate securities 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we account for intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from one to sixteen years 
for annual goodwill impairment analysis  we operate under one reporting unit 
we determined the fair value of our reporting unit based on its enterprise value 
this reporting unit was not at risk of failing step one of the annual goodwill impairment test for years ended december  and software and website development costs 
we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with asc formerly aicpa statement of position no 
accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf issue no 
accounting for website development costs 
accordingly  payroll and payroll related costs and stock based compensation incurred in the development phase are capitalized and amortized over the product s estimated useful life  which is generally three years 
costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for our website are expensed as incurred 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying the statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we believe that all net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which will impact deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc formerly financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
we are required to make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for our stock based awards in accordance with asc formerly sfas r share based payment  which requires a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of restricted stock awards and performance based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense is recognized for restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
compensation expense associated with performance based restricted stock awards is recognized on an accelerated attribution model  and ultimately based on whether or not satisfaction of the performance criteria is probable 
if in the future  situations indicate that the performance criteria are not probable  then no further compensation cost will be recorded  and any previous costs will be reversed

in addition  to supplement our overall liquidity position  we have a day revolving credit facility with a financial institution to provide up to million in additional capital resources that expires in june as of december   no amounts have been drawn against this facility 
at december   we held approximately million par value of variable rate bond investments with a fair value of approximately million  classified as short term investments  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
since february  these auctions have failed 
therefore the ars continue to be illiquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment providers  entitling us to sell at par value ars purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  the right 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the right 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
we intend to exercise the rights on june  due to the adverse conditions in the auction rate securities market  we have used a level discounted cash flow valuation model to value the ars investments and the right 
we believe there are several significant assumptions that are utilized in our ars valuation analysis  the two most critical of which are the discount rate and the average expected term 
holding all other factors constant  if we were to increase the discount rate utilized in our valuation analysis by basis points  or one half of a percentage point  this change would have the effect of reducing the fair value of our ars by approximately million as of december  similarly  holding all other factors constant  if we were to increase the average expected term utilized in our fair value calculation by one year  this change would have the effect of reducing the fair value of our ars by approximately million as of december  we also consider credit ratings with respect to our investments provided by investment ratings agencies 
as of december   all of our investments conformed to the requirements of our investment policy  which requires that all of our investments meet high credit quality standards as defined by credit ratings of the major investment ratings agencies 
these ratings are subject to change and a downgrade in rating would adversely affect the value of our investments 
although these investments continue to be illiquid  during we liquidated million at par value ars investments that were called by the state issuers 
non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
we closely monitor two financial measures  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
free cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software and website development costs 
management believes these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that  when viewed with our gaap results  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows 
refer below for a reconciliation of both adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to the most applicable gaap measure 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we believe that these non gaap measures provide useful information about our core operating results and thus are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future 
these adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends and performance 
management uses these non gaap measures to evaluate our financial results  develop budgets  manage expenditures  and determine employee compensation 
the presentation of additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to net income loss or net income loss per share determined in accordance with gaap 
management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
the table below shows the trend of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue over fiscal years   and in thousands year ended december  revenue non gaap adjusted ebitda ebitda of revenue free cash flow free cash flow of revenue by carefully managing our operating costs and capital expenditures  we were able to make the strategic investments necessary to grow and strengthen our business  while at the same time increasing our adjusted ebitda profitability and substantially improving our free cash flows 
our full year adjusted ebitda profitability rate improved from in to in our capital expenditures have decreased from to as we continue to make strategic capital investments that are necessary to support our overall growth as a business  improve efficiencies in our production and satisfy our customer needs while improving our cost imperatives 
as a result  our free cash flow during was million compared to million in free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 
for example  free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash requirements to comply with debt covenants 
therefore  we believe that it is important to view free cash flow as a compliment to our consolidated financial statements as reported 
the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure  net income for the years ended december   and in thousands reconciliation of non gaap adjusted ebitda year ended december  net income add back interest expense interest and other income  net   tax provision    depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense non gaap adjusted ebitda reconciliation of non gaap adjusted ebitda to free cash flow year ended december  non gaap adjusted ebitda less purchases of property and equipment  including accrual amounts less capitalized technology development costs free cash flow below is our cash flow activity for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands consolidated statement of cash flows data purchases of property and equipment capitalization of software and website development costs acquisition of business and intangibles  net of cash acquired depreciation and amortization cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows from financing activities we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balances  cash generated from operations and our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital lease obligations  expansion plans and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  operating results and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional debt or equity 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
financing arrangements may not be available to us  or may not be in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will range between to of our expected net revenues in these expenditures will be used to purchase technology and equipment to support the growth in our business and to increase our production capacity and help enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer demand 
our expenditures also include costs associated with capitalized software and website development 
this range of capital expenditures is not outside the ordinary course of our business or materially different from how we have expanded our business in the past

contractual obligations we lease office space in redwood city  california and a production facility in charlotte  north carolina under non cancelable operating leases that expire in and  respectively 
in  we terminated the lease at our hayward  california facility effective june  which was originally scheduled to expire in september in  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease for our new phoenix  arizona facility that commenced in february and will expire in we lease information technology equipment under various capital leases that expire through we also have co location agreements with third party hosting facilities that expire in as a result of our growth strategies  we believe that our liquidity and capital resources requirements will grow in absolute dollars but will be generally consistent with historical periods on an annual basis as a percentage of net revenues 
we anticipate leasing additional office space  production facilities and hosting facilities in future periods as the need arises  consistent with our historical business model 
the following are contractual obligations at december   associated with lease obligations and other arrangements total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the table above excludes the impact of approximately million related to unrecognized tax benefits as of december  the company cannot make reliable estimates of the future cash flows by period related to this obligation 
other than the obligations  liabilities and commitments described above  we have no significant unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments 
we are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued an accounting standard update that delayed the effective date of fair value measurements accounting for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal these include goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets 
we adopted this accounting standard update effective january  the adoption of this update to non financial assets and liabilities  as codified in asc formerly fasb staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
 did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard update regarding business combinations 
as codified under asc formerly sfas no 
revised  business combinations  this update requires an entity to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes 
in addition  acquired in process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life 
with the adoption of this accounting standard update  any tax related adjustments associated with acquisitions that closed prior to january  will be recorded through income tax expense  whereas the previous accounting treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price 
this accounting standard update applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted an accounting standard which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary  as codified in asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting and reporting on non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb 
this accounting standard states that accounting and reporting for minority interests are to be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
the calculation of earnings per share continues to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent 
the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted an accounting standard update regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
as codified in asc formerly fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  this update amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under intangibles accounting 
it also requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under prior business combination accounting and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under the new business combinations accounting as currently codified under asc 
the update also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard update from the emerging issues task force eitf consensus regarding the accounting of defensive intangible assets 
this update  as codified in asc formerly eitf no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets  clarifies accounting for defensive intangible assets subsequent to initial measurement 
it applies to acquired intangible assets which an entity has no intention of actively using  or intends to discontinue use of  the intangible asset but holds it to prevent others from obtaining access to it ie  a defensive intangible asset 
under this update  a consensus was reached that an acquired defensive asset should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting ie  an asset separate from other assets of the acquirer  and the useful life assigned to an acquired defensive asset should be based on the period during which the asset would diminish in value 
the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted a new accounting standard for subsequent events  as codified in asc formerly sfas no 
 subsequent events 
the update modifies the names of the two types of subsequent events either as recognized subsequent events previously referred to in practice as type i subsequent events or non recognized subsequent events previously referred to in practice as type ii subsequent events 
in addition  the standard modifies the definition of subsequent events to refer to events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued for public entities or available to be issued for nonpublic entities 
it also requires the disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the update did not result in significant changes in the practice of subsequent event disclosures  and therefore the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective april   we adopted three accounting standard updates which were intended to provide additional application guidance and enhanced disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities 
they also provide additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value accounting 
the first update  as codified in asc formerly fsp no 
 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  provides additional guidelines for estimating fair value in accordance with fair value accounting 
the second accounting update  as codified in asc formerly fsp no 
 recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  changes accounting requirements for other than temporary impairment otti for debt securities by replacing the current requirement that a holder have the positive intent and ability to hold an impaired security to recovery in order to conclude an impairment was temporary with a requirement that an entity conclude it does not intend to sell an impaired security and it will not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
the third accounting update  as codified in asc formerly accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  increases the frequency of fair value disclosures 
these updates were effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  the adoption of these accounting updates did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective july   we adopted the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles asc  formerly sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this standard establishes only two levels of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  authoritative and nonauthoritative 
the financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards codification the codification became the source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap  except for rules and interpretive releases of the sec  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
we began using the new guidelines and numbering system prescribed by the codification when referring to gaap in the third quarter of fiscal as the codification was not intended to change or alter existing gaap  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk 
we have exposure to interest rate risk that relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
all of our cash equivalents are carried at market value 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
at december   we held approximately million par value of variable rate bond investments with a fair value of approximately million  classified as short term investments  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
since february  these auctions have failed 
therefore the ars continue to be illiquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment providers  entitling us to sell at par value ars purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  the right 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the right 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the right 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
we intend to exercise the rights on june  although these investments continue to be illiquid  during we liquidated million at par value ars investments that were called by the state issuers 
inflation 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our current business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  for example  if the cost of our materials or the cost of shipping our products to customers were to incur substantial increases as a result of the rapid rise in the cost of oil  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
