critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including evaluation of the collectability of accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets  purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate  derivative instruments and share based compensation 
the following is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition rental revenue under leases with scheduled rent increases or rent abatements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases 
accrued straight line rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over contractual rent under applicable lease provisions 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of the company s property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized on the date of termination when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
the company must make estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income as a higher required allowance for doubtful accounts receivable will result in lower net income 
the uncollectible portion of the amounts due from tenants  including straight line rents  is charged to property operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate are initially recorded at fair value 
improvements and replacements are capitalized at historical cost when they extend the useful life  increase capacity  or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives of the company s assets  by class  are as follows buildings years building improvements to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases lease related intangible assets term of related lease the company regularly reviews market conditions for possible impairment of a property s carrying value 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions  changes in management s intended holding period or potential sale to a third party indicate a possible impairment of the fair value of a property  an impairment analysis is performed 
the company assesses the recoverability based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
this estimate is based on projections of future revenues  expenses  capital improvement costs  expected holding periods and cap rates 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  market trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment based on forecast undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make estimates as to whether there are impairments in the carrying values of its investments in real estate 
further  the company will record an impairment loss if it expects to dispose of a property  in the near term  at a price below carrying value 
in such an event  the company will record an impairment loss based on the difference between a property s carrying value and its projected sales price  less any estimated costs to sell 
the company will classify a building as held for sale in the period in which it has made the decision to dispose of the building  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist that could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
if these criteria are met  the company will record an impairment loss if the fair value  less anticipated selling costs  is lower than the carrying amount of the property 
the company will classify any impairment loss  together with the building s operating results  as discontinued operations in its statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on its consolidated balance sheets 
interest expense is reclassified to discontinued operations only to the extent the held for sale property is secured by specific mortgage debt and the mortgage debt will not be transferred to another property owned by the company after the disposition 
the company recognizes the fair value  if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value  of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations when incurred  which is generally upon acquisition  construction  development or redevelopment and or through the normal operation of the asset 
the company capitalizes interest costs incurred on qualifying expenditures for real estate assets under development or redevelopment while being readied for their intended use in accordance with accounting requirements regarding capitalization of interest 
the company will capitalize interest when qualifying expenditures for the asset have been made  activities necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use are in progress and interest costs are being incurred 
capitalized interest also includes interest associated with expenditures incurred to acquire developable land while development activities are in progress 
capitalization of interest will end when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity  if the property is not occupied 
purchase accounting acquisitions of rental property from third parties are accounted for at fair value 
any liabilities assumed or incurred are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition 
the fair value of the acquired property is allocated between land and building on an as if vacant basis based on management s estimate of the fair value of those components for each type of property and to tenant improvements based on the depreciated replacement cost of the tenant improvements  which approximates their fair value 
the fair value of the acquired property is recorded as follows the fair value of leases in place on the date of acquisition based on the leasing origination costs at the date of the acquisition  which approximates the fair value of the lease origination costs had the in place leases been originated on the date of acquisition  the fair value of in place leases represents absorption costs for the estimated lease up period in which vacancy and foregone revenue are incurred  the fair value of above and below market in place leases based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual rent amounts to be paid under the lease and the estimated market lease rates for the corresponding spaces over the remaining non cancelable terms of the related leases  which range from one to fourteen years  and the intangible fair value of tenant or customer relationships 
the company s determination of these fair values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  and depreciation and amortization expense recognized for these leases and associated intangible assets and liabilities 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company may enter into derivative agreements to mitigate exposure to unexpected changes in interest rates and may use interest rate protection or cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes 
the company intends to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that it believes have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 
the company may designate a derivative as either a hedge of the cash flows from a debt instrument or anticipated transaction cash flow hedge or a hedge of the fair value of a debt instrument fair value hedge 
all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
for effective hedging relationships  the change in the fair value of the assets or liabilities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  an element of shareholders equity cash flow hedge  or through earnings fair value hedge 
ineffective portions of derivative transactions will result in changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  the company has considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual inputs and guarantees 
share based compensation the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
for options awards the company uses a black sholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on an assessment of the company s realized volatility as well as analysis of a peer group of comparable entities 
the expected term represents the period of time the options are anticipated to remain outstanding as well as the company s historical experience for groupings of employees that have similar behavior and considered separately for valuation purposes 
for non vested share awards that vest over a predetermined time period  the company uses the outstanding share price at the date of issuance to fair value the awards 
for non vested shares awards that vest based on performance conditions  the company uses a monte carlo simulation risk neutral approach to determine the value and derived service period of each tranche 
the expense associated with the share based awards will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the fair value for all share based payment transactions are recognized as a component of income from continuing operations

liquidity and capital resources overview the company seeks to maintain a flexible balance sheet  with an appropriate balance of cash  debt  equity and available funds under its unsecured revolving credit facility  to readily provide access to capital given the volatility of the market and to position itself to address growth opportunities in the future 
the company expects to meet short term liquidity requirements generally through working capital  net cash provided by operations  and  if necessary  borrowings on its unsecured revolving credit facility 
the company s short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under the lease for its corporate headquarters  normal recurring operating expenses  regular debt service requirements  recurring expenditures  non recurring expenditures such as capital improvements  tenant improvements and redevelopments  leasing commissions and dividends to common shareholders 
over the next twelve months  the company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations and have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business  to fund its operating and administrative expenses  to continue to meet its debt service obligations and to pay distributions in accordance with reit requirements 
however  the company s cash flow from operations could be adversely affected in due to the ongoing economic downtown and the challenging financial and credit markets 
in particular  the company cannot assure that its tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses are challenged due to  among other things  the economic conditions particularly if the tenants are unable to secure financing to operate their businesses 
this may be particularly true for the company s tenants that are smaller companies 
further  approximately of the company s annualized base rent is scheduled to expire in and  if it is unable to renew these leases or re let the space  its cash flow could be negatively impacted 
the company intends to meet long term funding requirements for property acquisitions  development  redevelopment and other non recurring capital improvements through net cash from operations  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  including borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility  secured term loans  unsecured senior notes  proceeds from disposal of strategically identified assets  outright or through potential joint ventures  and the issuance of equity and debt securities 
the company s ability to raise funds through sales of debt and equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  rental rates  occupancy levels  market perceptions and the trading price of the company s shares 
the company will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to it at any particular point in time  but the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms the company deems attractive

cash flows due to the nature of the company s business  it relies on net cash provided by operations to fund its short term liquidity needs 
net cash provided by operations is substantially dependent on the continued receipt of rental payments and other expenses reimbursed by the company s tenants 
the recent economic downturn may affect tenants ability to meet their obligations  including the payment of rent contractually owed to the company  and the company s ability to lease space to new or replacement tenants on favorable terms  all of which could affect the company s cash available for short term liquidity needs 
although the recent economic downturn and uncertainty in the global credit markets has had varying impacts that have negatively impacted debt financing and the availability of capital across many industries  the company anticipates that its available cash flow from operating activities  and available cash from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet its capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
the company could also fund building acquisitions  development  redevelopment and other non recurring capital improvements through additional borrowings  issuance of operating partnership units or sales of assets  outright or through joint ventures

under the terms of the mortgage loan documents  a lender could assert that a prohibited transfer includes the trading of the company s common shares on the nyse  the issuance of common shares by the company  or the issuance of units of limited partnership interest in the company s operating partnership 
as of december   the company believes that there were twelve mortgage loans with such prohibited transfer provisions  representing an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately million 
two of these mortgage loans were entered into prior to the company s initial public offering ipo in and ten were assumed subsequent to its ipo 
in each instance  the company received the consent of the mortgage lender to consummate its ipo for the two pre ipo loans or to acquire the property or the ownership interests of the borrower for the post ipo loans  including the assumption by its subsidiary of the mortgage loan 
generally  the underlying mortgage documents  previously applicable to a privately held owner  were not changed at the time of the ipo or the later loan assumptions  although the company believes that each of the lenders or servicers was aware that the borrower s ultimate parent was or would become a publicly traded company 
subsequent to the ipo and the assumption of these additional mortgage loans  the company has issued new common shares and shares of the company have been transferred on the nyse 
similarly  the company s operating partnership has issued units of limited partnership interest 
to date  no lender or servicer has asserted that a prohibited transfer has occurred as a result of any such transfer of shares or units of limited partnership interest 
if a lender were to be successful in any such action  the company could be required to immediately repay or refinance the amounts outstanding  or the lender may be able to foreclose on the property securing the loan or take other adverse actions 
in addition  in certain cases a prohibited transfer could result in the loan becoming fully recourse to the company or its operating partnership 
further  if a violation of a prohibited transfer provision were to occur that would permit the company s mortgage lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them  it could result in an event of default under the company s senior unsecured series a and series b notes  its unsecured revolving credit facility  its two secured term loans and its exchangeable senior notes 
derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities in which its future exposure to interest rate fluctuations is unknown 
the objective in the use of an interest rate derivative is to add stability to interest expenses and manage exposure to interest rate changes 
no hedging activity can completely insulate the company from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
moreover  interest rate hedging could fail to protect the company or adversely affect it because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which the company seeks protection  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  and the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs the company s ability to sell or assign its side of the hedging transaction 
during  the company entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure on its variable rate debt against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the interest rate swap agreements fix libor to a specified interest rate  however  the swap agreements do not affect the contractual spreads associated with each variable debt instrument s applicable interest rate 
the table below summarizes the company s three interest rate swap agreements as of december  dollars in thousands interest rate contractual fixed effective transaction date maturity date amount component interest rate january august  libor august august  libor september september  libor the above table excludes the swap agreement associated with the million mortgage loan for riverspark ii  which was deconsolidated with the assets  liabilities and operating results of riverspark ii on march  off balance sheet arrangements on march   the company deconsolidated a joint venture that owns riverspark ii

the company also excludes  from its ffo calculation  any depreciation and amortization related to third parties from its consolidated joint venture 
the company considers ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assume that the fair value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate fair values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  the company believes that ffo provides a meaningful indication of its performance 
the company also considers ffo an appropriate performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s presentation of ffo in accordance with the nareit white paper  or as adjusted by the company  should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of its liquidity
