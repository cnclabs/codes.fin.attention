item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis is management s analysis of the financial performance of sunoco  inc and subsidiaries collectively  sunoco or the company and of significant trends that may affect its future performance 
it should be read in conjunction with sunoco s consolidated financial statements and related notes under item those statements in management s discussion and analysis that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
overview historically  sunoco s profitability has primarily been determined by refined product and chemical margins and the reliability and efficiency of its operations 
the volatility of crude oil  refined product and chemical prices and the overall supply demand balance for these commodities have had  and should continue to have  a significant impact on margins and the financial results of the company 
sunoco s profitability has been increasingly impacted by the growth in the level of earnings in its cokemaking operations 
during  refined product margins in sunoco s principal refining centers in the northeast and midwest were very strong 
such margins benefited from stringent fuel specifications related to sulfur reductions in gasoline and diesel products  strong premiums for ethanol blended gasoline  generally tight industry refined product inventory levels on a days supply basis and strong global refined product demand coupled with refinery maintenance capital improvement downtime  which led to reductions in spare industry refining capacity 
however  refined product margins declined significantly in the first half of in response to record high crude oil prices and softening global demand  strengthened in the second half of due to supply disruptions in the gulf coast attributable to hurricanes gustav and ike and declining crude oil prices  then declined sharply once again in in response to weak demand attributable to the global recession 
chemical margins were weak during most of the period in response to significantly higher feedstock costs and softening demand 
in and  cokemaking profitability benefited from increased price realizations from coke production at the company s jewell operations  which were largely driven by increases in coal prices  and a one time million investment tax credit 
the company believes the profitability of the refining and supply and chemicals businesses will continue to be challenged in due to volatility in the global marketplace causing ongoing weakness in product demand as well as the general oversupply of refined products due to increases in worldwide production capacity 
the absolute level of refined product and chemical margins is difficult to predict as they are influenced by extremely volatile factors  including the absolute level of crude oil and other feedstock prices  changes in industry production capacity  the effects of weather conditions on product supply and demand and the status of the global economy 
furthermore  excess capacity  increasing biofuels mandates and additional environmental regulations continue to adversely impact the refining industry 
these factors may prevent refiners  including sunoco  from earning their cost of capital and may lead to industry plant closures in the future 
cokemaking profitability is expected to continue to be strong as a new plant in granite city  il comes on stream  although coke segment profitability may be impacted by volatility of coal prices on the jewell coal and cokemaking operations 
the company s future operating results and capital spending plans will also be impacted by environmental matters see environmental matters below 
strategic actions sunoco is committed to improving its performance and enhancing its shareholder value while  at the same time  maintaining its financial strength and flexibility by striving to deliver excellence in health  safety and environmental performance  
table of contents increase reliability of company assets and realize additional operational improvements in each of its businesses  reduce expenses  efficiently manage capital spending to minimize outlays  diversify  upgrade and grow the company s asset base through strategic acquisitions and investments  divest assets that do not meet the company s return on investment criteria  and return cash to the company s shareholders primarily through the payment of cash dividends 
sunoco has undertaken the following initiatives as part of this strategy in the refining and supply business permanently shut down all process units at the eagle point refinery in the fourth quarter of in response to weak demand and increased global refining capacity 
in connection therewith  the company shifted production from eagle point to its marcus hook and philadelphia refineries 
the overall impact of this decision is expected to reduce the company s pretax expense base by approximately million per year  completed the sale of the tulsa refinery and related inventory in june and received million in cash proceeds from this divestment  and completed an acquisition totaling million in june of a million gallon per year ethanol manufacturing facility in new york 
the plant is expected to require approximately million in additional capital and is anticipated to start up in the summer of in the retail marketing business completed the sale of the retail heating oil and propane distribution business in september and received million in cash proceeds from this divestment  and continued to execute a retail portfolio management program in designed to enhance overall return on capital employed in the business 
under this program  sunoco is selectively reducing its invested capital in company owned or leased sites  while retaining most of the gasoline sales volumes attributable to the divested sites 
sunoco generated million of divestment proceeds related to the sale of sites during the period and expects to generate an additional million of proceeds  primarily over the next two years  from divestment activities 
in the chemicals business entered into an agreement in february to sell the polypropylene business for approximately million in cash which is expected to be completed on or about march   and permanently shut down in march the bayport  tx polypropylene plant 
in the logistics business completed acquisitions totaling million in the third quarter of of a crude oil pipeline which services gary williams wynnewood  ok refinery and a refined products terminal in romulus  mi  completed an acquisition totaling million in november of a refined products pipeline system  refined products terminal facilities and certain other related assets located in texas and louisiana  and completed construction in of a crude oil pipeline from the nederland terminal to motiva enterprise llc s port arthur  tx refinery and three related crude oil storage tanks at a total cost of million

table of contents refining and supply s segment results from continuing operations decreased million in primarily due to lower realized margins million and production volumes million  partially offset by lower expenses million 
production volumes decreased in as market driven rate reductions reduced production throughout the refining system 
during  sunoco continued its efforts to optimize its production slate and run a broader mix of lower cost crude oil grades resulting in an overall crude utilization rate of percent for this period 
the lower expenses were largely the result of lower costs for purchased fuel and utilities attributable to price declines and lower production volumes as well as the impact of the business improvement initiative 
in the fourth quarter of  sunoco permanently shut down all process units at the eagle point refinery in an effort to reduce losses in refining and supply at a time when weak demand and increased global refining capacity have created margin pressure on the entire refining industry

sunoco s working capital position is considerably stronger than indicated because of the relatively low historical costs assigned under the lifo method of accounting for most of the inventories reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
the current replacement cost of all such inventories exceeded their carrying value at december  by  million 
inventories valued at lifo  which consist of crude oil as well as petroleum and chemical products  are readily marketable at their current replacement values 
sunoco anticipates generating approximately million of cash in from the liquidation of inventories attributable to the permanent shutdown of the eagle point refinery  assuming current price levels 
in addition  the company expects to receive a federal income tax refund of approximately million during for the carryback of its net operating loss 
certain pending legislative and regulatory proposals effectively could limit  or even eliminate  use of the lifo inventory method for financial and income tax purposes 
although the final outcome of these proposals cannot be ascertained at this time  the ultimate impact to sunoco of the transition from lifo to another inventory method could be material 
cash flows from operating activities in  sunoco s cash generation was million compared to million in and  million in the million decrease in cash generation in was primarily due to a decrease in operating results  partially offset by a decrease in cash used to fund working capital levels and an increase in noncash charges 
the  million decrease in cash generation in was primarily due to an increase in working capital levels pertaining to operating activities 
increases in crude oil prices typically increase cash generation as the payment terms on sunoco s crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms on product sales 
conversely  decreases in crude oil prices typically result in a decline in cash generation 
crude oil prices increased in after decreasing in other cash flow information divestment activities also have been a source of cash 
during the period  proceeds from divestments totaled million and related primarily to the divestments of the tulsa refinery and related inventory and the retail heating oil and propane distribution business in as well as the sale of retail gasoline outlets throughout the period 
in  sunoco logistics partners lp issued million limited partnership units in a public offering  generating approximately million of net proceeds 
upon completion of this transaction  sunoco s interest in the partnership  including its percent general partnership interest  decreased to percent 
sunoco s general partnership interest also includes incentive distribution rights  which have provided sunoco  as the general partner  up to percent of the partnership s incremental cash flow 
sunoco received approximately  and percent of the partnership s cash distributions during  and  respectively  attributable to its limited and general partnership interests and its incentive distribution rights 
in february  sunoco received million in cash from the partnership in connection with a modification of the incentive distribution rights which was financed by the partnership s issuance of million of long term debt  consisting of million of percent notes due in and million of percent notes due in in february  sunoco also sold million of its limited partnership units to the public  generating approximately million of net proceeds  which further reduced its interest in the partnership to percent 
as a result of these two transactions  sunoco s share of partnership distributions is expected to be approximately percent at the partnership s current quarterly cash distribution rate 
the partnership acquired interests in various pipelines and other logistics assets during the period see capital program below 
the partnership expects to finance future growth opportunities with a combination of borrowings and the issuance of additional limited partnership units to the public to maintain a balanced capital structure 
any issuance of limited partnership units to the public would dilute sunoco s ownership interest in the partnership 

table of contents financial capacity management currently believes that future cash generation is expected to be sufficient to satisfy sunoco s ongoing capital requirements  to fund its pension obligations see retirement benefit plans below and to pay cash dividends on sunoco s common stock 
however  from time to time  the company s short term cash requirements may exceed its cash generation due to various factors including reductions in margins for products sold and increases in the levels of capital spending including acquisitions and working capital 
during those periods  the company may supplement its cash generation with proceeds from financing activities 
the company has a billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of participating banks the facility  of which billion matures in august with the balance to mature in august the facility provides the company with access to short term financing and is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper  letters of credit and other debt 
the company also can borrow directly from the participating banks under the facility 
the facility is subject to commitment fees  which are not material 
under the terms of the facility  sunoco is required to maintain tangible net worth as defined in the facility in an amount greater than or equal to targeted tangible net worth targeted tangible net worth being determined by adding billion and percent of the excess of net income attributable to sunoco  inc shareholders over share repurchases as defined in the facility for each quarter ended after march  
at december   the company s tangible net worth was billion and its targeted tangible net worth was billion 
the facility also requires that sunoco s ratio of consolidated net indebtedness  including borrowings of sunoco logistics partners lp  to consolidated capitalization as those terms are defined in the facility not exceed

to at december   the facility was being used to support million of commercial paper and million of floating rate notes due in floating rate notes totaling million were issued in april to replace similar notes that were redeemed during the first quarter of the company remarkets the floating rate notes on a weekly basis 
however  any inability to remarket the floating rate notes would have no impact on the company s liquidity as they currently represent a reduction in funds under the facility which would be available for future borrowings if the notes were repaid 
sunoco logistics partners lp has a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of participating banks  which expires in november this facility is available to fund the partnership s working capital requirements  to finance acquisitions  and for general partnership purposes 
amounts outstanding under this facility totaled and million at december  and  respectively 
in march  the partnership entered into an additional million revolving credit facility with two participating banks  which expires in september at december   there was million outstanding under this facility 
the million facility contains a covenant requiring the partnership to maintain a ratio not to exceed to of its consolidated total debt including letters of credit to its consolidated ebitda each as defined in the facility 
the million facility contains a similar covenant but the ratio in this covenant may not exceed to at december   the partnership s ratio of its consolidated debt to its consolidated ebitda was to in august  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sunoco receivables corporation  inc src  executed an agreement with two participating banks  extending an existing accounts receivable securitization facility that was scheduled to expire in august  by an additional days 
the updated facility permits borrowings and supports the issuance of letters of credit by src up to a total of million 
under the receivables facility  certain subsidiaries of the company will sell their accounts receivable from time to time to src 
in turn  src may sell undivided ownership interests in such receivables to commercial paper conduits in exchange for cash or letters of credit 
the company has agreed to continue servicing the receivables for src 
upon the sale of the interests in the accounts receivable by src  the conduits have a first priority perfected security interest in such receivables and  as a result  the receivables will not be available to the creditors of the company or its other subsidiaries 
at december   there were no borrowings under the receivables facility

operating leases include all operating leases that have initial noncancelable terms in excess of one year 
approximately percent of the million of future minimum annual rentals relates to time charters for marine transportation vessels 
most of these time charters contain terms of between three to seven years with renewal and sublease options 
the time charter leases typically require a fixed price payment or a fixed price minimum and a variable component based on spot market rates 
in the table above  the variable component of the lease payments has been estimated utilizing the average spot market prices for the year the actual variable component of the lease payments attributable to these time charters could vary significantly from the estimates included in the table

table of contents retirement benefit plans the following table sets forth the components of the change in market value of the investments in sunoco s defined benefit pension plans in millions of dollars december balance at beginning of year increase reduction in market value of investments resulting from net investment income loss company contributions plan benefit payments balance at end of year as a result of the poor performance of the financial markets during  the projected benefit obligation of the company s funded defined benefit plans at december  exceeded the market value of the plan assets by million 
in connection therewith  the company was required to recognize a million unfavorable after tax adjustment to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity at december  poor investment results for the plans during also resulted in an increase of approximately million after tax in pension expense for due to lower expected returns on plan assets and higher amortization of actuarial losses 
as a result of the workforce reduction  the sale of the tulsa refinery and the permanent shutdown of the eagle point refinery  the company incurred noncash settlement and curtailment losses in these plans during totaling approximately million after tax 
at december   the projected benefit obligation for the company s funded pension plans exceeded plan assets by million 
in early  the company contributed million to its funded defined benefit plans consisting of million of cash and million shares of sunoco common stock valued at million 
the company may make additional contributions to its funded defined benefit plans during the remainder of if it has available cash 
the company also has unfunded obligations for other defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plans which totaled million at december  there is no legal requirement to pre fund these plans which are funded as benefit payments are made 
effective june   pension benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans will be frozen for most of the participants in these plans at which time the company will institute a profit sharing contribution on behalf of these employees in its defined contribution plan 
postretirement medical benefits have also been phased down or eliminated for all employees retiring after july  there are currently no planned changes in benefits for any employees who retire prior to this date or for current retirees 
as a result of these changes  the company s pension and postretirement benefits liability declined approximately million in the fourth quarter of the benefit of this liability reduction will be amortized into income through the pretax cost of benefits earned net of the expected profit sharing contributions and interest on the existing obligations are expected to decline approximately million on an annualized basis as a result of these changes 
the reduction in service and interest cost will also increase the likelihood that settlement gains or losses  representing the accelerated amortization of deferred gains and losses  will be recognized in the future as previously earned lump sum payments are made 
environmental matters general sunoco is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  waste management and the characteristics and composition of fuels 
as with the industry generally  compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases the 
table of contents overall cost of operating sunoco s businesses  including remediation  operating costs and capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities 
existing laws and regulations have required  and are expected to continue to require  sunoco to make significant expenditures of both a capital and an expense nature 
the following table summarizes sunoco s expenditures for environmental projects and compliance activities in millions of dollars pollution abatement capital remediation operations  maintenance and administration capital expenditures for pollution abatement include amounts to comply with the consent decree pertaining to certain alleged clean air act violations at the company s refineries 
pollution abatement capital outlays are expected to approximate and million in and  respectively 
remediation activities information regarding remediation activities at sunoco s facilities and at formerly owned or third party sites is included in the discussion under environmental remediation activities in note to the consolidated financial statements item and is incorporated herein by reference 
regulatory matters through the operation of its refineries  chemical plants  marketing facilities  coke plants and coal mines  sunoco s operations emit greenhouse gases ghg  including carbon dioxide 
there are various legislative and regulatory measures to address ghg emissions which are in various stages of review  discussion or implementation 
current proposals being considered by congress include a cap and trade system that would begin in which would require the company to provide carbon emission allowances for emissions at its manufacturing facilities as well as emissions caused by the use of fuels it sells 
the cap and trade program would require affected businesses to buy emission credits from the government  other businesses or through an auction process 
while the exact amount of such costs would not be established until the future  the company believes that these costs could be material  and there is no assurance that the company would be able to recover them in the sale of its products 
other federal and state actions to develop programs for the reduction of ghg emissions are also being considered 
in addition  during  the epa indicated that it intends to regulate carbon dioxide emissions 
while it is currently not possible to predict the impact  if any  that these issues will have on the company or the industry in general  they could result in increases in costs to operate and maintain the company s facilities  as well as capital outlays for new emission control equipment at these facilities 
in addition  regulations limiting ghg emissions or carbon content of products  which target specific industries such as petroleum refining or chemical or coke manufacturing could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business and also may reduce demand for its products 
national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and fine particles promulgated by the epa have resulted in identification of non attainment areas throughout the country  including texas  pennsylvania  ohio  new jersey and west virginia  where sunoco operates facilities 
areas designated by epa as moderate non attainment for ozone  including philadelphia and houston  would be required to meet the ozone requirements by  before currently mandated federal control programs take effect 
in january  the epa issued a finding that the philadelphia and houston state implementation plans sips failed to demonstrate attainment by the deadline 
this finding is expected to result in more stringent offset requirements and could result in other negative consequences 
texas petitioned epa to redesignate the houston area as severe non attainment for ozone and in the epa granted the petition 
under this designation  houston s sip is due in and attainment must be achieved by in  the epa also identified numerous counties  including 
table of contents the county where the toledo refinery is located  that now are in attainment of the fine particles standard 
in september  the epa issued a final rule tightening the standard for fine particles 
this standard is currently being challenged in federal court by various states and environmental groups 
in march  the epa issued final rules to implement the fine particle matter pm standards 
states had until april to submit plans to the epa demonstrating attainment by or  at the latest  however  the march rule does not address attainment of the september standard 
in march  the epa promulgated a new  more stringent ozone standard  which was challenged in a lawsuit in may by environmental organizations 
regulatory programs  when established to implement the epa s air quality standards  could have an impact on sunoco and its operations 
however  the potential financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated until the lawsuit is resolved  the epa promulgates regulatory programs to attain the standards  and the states  as necessary  develop and implement revised sips to respond to the new regulations 
mtbe litigation information regarding certain mtbe litigation in which sunoco is a defendant is included in the discussion under mtbe litigation in note to the consolidated financial statements item and is incorporated herein by reference 
conclusion management believes that the environmental matters discussed above are potentially significant with respect to results of operations or cash flows for any one year 
however  management does not believe that such matters will have a material impact on sunoco s consolidated financial position or  over an extended period of time  on sunoco s cash flows or liquidity 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk sunoco uses swaps  options  futures  forwards and other derivative instruments to hedge a variety of commodity price risks 
derivative instruments are used from time to time to achieve ratable pricing of crude oil purchases  to convert certain expected refined product sales to fixed or floating prices  to lock in what sunoco considers to be acceptable margins for various refined products and to lock in the price of a portion of the company s electricity and natural gas purchases or sales and transportation costs 
sunoco does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
sunoco is at risk for possible changes in the market value of all of its derivative contracts  however  such risk would be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged items 
at december   sunoco had accumulated net derivative deferred losses  before income taxes  of less than million on all of its open derivative contracts 
open contracts as of december  vary in duration but generally do not extend beyond sunoco also is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by derivative counterparties 
management believes this risk is not significant as the company has established credit limits with such counterparties which require the settlement of net positions when these credit limits are reached 
as a result  the company had no significant derivative counterparty credit exposure at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements under item 
interest rate risk sunoco has market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its outstanding borrowings 
sunoco manages this exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   the company had  million of fixed rate debt and million of floating 
table of contents rate debt 
a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s fixed rate borrowings at december  by approximately million 
however  such change in interest rates would not have a material impact on income or cash flows as the majority of the outstanding borrowings consisted of fixed rate instruments 
sunoco also has market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to its retirement benefit plans see critical accounting policies retirement benefit liabilities below 
sunoco generally does not use derivatives to manage its market risk exposure to changing interest rates 
dividends and share repurchases the company has paid cash dividends regularly on a quarterly basis since the company reduced the quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from 
per share per year to 
per share 
per year beginning with the first quarter of the company had previously increased the quarterly cash dividend from 
per share to 
per share beginning with the second quarter of and then to 
per share beginning with the second quarter of the company s management believes that sunoco s current dividend level is sustainable under current conditions 
the company did not repurchase any of its common stock in in and  the company repurchased and million shares  respectively  of its common stock for and million  respectively 
at december   the company had a remaining authorization from its board to repurchase up to million of company common stock 
additional repurchases of company stock will be dependent on prevailing market conditions  available cash and the attractiveness of repurchasing stock relative to other investment alternatives 
the company currently has no plans to repurchase any of its common stock during critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements item 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of sunoco s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions consist of retirement benefit liabilities  long lived assets and environmental remediation activities 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ to some extent from the estimates on which the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared at any point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
management has reviewed the assumptions underlying its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of sunoco s board of directors 
retirement benefit liabilities sunoco has substantial obligations in connection with its funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
effective june   benefits under these plans will be frozen for most participants 
in addition  sunoco has postretirement benefit plans which provide health care benefits for substantially all of its current retirees 
medical benefits under these plans will also be phased down or eliminated for all employees retiring after july  there are currently no planned changes in benefits for any employees who retire prior to this date or for current retirees 
the postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and the costs are shared by sunoco and its retirees 
the levels of required retiree contributions to these plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
in addition  there is a dollar cap on sunoco s future contributions for its principal postretirement health care benefits plan  which significantly reduces the impact of future cost increases on the estimated postretirement benefit expense and benefit obligation 

table of contents the principal assumptions that impact the determination of both expense and benefit obligations for sunoco s pension plans are the discount rate and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate and the health care cost trend are the principal assumptions that impact the determination of expense and benefit obligations for sunoco s postretirement health care benefit plans 
the discount rates used to determine the present value of future pension payments and medical costs are based on a portfolio of high quality aa rated corporate bonds with maturities that reflect the duration of sunoco s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the present values of sunoco s future pension and other postretirement obligations were determined using discount rates of and percent  respectively  at december  and and percent  respectively  at december  sunoco s expense under these plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year  which for pension plans was percent for  percent for  percent for  and will be percent for  and for postretirement plans was percent for  percent for  percent for  and will be percent for the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was assumed to be percent for each of the last three years 
a long term expected rate of return of percent on plan assets is also expected to be used to determine sunoco s pension expense for the expected rate of return on plan assets is estimated utilizing a variety of factors including the historical investment return achieved over a long term period  the targeted allocation of plan assets and expectations concerning future returns in the marketplace for both equity and fixed income securities 
in determining pension expense  the company applies the expected rate of return to the market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year  which is determined using a quarterly average of plan assets from the preceding year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption 
it generally will differ from the actual annual return which is subject to considerable year to year variability 
for  the pension plan assets generated a positive return of percent  compared to a negative return of percent in and a positive return of percent in for the year period ended december   the compounded annual investment return on sunoco s pension plan assets was a positive return of percent 
as permitted by existing accounting rules  the company does not recognize currently in pension expense the difference between the expected and actual return on assets 
rather  the difference along with other actuarial gains or losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plans primarily the discount rate and differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
except as discussed below  if such actuarial gains and losses on a cumulative basis exceed percent of the projected benefit obligation  the excess is amortized into net income as a component of pension or postretirement benefits expense generally over the average remaining service period of plan participants still employed with the company  which currently is approximately years for the pension plans and approximately years for the postretirement benefit plans 
at december   the accumulated net actuarial loss for defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans was and million  respectively 
the accumulated net actuarial loss for the defined benefit plans reflects a million reduction attributable to a curtailment gain from the freeze in plan benefits described above 
sunoco is also required to accelerate the recognition of a portion of its cumulative actuarial losses into net income if the amount of pension liabilities settled in a given year is greater than the service and interest cost components of its defined benefit plans expense 
in  as a result of the workforce reduction  the sale of the tulsa refinery and the permanent shutdown of the eagle point refinery  the company incurred noncash settlement losses totaling million with respect to its defined benefit plans 
in addition  as a result of the above noted changes  the pretax cost of benefits earned and interest on the existing defined benefit pension plan obligations are expected to decline approximately million on an annualized basis 
this reduction in service and interest cost will also increase the likelihood that settlement gains or losses will be recognized in the future as previously earned lump sum payments are made 
sunoco has unrecognized prior service benefits attributable to its postretirement benefit plans of million at december   which includes approximately million attributable to the phase down or elimination 
table of contents of retiree medical benefits described above 
such benefits are being amortized over the remaining service period to full eligibility of plan participants which is approximately years 
the initial health care cost trend assumptions used to compute the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were increases of percent  percent and percent at december   and  respectively 
these trend rates were assumed to decline gradually to percent in and to remain at that level thereafter 
set forth below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement benefits expense and benefit obligations that would occur in from a change in the indicated assumptions dollars in millions change in rate expense benefit obligations pension benefits decrease in the discount rate decrease in the long term expected rate of return on plan assets postretirement benefits decrease in the discount rate increase in the annual health care cost trend rates represents the projected benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations for postretirement benefit plans 
long lived assets the cost of plants and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
changes in useful lives that do not result in the impairment of an asset are recognized prospectively 
there have been no significant changes in the useful lives of the company s plants and equipment during the period 
a decision to dispose of an asset may necessitate an impairment review 
in this situation  an impairment would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets  other than those held for sale  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  among other factors operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines  technological developments resulting in obsolescence  changes in demand for the company s products or in end use goods manufactured by others utilizing the company s products as raw materials  changes in the company s business plans or those of its major customers  suppliers or other business partners  changes in competition and competitive practices  uncertainties associated with the united states and world economies  changes in the expected level of capital  operating or environmental remediation expenditures  and changes in governmental regulations or actions 
additional factors impacting the economic viability of long lived assets are described under forward looking statements below 
a long lived asset that is not held for sale is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
such estimated future cash flows are highly subjective and are based on numerous assumptions about future operations and market conditions 
the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the impaired asset 
it is also difficult to precisely estimate fair market value because quoted market prices for the company s 
table of contents long lived assets may not be readily available 
therefore  fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets being reviewed for impairment 
sunoco had asset impairments totaling  and million after tax during  and  respectively 
the impairments in related primarily to the write down to estimated fair value of the eagle point refinery which was permanently shut down in the fourth quarter of as well as the write down of certain other assets primarily in the refining and supply business 
the estimated fair value of the eagle point assets is largely based upon an independent appraiser s use of observable current replacement costs of similar new equipment adjusted to reflect the age  condition  maintenance history and estimated remaining useful life 
as such  it reflects both observable and unobservable inputs and is therefore determined to be a level fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy under generally accepted accounting principles 
the impairments in related to the discontinued tulsa refining operations  which were sold on june   a polypropylene plant in bayport  tx which was permanently shut down in march  goodwill related to the company s polypropylene business  and certain retail marketing properties held for sale in the company s retail portfolio management program 
the impairment in related to the permanent shutdown of a previously idled phenol line at the company s haverhill  oh plant 
for a further discussion of these asset impairments  see note to the consolidated financial statements item 
sunoco also conducted impairment tests for its chemical assets during since the criteria for assets held for sale had not been met at december   the assets were tested to see if their undiscounted cash flows exceeded their carrying amounts 
with regard to its polypropylene chemical assets  the undiscounted cash flows were estimated assuming that a potential sale or continued operations were approximately equally likely 
sunoco s best estimate of future operating cash flows was prepared based upon the company s operating plan for the next three years and margins realized during the most recent six year business cycle 
under this scenario  the undiscounted cash flows were significantly greater than the related carrying amounts and no impairment was necessary 
on february   sunoco entered into an agreement to sell its polypropylene business to braskem sa for approximately million in cash 
sunoco expects to record a pretax loss on the sale in the first quarter of of approximately million 
the impairment test for the phenol chemicals business was prepared based upon sunoco s best estimate of future operating cash flows from its phenol plants over their expected useful lives 
the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows was prepared based upon the company s operating plan for the next three years and margins realized during the most recent six year business cycle 
while the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts of the assets  the margin was relatively narrow 
the company is currently pursuing opportunities to increase the profitability of this business 
however  given the sensitivity of the most recent impairment test  if phenol sales volumes and margins do not return to their historical levels  a significant writedown of the phenol assets could be required 
environmental remediation activities sunoco is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or that otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  waste management and the characteristics and composition of fuels 
these laws and regulations require environmental assessment and or remediation efforts at many of sunoco s facilities and at formerly owned or third party sites 
sunoco s accrual for environmental remediation activities amounted to million at december  this accrual is for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated that cleanup costs are probable and 
table of contents reasonably estimable 
the accrual is undiscounted and is based on currently available information  estimated timing of remedial actions and related inflation assumptions  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
it is often extremely difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs due to changing regulations  changing technologies and their associated costs  and changes in the economic environment 
in the above instances  if a range of probable environmental cleanup costs exists for an identified site  existing accounting guidance requires that the minimum of the range be accrued unless some other point in the range is more likely  in which case the most likely amount in the range is accrued 
engineering studies  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated accruals for environmental remediation activities 
losses attributable to unasserted claims are also reflected in the accruals to the extent they are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable 
management believes it is reasonably possible ie  less than probable but greater than remote that additional environmental remediation losses will be incurred 
at december   the aggregate of the estimated maximum additional reasonably possible losses  which relate to numerous individual sites  totaled approximately million 
however  the company believes it is very unlikely that it will realize the maximum reasonably possible loss at every site 
furthermore  the recognition of additional losses  if and when they were to occur  would likely extend over many years and  therefore  likely would not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
management believes that none of the current remediation locations  which are in various stages of ongoing remediation  is individually material to sunoco as its largest accrual for any one superfund site  operable unit or remediation area was less than million at december  as a result  sunoco s exposure to adverse developments with respect to any individual site is not expected to be material 
however  if changes in environmental laws or regulations occur  such changes could impact multiple sunoco facilities  formerly owned facilities and third party sites at the same time 
as a result  from time to time  significant charges against income for environmental remediation may occur 
under various environmental laws  including rcra  sunoco has initiated corrective remedial action at its facilities  formerly owned facilities and third party sites 
at the company s major manufacturing facilities  sunoco has consistently assumed continued industrial use and a containment remediation strategy focused on eliminating unacceptable risks to human health or the environment 
the remediation accruals for these sites reflect that strategy 
accruals include amounts to prevent off site migration and to contain the impact on the facility property  as well as to address known  discrete areas requiring remediation within the plants 
activities include closure of rcra solid waste management units  recovery of hydrocarbons  handling of impacted soil  mitigation of surface water impacts and prevention of off site migration 
many of sunoco s current terminals are being addressed with the above containment remediation strategy 
at some smaller or less impacted facilities and some previously divested terminals  the focus is on remediating discrete interior areas to attain regulatory closure 
sunoco owns or operates certain retail gasoline outlets where releases of petroleum products have occurred 
federal and state laws and regulations require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites and at formerly owned sites be assessed and remediated to meet the applicable standards 
the obligation for sunoco to remediate this type of contamination varies  depending on the extent of the release and the applicable laws and regulations 
a portion of the remediation costs may be recoverable from the reimbursement fund of the applicable state  after any deductible has been met 
in summary  total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon  among other things  the identification of any additional sites  the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site  the timing and nature of required remedial actions  the nature of operations at each site  the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements  the nature and terms of cost sharing arrangements 
table of contents with other potentially responsible parties  the availability of insurance coverage  the nature and extent of future environmental laws and regulations  inflation rates  terms of consent agreements or remediation permits with regulatory agencies and the determination of sunoco s liability at the sites  if any  in light of the number  participation level and financial viability of the other parties
