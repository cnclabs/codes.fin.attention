our commercial achievements for comprised the continued rollout of atripla in the european union including the launch of atripla in france  the growth of atripla and truvada product sales in the united states and canada  making gains in the pah market with letairis  as well as continuing the expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure 
we grew our product sales significantly and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international footprint and business activities 
in addition  we added ranexa to our product portfolio through the acquisition of cv therapeutics  inc cv therapeutics in april in february  we received marketing approval from the us food and drug administration fda for cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cf patients with p 
aeruginosa 
cayston was conditionally approved in europe and canada in september cayston is delivered via a specific inhalation device developed by pari pharma gmbh 

table of contents we also made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development r d pipeline  including in the hiv area  in january  we announced that both of the phase clinical studies of cobicistat formerly gs  our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain hiv medicines  and a complete single tablet fixed dose regimen containing elvitegravir  cobicistat and truvada in treatment na ve patients met their primary objectives of non inferiority 
pending discussion with the fda  we expect to initiate three phase studies before the middle of two studies for the single tablet fixed dose regimen mentioned above and one study for cobicistat 
in december  we completed enrollment in the phase study evaluating elvitegravir in treatment experienced patients 
in addition  in collaboration with tibotec pharmaceuticals tibotec  we are developing a new once daily fixed dose combination containing our truvada and tibotec s investigational non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  tmc mg rilpivirine hydrochloride  which is currently in phase clinical trials 
subject to positive outcome of this study  we intend to submit marketing applications for the fixed dose combination of truvada and tmc in the united states and europe during the second half of in the liver disease area  we completed the phase a studies of gs  the caspase inhibitor we licensed from lg life sciences  ltd 
in  that is in development for the treatment of hepatitis c and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and expect to present the results in the second quarter of we are continuing the phase b study of gs for the treatment of hepatitis c 
we are also continuing our phase study of gs  a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of hepatitis c infection  and expect to complete the study in the second half of in the cardiovascular and metabolic areas  we expanded our product candidate portfolio through the acquisition of cv therapeutics 
we anticipate commencing patient enrollment in a phase study of ranolazine for the treatment of diastolic heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction in the second quarter of we are continuing our phase study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf 
we are also collaborating with gsk to develop a clinical trial to study combination therapy versus monotherapy in a first line treatment setting for pah 
the study  ambition  will evaluate first line combination use with ambrisentan  an endothelin receptor antagonist era  and tadalafil  a pde inhibitor  in patients with pah 
we are continuing our phase study of cicletanine hydrochloride  an oral agent in development for the treatment of pah 
we announced plans to terminate development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension after our second phase study of the compound failed to meet its co primary efficacy endpoints 
in may  we announced that our marketing authorization application for regadenoson  an investigational pharmacologic stress agent for radionuclide mpi  was validated by the european medicines agency emea 
following validation of the marketing authorization application  the dossier is distributed to members of the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp for formal review to determine whether regadenoson is a safe and efficacious pharmacologic stress agent in humans 
in the respiratory area  we are continuing the phase study of ambrisentan for the treatment of ipf and anticipate completing enrollment of patients in this study by the end of we are continuing the phase study of gs  an inhaled co formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin  for the treatment of bacterial infections associated with cf  the phase study of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis and the phase study of gs  an oral epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease 
acquisition of cv therapeutics and restructuring in april  we completed the acquisition of cv therapeutics  a publicly held biopharmaceutical company based in palo alto  california  primarily focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular  metabolic and pulmonary diseases 
cv therapeutics 
table of contents had two marketed products as well as several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular  metabolic and pulmonary diseases 
we believe the acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area 
we adopted the new business combinations guidance for recognizing and measuring assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree and applied it to the cv therapeutics acquisition 
as a result  we recognized consideration transferred of billion and recorded million and million in intangible assets relating to marketed products and in process research and development ipr d projects  respectively  which constituted a significant portion of the assets acquired from cv therapeutics 
the results of operations of cv therapeutics beginning on april   the acquisition date  were included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we approved a plan to realize certain synergies between cv therapeutics and us  re align our cardiovascular operations and eliminate certain redundancies 
the restructuring plan included consolidation and re alignment of the cardiovascular r d organization  our exit from certain facilities and the termination of certain contractual obligations 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded million and million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses and r d expenses  respectively  in  primarily related to employee severance  relocation and termination benefits  lease termination costs and other facilities related expenses 
we expect to incur an additional million in bringing the total amount to be incurred in connection with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately million for employee severance  relocation and termination benefits and million for facilities related expenses 
financial highlights our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of billion 
antiviral product sales truvada  atripla  viread  hepsera and emtriva increased to billion in from billion in  and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of for as compared to with the continued uptake of atripla in the united states and europe  atripla contributed billion  or  to our total antiviral product sales 
the growth of atripla product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease to in from in  due primarily to the efavirenz component of atripla sales at zero gross margin 
truvada product sales for comprised billion  or of our total antiviral product sales 
truvada product sales for increased from primarily due to continued sales volume growth in the united states and europe 
foreign currency fluctuations in had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on total revenues and million on pre tax income when compared to royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were million in  an increase of from royalty revenues of million in the increase in royalty revenues was due primarily to increased tamiflu sales by roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide 
operating expenses increased million in  or  compared to  reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development pipeline  our expanded commercial activities worldwide  as well as the higher headcount  infrastructure and technology related costs required to support the continued growth of our business 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million during the year  driven primarily by our operating cash flows of billion partially offset by cash used to acquire cv therapeutics of billion  net of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from cv therapeutics of million  and million used to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock through open market purchases under the now completed billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors board in october 
table of contents outlook our operating objectives for include increasing the market share of our commercial products  continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and or externally in licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances 
from a commercial standpoint  we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises 
in the hiv area  we expect a favorable impact from our updated atripla label that includes data from study supporting switching patients from other hiv regimens to atripla  revised us department of health and human services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier treatment for patients with hiv and the extension of the ryan white treatment act which should provide stable funding for aids drug assistance programs in the united states through in the hepatitis b virus hbv area  we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on asian communities  highlighting the need to screen  diagnose and link patients to care 
as part of those efforts  we will have a larger hepatitis b field team in in the united states 
in the cardiovascular area  we will continue in our efforts to raise awareness of gilead in the pah and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of letairis and ranexa in we are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals 
some of the factors that could affect our business include the potential healthcare reform in the united states  continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor these factors and will adjust our business processes to mitigate these risks to our business 
the successes we experienced in have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial  collaborative and r d activities and to maintain quality and compliance 
as we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage  we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals  our tax provision and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer 
table of contents incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management 
government rebates we estimate reductions to our revenues for government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal  state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
these reductions are settled either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge backs from our wholesalers 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the united states  to date  payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates 
for government programs in the united states  we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during  and  u 
s government rebates of million  million and million  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales 
we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued us government rebates of million and million  respectively  in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our us government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total intangible assets in conjunction with business combinations that we have completed  we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products  ipr d projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
identifiable intangible assets  such as those 
table of contents related to marketed products or ipr d projects  are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
we believe the fair values assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates  the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts 
as of december   we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets consisting of million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and million of intangible assets related to the ipr d projects that we acquired from cv therapeutics 
of the million of ipr d intangible assets that we acquired from cv therapeutics  million related to gs formerly cvt  a product candidate in phase clinical studies for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia 
the remaining balance of the intangible assets related to the ipr d projects represented various other in process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value 
the estimated fair value of the ipr d intangible assets acquired from cv therapeutics was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
we estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a present value discount rate of  which is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of cv therapeutics 
this is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for cv therapeutics operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets 
we compensated for the differing phases of development of each project by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each project 
we then determined the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 
the projected cash flows from the ipr d projects were based on various estimates and assumptions including those noted above 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are amortizing the intangible asset related to the ranexa product  which we acquired from cv therapeutics  over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for ranexa 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold  as that is where we record the amortization expense 
we are amortizing the intangible asset related to the lexiscan product  which we also acquired from cv therapeutics  over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a 
table of contents straight line basis 
given that current lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and visibility into that partner s future sales forecasts  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach 
as of december   we had million of net unamortized finite lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from cv therapeutics 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results  our extent or manner of use of the acquired assets  legal and regulatory factors and events  our overall business strategy and market and economic trends 
if events occur in the future that cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory university emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
the present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital 
we review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty 
some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor  significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls 
we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods sold  as that is where we record the amortization expense 
as of december  and  we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory of million and million  respectively 
amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cros 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining clinical activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose phase clinical study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase clinical study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of truvada  atripla  viread  hepsera  emtriva  letairis and ranexa 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated 
some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract 
such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we may have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
such an adjustment was made in and when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore  we released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately million for and an income tax benefit of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax 

table of contents at december  and  we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively  including interest of million and million  respectively 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits  million and million at december  and  respectively  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
in  we reached agreement with the internal revenue service irs on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for through we also amended our california income tax returns for through based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the irs 
as a result  we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by million in as of december   we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately million in the next months as we expect to have clarification from the irs around certain of our uncertain tax positions 
with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits  we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective tax authorities 
we file federal  state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad 
for federal income tax purposes  the statute of limitations is open for and onward 
for certain acquired entities  the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years 
for california income tax purposes  the statute of limitations remains open for all years 
our income tax returns are audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the irs for the  and tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result  significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
stock based compensation we measure all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  based on their relative fair values 
fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected award life 
stock based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for non vested stock options granted prior to january   and using the straight line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share based payments to employees and directors on january  as stock based compensation expenses related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual 
table of contents forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
prior to the adoption of this guidance  pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred 
as a result of the guidance adopted on january   we only recognize a tax benefit from stock based compensation in additional paid in capital apic if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our consolidated statements of income rather than through apic 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses  and we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  to inventory 
as of december   we had unrecognized stock based compensation expenses of million related to non vested stock options  which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of years 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies 
results of operations total revenues we had total revenues of billion in  billion in and billion in included in total revenues were product sales  royalty revenues and contract and other revenues 
product sales the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales in thousands change change antiviral products truvada atripla viread hepsera emtriva total antiviral products ambisome letairis ranexa other total product sales total product sales increased by in compared to and by in compared to  due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product sales including the strong growth of atripla sales as well as the continued growth of truvada sales 
foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net loss from the appreciation of the us dollar of approximately million for compared to  and a net benefit from the depreciation of the us dollar of approximately million for compared to a significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies 
we used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in euro 
this reduced  but did not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents antiviral products antiviral product sales increased in compared to and by in compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth of atripla and truvada 
the increase in compared to was also due to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact

truvada sales accounted for  and of our total antiviral product sales for  and  respectively 
atripla atripla sales increased by in compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth in the united states and europe 
the european growth benefited from the launch of atripla in france in the second quarter of atripla sales increased by in compared to  driven primarily by the continued uptake of atripla in the united states  as well as launches of the product in most european countries 
atripla sales include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin 
the efavirenz portion of our atripla sales was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
atripla sales accounted for  and of our total antiviral product sales for  and  respectively 
other antiviral products other antiviral product sales  which include product sales of viread  hepsera and emtriva decreased by for compared to  driven primarily by sales volume decreases in hepsera  partially offset by sales volume increases in viread for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b 
other antiviral product sales increased by in compared to  driven primarily by a increase in hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable foreign currency exchange impact as well as sales volume growth in certain european countries 
ambisome sales of ambisome increased in compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain european markets  partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact 
sales of ambisome increased in compared to  driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain european markets 
ambisome product sales in the united states and canada relate solely to our sales of ambisome to astellas pharma us  inc which are recorded at our manufacturing cost 
letairis sales of letairis for the treatment of pah increased by for compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth in the united states 
sales of letairis increased in compared to  driven primarily by sales volume growth in the united states as letairis was launched in june of ranexa sales of ranexa were million for the period from april  the date of our acquisition of cv therapeutics to december  we expect total product sales to continue to grow in as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 

table of contents royalty revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues in thousands change change royalty revenues our most significant source of royalty revenues for  and was from sales of tamiflu by roche

our product gross margin for was compared to for the decrease in product gross margin was due primarily to the higher proportion of atripla sales  which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin  and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of our product sales 
a higher mix of atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin 
although we record of atripla product sales  we only benefit from the product gross margin on the truvada portion of atripla sales 
the efavirenz portion of atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since we purchase efavirenz from bristol myers squibb company bms at bms s net selling price of efavirenz 
we expect our product gross margin in to be lower compared to  due primarily to a higher proportion of expected atripla sales

we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our r d efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies  and costs associated with the defense  settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations

table of contents at december   we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related items 
these amounts represent minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing  collaboration and development arrangements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity under accounting standards codification asc section these amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis  and require an ongoing reassessment of whether the entity is a primarily beneficiary 
the amended standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we have been consolidating our joint ventures with bms because we are the primary beneficiary 
we are still evaluating whether the revised standard will have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables 
these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  however early adoption is permitted 
we have not yet evaluated whether these new standards will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  
table of contents the most significant of which is the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales 
we also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid 
in general  the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  weighted average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at december  we had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at december  all contracts have maturities of months or less 
weighted average rates are stated in terms of the amount of us dollars per foreign currency 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars and in thousands foreign currency exchange forward contracts currency notional amount weighted average settlement price fair value euro british pound canadian dollar australian dollar swiss franc danish krone swedish krone norwegian krone new zealand dollar turkish lira total the total notional amount of billion and total fair value relating to our net liability of million on our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts at december  compares with the total notional amount of billion and total fair value relating to our net asset of million on our open foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts at december  interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to our investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating  maturity  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 

table of contents the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest generating assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  dollars in thousands years ending december  thereafter total total fair value at december  assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes average interest rate in april  we issued the notes in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of and for the notes and notes  respectively  and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances 
credit risk a portion of our marketable securities consist of auction rate securities 
in  we began observing the failed auctions for auction rate securities whose underlying assets are comprised of student loans 
as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities within our available for sale long term marketable securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans 
our auction rate securities comprised approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failed auctions  are currently rated aaa  consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy  are supported by the federal government as part of the federal family education loan program  and are over collateralized 
our auction rate securities reset every seven to days with maturity dates ranging from through and have annual interest rates ranging from to 
as of december   our auction rate securities continued to earn interest 
if auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par  should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
however  based on our total cash and marketable securities position  our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility  we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities  which may be at final maturity 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material effect on our cash requirements or working capital 
in light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets  we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities carefully and strive to invest prudently 
we believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy  safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  as well as liquidity  has protected us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities such as the acquisition of cv therapeutics in our accounts receivable balance at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  the growth in our accounts receivable balance was due primarily to higher product sales of our antiviral products in the united states and europe 
our european product sales to government owned or supported customers in greece  italy  portugal and spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
this has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding 
this  in turn  may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in these countries in europe that tend to pay relatively slowly have increased  and may continue to further increase 
at december  
table of contents  our accounts receivable for greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled million  of which million was more than days past due based on contractual payment terms 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that our accounts receivable  net of allowances  as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  are collectible
