this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary this summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the company

table of contents the following are major factors that impacted the company s results of operations net interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to compression of the net interest margin 
net interest income was relatively flat in compared to  primarily due to a lower net interest margin  mostly offset by an increase in the volume of interest earning assets as a result of the merger with diablo valley bank and significant new loan production 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in the net interest margin for compared to was primarily due to the basis points decline in short term interest rates from january  through december   with the prime rate remaining at a historically low level of for all of the net interest margin also declined in due to an increase in nonaccrual loans 
the net interest margin for was  a decrease of basis points from for  primarily due to the decline in short term interest rates 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and a credit provision for loan losses of  in the significant increase in provision for loan losses in reflects a higher volume of classified and nonperforming loans and an increase in loan charge offs caused by challenging conditions in commercial lending and the residential housing market  turmoil in the financial markets  and the prolonged downturn in the overall economy 
noninterest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest income in compared to was primarily due to million in gains on the sale of sba loans in noninterest income decreased by in to million  compared to million in  primarily a result of no gains on the sale of sba loans in noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher fdic deposit insurance costs 
operating expenses increased in from million in due to the full year impact of the acquisition of diablo valley bank on june   including an increase in amortization of intangible assets  the new office in walnut creek  the addition of experienced banking professionals  the write off of leasehold improvements due to the consolidation of our two offices in los altos  higher fdic insurance costs  and an increase in legal fees and oreo expense 
the efficiency ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the efficiency ratio increased in and primarily due to lower net interest income  higher professional fees and increased fdic deposit insurance premiums 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   and income tax expense of million in the effective income tax rate for was 
the negative effective income tax rate of for was due to reduced pre tax earnings 
the effective tax rate for was 
the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of is primarily the result of the company s investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships  and interest income from tax free loans and municipal securities 

table of contents the following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position total assets decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  total loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  land and construction loans decreased million from million at december  to million at december  the allowance for loan losses increased to million  or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  nonperforming assets increased to million  or of total assets at december   from million  or of total assets at december  net loan charge offs increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  deposits decreased to billion at december   compared to billion at december  the ratio of noncore funding which consists of time deposits  and over  cdars deposits  brokered deposits  securities under agreement to repurchase  notes payable and short term borrowings to total assets was at december   compared to at december  the loan to deposit ratio was at december   compared to at december  as of december   hbc had a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as of december   hcc had a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of 
deposits the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics 
except for brokered time deposits  the company s depositors are generally located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company also obtains deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
the company had million in brokered deposits at december   compared to million at december  deposits from title insurance companies  escrow accounts and real estate exchange facilitators decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to deposit concentrations 
hbc is a member of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
deposits gathered through this program are considered brokered deposits under regulatory guidelines 
deposits in the cdars program totaled million at december   and million at december  hbc is a participant in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provides hbc s depositors with unlimited fdic insurance coverage for certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
unless extended by the fdic  the tagp will expire on june   at which time 
table of contents the amount of coverage for each depositor will be limited to  the impact of the tagp expiration in june could have an adverse effect on hbc s deposit base 
liquidity our liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion 
we believe that our liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses  borrowing needs and other obligations for at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in available borrowing capacity from various sources including the fhlb  the federal reserve  and federal funds facilities with several financial institutions 
the company also had million in unpledged securities available at december  our loan to deposit ratio decreased to at december  compared to at december   primarily due to a million reduction in the loan portfolio 
lending our lending business originates primarily through our branch offices located in our primary market 
the company also has sba loan production offices in sacramento  oakland and santa rosa  california 
as a result of the weakened economy in our primary service area throughout and and loan payoffs  we have seen a contraction in our loan portfolio during and this trend may continue through in addition to managing the growth of our loan portfolio during  we actively managed the mix of our loan portfolio 
at december   commercial loans accounted for of the total loan portfolio  and commercial real estate loans of which are owner occupied accounted for of the portfolio 
we have actively lowered our exposure to land and construction loans and our overall credit risk on these portfolios has been reduced 
land and construction loans decreased million for the year ended december   compared to december   and accounted for of our loan portfolio 
we expect the decreasing trend in land and construction loans to continue through net interest income the management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company s total revenue 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
because of our focus on commercial lending to closely held businesses  the company will continue to have a high percentage of floating rate loans and other assets 
given the current volume  mix and repricing characteristics of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  we believe our interest rate spread is expected to increase in a rising rate environment  and decrease in a declining interest rate environment 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail under liquidity and asset liability management 
in addition  we believe there are measures and initiatives we can take to improve the net interest margin  including increasing loan rates  adding floors on floating rate loans  reducing nonperforming assets  managing deposit interest rates  and reducing higher cost deposits 
from january  through december   the board of governors of the federal reserve system reduced short term interest rates by basis points 
this decrease in short term rates immediately affected the rates applicable to the majority of the company s loans 
while the decrease in interest rates also lowered the cost of interest bearing deposits  which represents the company s primary funding source  
table of contents these deposits tend to price more slowly than floating rate loans 
the rapid  substantial drop in short term interest rates  including the prime rate  has significantly compressed the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short term investments 
management of credit risk we continue to proactively identify  quantify  and manage our problem loans 
early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and ultimate losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
while we strive to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating  at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that may result in losses  but that have not yet been identified as potential problem loans 
through established credit practices  we attempt to identify deteriorating loans and adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly 
however  because future events are uncertain  there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame 
as a result  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate  construction and land development loans with relatively large balances  deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses 
future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as have resulted due to the current  and potentially worsening  economic conditions 
additionally  federal and state banking regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge offs based upon their judgments  which may be different from ours 
any increase in the allowance for loan losses would have an adverse effect  which may be material  on our financial condition and results of operation 
further discussion of the management of credit risk appears under provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income is an important component 
prior to the third quarter of  a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income was associated with its sba lending activity  consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing retained 
from the third quarter of through the second quarter of  the company retained its sba production 
in the third quarter of  the company began to again sell loans in the secondary market 
during the third and fourth quarters of  sba loans were sold resulting in a net gain on sale of loans of million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to sell loans in the secondary market in to enhance liquidity and improve noninterest income 
other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees  service charges and fees  and cash surrender value from company owned life insurance policies 
noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company s performance 
during the last several quarters  the company has undertaken several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve its efficiency 
nonetheless  noninterest expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to a substantial increase in fdic deposit insurance premiums  increased professional fees  and loan workout expense resulting from 
table of contents the current credit cycle 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the efficiency ratio increased year to year primarily due to compression of the company s net interest margin  and higher professional fees and increased fdic insurance premiums 
capital management as part of its asset and liability process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue 
at december   hbc s total risk based capital ratio was  compared to the regulatory requirement for well capitalized banks under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective actions 
hbc s tier risk based capital ratio of and our leverage ratio of at december  also exceeded regulatory guidelines for well capitalized banks under the prompt corrective actions framework 
on a consolidated basis  the company has a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of at december  on november   the company issued to the us treasury under its capital purchase program  shares of series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of for million 
the terms of the us treasury capital purchase program could reduce investment returns to our shareholders by restricting dividends to common shareholders  diluting existing shareholders interests  and restricting capital management practices 
in april  the board of directors suspended the quarterly dividend on our common stock  commencing with the second quarter of  to build capital and further strengthen our balance sheet 
in november  we exercised our right to defer interest payments on our outstanding trust preferred subordinated debt and our right to suspend payment of dividends on our series a preferred stock 
we do not expect to resume paying cash dividends on our common stock or series a preferred stock or interest on our trust preferred subordinated debt for the near term  and future dividends and interest payments will depend on sufficient earnings to support them and prior approval of the federal reserve 
we believe these actions will further enhance our capital levels during the current economic challenges 
results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is noninterest income  which primarily consists of gains on the sale of sba loans  loan servicing fees  customer service charges and fees  the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and gains on the sale of securities 
the majority of the company s noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products that comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid 
the following distribution  rate and yield table presents for each of the past three years  the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company s balance sheet  the average interest rates 
table of contents earned or paid thereon  and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated

the decrease in the net interest margin in compared to was primarily due to the basis points decline in short term interest rates from january  through december   with the prime rate remaining at a historically low level of for all of the company s net interest margin  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  was in compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
the net interest margin was also lower in due to an increase in nonaccrual loans 
a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price when the company s prime lending rate is changed  in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this causes the company s balance sheet to be asset sensitive which means that  all else being equal  the company s net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 

table of contents the net interest margin decreased basis points to in from in net interest income decreased  for to million from million for  primarily due to the basis points decline in short term interest rates from september  through december   partially offset by a increase in average interest earning assets in from provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are promptly charged off against the allowance 
the loan loss provision is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current quarter s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the loan loss provision and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the company s market area 
for  the company had a provision for loan losses of million  compared to a provision for loan losses of million for and a credit provision for loan losses of  for the significant increase in provision for loan losses in reflects a higher volume of classified and nonperforming loans and an increase in loan charge offs caused by challenging conditions in commercial lending and the residential housing market  turmoil in the financial markets  and the prolonged downturn in the overall economy

noninterest income the following table sets forth the various components of the company s noninterest income noninterest income year ended december  increase decrease versus increase decrease versus amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands service charges and fees on deposit accounts increase in cash surrender value of life insurance servicing income gain on sale of sba loans    n a  gain on sale of securities n a n a other total the increase in noninterest income in compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in gain on sale of sba loans 
there was no gain on sale of sba loans in  and a million gain on sale of sba loans in other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees  service charges and fees  and the cash surrender value from company owned life insurance policies 

table of contents historically  a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income has been associated with its sba lending activity  as gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing rights retained 
from the third quarter of through the second quarter of  the company changed its strategy regarding its sba loan business by retaining new sba production in lieu of selling the loans 
reflecting the strategic shift to retain sba loan production  there were no gains from sales of loans during and for the first six months of the company transferred million of sba loans to loans held for sale in the second quarter of to enhance its liquidity position and improve noninterest income in future periods 
during the third and fourth quarters of  sba loans were sold resulting in a net gain on sale of million for the year ended december  we expect to continue to sell loans in the secondary market in to enhance liquidity and improve noninterest income 
the servicing assets that result from the sale of sba loans  with servicing retained  are amortized over the expected term of the loans using a method approximating the interest method 
servicing income generally declines as the respective loans are repaid 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts were higher during compared to  due to higher fees from accounts on analysis as a result of lower interest rates and fewer waived fees 
lower interest rates generally result in lower earnings credits and higher net fees for services provided to clients 
the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance approximates a after tax yield on the policies 
to realize this tax advantaged yield  the policies must be held until death of the insured individuals  who are current and former officers and directors of the company 
the decrease in noninterest income in compared to was primarily attributable to a million decrease in gain on sale of sba loans 
noninterest expense the following table sets forth the various components of the company s noninterest expense noninterest expense year ended december  increase decrease versus increase decrease versus amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment professional fees deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments low income housing investment losses data processing software subscription advertising and promotion other total

salaries and employee benefits increased  for  compared to  primarily due to reduced capitalized loan origination costs  partially offset by lower bonuses and lower k plan contributions 
the company reduced bonuses for management and employees resulting in a bonus expense of  in  compared to million in there were no k plan contributions for employees in  compared to  of contributions in salaries and employee benefits increased million for  compared to  primarily due to the full year impact from the acquisition of diablo valley bank  opening a new branch in walnut creek  and the hiring of experienced bankers 
there were full time equivalent employees at december   a reduction of full time equivalent employees from at december  and december  occupancy  furniture and equipment decreased  in compared to primarily due to the consolidation of our two offices in los altos in the third quarter of the  increase in compared to was a result of the write off of leasehold improvements in the third quarter of due to the consolidation of our two offices in los altos and the full year impact of the acquisition of diablo valley bank and the opening of our walnut creek office in august professional fees increased  for from the increase in professional fees was primarily due to legal fees related to loan workouts and litigation  a branch acquisition transaction that was terminated in the second quarter of and increased expenses for bank regulatory compliance 
more frequent testing for goodwill impairment  with the assistance of a valuation firm  also increased professional fees in compared to professional fees increased  for  compared to  primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of diablo valley bank  and legal services related to our recovery efforts on million of defaulted loans from one borrower and his related entities 
deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments increased  or million for from the increase in deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments is primarily due to the special assessment imposed on each depository institution to help maintain public confidence in the federal deposit insurance system 
the special assessment was based on total assets minus tier capital as of june  this special assessment resulted in a  negative impact to our pre tax earnings during the second quarter of and was paid on september  additionally  increases in the 
table of contents fdic deposit assessment rate during the second quarter of contributed to the increase in deposit insurance premiums 
fdic insurance costs are expected to increase further in advertising and promotion decreased  in from  and decreased  in from  as a result of management s effort to control costs 
income tax expense the company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  the effective tax rate is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt interest income  increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
the company s federal and state income tax benefit in was million  as compared to million in  and income tax expense of million in the effective income tax rate for was 
the negative effective income tax rate of for was due to reduced pre tax earnings 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of is primarily the result of the company s investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships and investments in tax free municipal securities 
tax exempt interest income is generated primarily by the company s investments in state  county and municipal loans and securities  which provided  in federal tax exempt income in and  in and  in although not included in the securities portfolio  the company also has total investments of million in low income housing limited partnerships as of december  these investments have generated annual tax credits of approximately million in  and the investments are expected to generate an additional million in aggregate tax credits from through  however  the amount of the credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with certainty 
some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense or benefit  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse 
at the end of  the company had a net deferred tax asset of million  compared to a deferred tax asset of million at the end of financial condition as of december   total assets were billion  a decrease of from billion at year end total securities available for sale at fair value were million  an increase of from million at year end the total loan portfolio  excluding loans held for sale  was billion  a decrease of from billion at year end total deposits were billion  a decrease of from billion at year end securities sold under agreement to repurchase decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at year end securities portfolio the following table reflects the estimated fair value for each category of securities for the past three years

the portfolio serves the following purposes i it can be readily reduced in size to provide liquidity for loan balance increases or deposit decreases  ii it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender  iii it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool  since it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  iv it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans  and v it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company s securities are all currently classified under existing accounting rules as available for sale to allow flexibility for the management of the portfolio 
accounting guidance requires available for sale securities to be marked to fair value with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
monthly adjustments are made to reflect changes in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
the company s portfolio is historically comprised primarily of i us treasury securities and government sponsored entities debt securities for liquidity and pledging  ii mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  iii municipal obligations  which provide tax free income and limited pledging potential  and iv collateralized mortgage obligations  which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio 

table of contents the company increased its holding of mortgage back securities and decreased its us government sponsored securities from million to million to take advantage of higher yields during except for us government sponsored entities  no securities of a single issuer exceeded of shareholders equity at december  the company has no direct exposure to so called subprime loans or securities  nor does it own any fannie mae or freddie mac equity securities

the company does not have any concentrations by industry or group of industries in its loan portfolio  however  of its gross loans were secured by real property as of december   compared to as of december  while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
the company s commercial loans are made for working capital  financing the purchase of equipment or for other business purposes 
commercial loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans with maturities normally ranging from one to five years 
short term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments  with interest payable monthly

the company is an active participant in the sba and us department of agriculture guaranteed lending programs  and has been approved by the sba as a lender under the preferred lender program 
the company regularly makes such guaranteed loans collectively referred to as sba loans 
prior to the third quarter of  the guaranteed portion of these loans were sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions 
when the guaranteed portion of an sba loan was sold  the company retained the servicing rights for the sold portion 
from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  the company changed its strategy regarding its sba loan business by retaining new sba production in lieu of selling the loans 
during the second quarter of  the company transferred million of sba loans to loans held for sale to enhance its liquidity and improve noninterest income in future periods 
during the third and fourth quarters of  sba loans were sold resulting in a net gain on sale of million 
the company presently expects to continue to sell sba loans during as of december   real estate mortgage loans of million consist primarily of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by deeds of trust on commercial property 
the real estate mortgage loans at december  consist of million  or  of owner occupied properties  million  or  of investment properties  and million  or  in other properties 
properties securing the commercial real estate mortgage loans are primarily located in the company s primary market  which is the greater san francisco bay area 
the company s real estate mortgage loans consist primarily of loans based on the borrower s cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment 
the company generally restricts real estate term loans to no more than of the property s appraised value or the purchase price of the property during the initial underwriting of the credit  depending on the type of property and its utilization 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans 
maturities on real estate mortgage loans are generally between five and ten years with amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty five years and a balloon payment due at maturity  however  sba and certain other real estate loans that can be sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities 
the company s land and construction loans are primarily to finance the development construction of commercial and single family residential properties 
the company utilizes underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or availability of permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan 
the company makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles  various types of consumer goods  and other personal purposes 
consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest 
most of the company s consumer loans are secured by the personal property being purchased or  in the instances of home equity loans or lines  real property 

table of contents additionally  the company makes home equity lines of credit available to its existing customers 
home equity lines of credit are underwritten with a maximum loan to value ratio 
home equity lines are reviewed at least semiannually  with specific emphasis on loans with a loan to value ratio greater than and loans that were underwritten from mid through  when real estate values were at the peak in the cycle 
the company takes measures to work with customers to reduce line commitments and minimize potential losses 
there have been no adverse classifications to date as a result of the review 
with certain exceptions  state chartered banks are permitted to make extensions of credit to any one borrowing entity up to of the bank s capital and reserves for unsecured loans and up to of the bank s capital and reserves for secured loans 
for hbc  these lending limits were million and million at december   respectively 
loan maturities the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans 
loan maturities due in one year or less over one year but less than five years over five years total dollars in thousands commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer loans loans with variable interest rates loans with fixed interest rates loans nonperforming assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to credit quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and or downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
to help minimize credit quality concerns  we have established a sound approach to credit that includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
the policies and 
table of contents procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general california market and  particularly  primary local markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  and depressed real estate values 
nonperforming assets are comprised of the following loans for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on nonaccrual when they become days past due  unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection  and other real estate owned oreo from foreclosures 
management s classification of a loan as nonaccrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan 
at that point  the company stops accruing interest income  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income  and begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale 
total oreo was million at december   compared to  at december  the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans days past due and still accruing total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans plus other real estate owned primarily due to the general economic slowdown and a softening of the real estate market  nonperforming assets at december  increased million  or  from december  both the general economic slowdown and soft real estate markets are expected to continue into in some geographic sub markets and price points 
real estate assets within the revised federal mortgage guidelines have become available to refinance and investors are coming to the market to purchase commercial real estate assets  but at higher investor returns than have been in the market historically 

table of contents the following table provides nonperforming loans by loan type as of december  loan type nonaccrual over days past due and still accruing total dollars in thousands commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management s methodology for estimating the allowance balance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
specific allowances are established for impaired loans 
management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
loans for which the terms have been modified with a concession granted  and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties  are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral  less costs to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent or on the present value of expected future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market 
if the measure of the impaired loans is less than the investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation within the allowance will be established 
loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the formula portion of the allowance for loan losses analysis 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying estimated loss factors to pools of outstanding loans 
at december   loss factors were based on the company s historical loss experience  adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affected the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the adjustment factors for the formula allowance included existing general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  in particular the real estate market  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  the technology industry  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty 
in  the estimated loss factors for pools of loans that are not impaired are based on determining the probability of default and loss given default for loans within each segment of the portfolio  adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect collectibility as of the evaluation date 
the adjustment factors are similar to the factors considered under the previous methodology 
the company s historical delinquency experience and loss experience are utilized to determine the probability of default and loss given default for segments of the portfolio where the company has experienced losses in the past 

table of contents for segments of the portfolio where the company has no significant prior loss experience  the company uses quantifiable observable industry data to determine the probability of default and loss given default 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified loans include all loans considered as substandard  substandard nonaccrual  and doubtful and may result from problems specific to a borrower s business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower s ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate 
the principal balance of classified loans  net of sba guarantees  was million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
management of the level of classified loans will continue to be a focus for executive management  the lending staff and the company s special assets department 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis  we have engaged an outside firm to independently assess our methodology and perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the federal reserve and dfi also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process 
based on information currently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to further weaken 
also  any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty

the company s allowance for loan losses increased million in the significant increase in the provision for loan losses in was primarily due to a higher volume of classified and nonperforming loans and an increase in loan charge offs caused by challenging conditions in commercial lending and the residential housing market  turmoil in the financial markets  and the prolonged downturn in the overall economy 
the company had million in charge offs in  which were nominally offset by loan by recoveries of million 
net loans charged off reflects the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses 
net charge offs were million in  compared to net charge offs of million in  and to net recoveries of  in historical net loan charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future 

table of contents the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge offs that may occur within these categories 
allocation of loan loss allowance december  allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance percent of loans in each category to total loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer unallocated n a  n a  n a  n a  n a total in conjunction with the company s revised methodology in estimating losses on loans that are not impaired  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was reallocated to the respective loan categories in management believes that the revised methodology improves its ability to allocate probable credit loss to loan types 
prior to  management considered the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses necessary because of inherent subjective risk in the loan portfolio  however  the prior methodology did not distinguish this subjective allocation by loan type 
management considers this matter to be a reallocation in its allowance for loan losses calculation  and believes that there would be no significant change in the balance of the allowance for loan losses if this approach was used in all of the years presented above 
therefore  amounts prior to have not been reallocated 
goodwill goodwill resulted from the acquisition of diablo valley bank and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is assessed at least annually  as of november  for impairment with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined through a two step impairment test 
step includes the determination of the carrying value of the company s single reporting unit  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company is required to perform a second step to the impairment test 
the company completed its annual impairment analysis as of november  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the step valuation of the company was based on a weighted blend of the income approach and market approach 
the income approach estimates the fair value of the company based on the present value of discounted cash flows from future operations 
the market approach considers key pricing multiples of similar companies 
the step valuation indicated that the step analysis was necessary 
step requires that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill be compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair 
table of contents value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
after performing step  with the assistance of the same independent valuation firm  the company determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was greater than the carrying value  resulting in no impairment charge in deposits the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or  in other words  by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in california  and the company s market area in particular  continue to weaken 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances

the company s business is not generally seasonal in nature 
the company is not dependent upon funds from sources outside the united states 
at december  and  less than and of deposits were from public sources  respectively 
the decrease in deposits was primarily due to decreases in savings and money market deposits as a result of lower balances in title insurance company  escrow  and real estate exchange facilitators accounts and lower time deposits   and over

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december   as compared to million at december  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans at december  and  respectively 
the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted  because there is no certainty that the lines of credit will ever be fully utilized

liquidity and asset liability management liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service area and which have  historically  been a stable source of funds 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the company s interest margin 
in order to meet short term liquidity needs  the company utilizes overnight federal funds purchase arrangements and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks  solicits brokered deposits if cost effective deposits are not available from local sources and maintains collateralized lines of credit with the fhlb and frb 
in addition  the company can raise cash for temporary needs by selling securities under agreements to repurchase and selling securities available for sale 
during  the company experienced a tightening in its liquidity position as a result of significant loan growth and a decrease in real estate exchange facilitators deposit balances  which was partially funded by an increase in brokered deposits 
since december   the company had loan contraction of million  including loans held for sale  and it has experienced a modest improvement in its 
table of contents liquidity position 
one of the more important measures of liquidity is our loan to deposit ratio 
our loan to deposit ratio improved to at december  compared to at december  fhlb and frb borrowings and available lines of credit the company has off balance sheet liquidity in the form of federal funds purchase arrangements with correspondent banks  including the fhlb

the company repaid the line of credit in march  thus terminating the line of credit 
the company also utilizes securities sold under repurchase agreements to manage our liquidity position 
repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financial transactions and are secured by mortgage backed securities carried at an amortized cost of approximately million at december   and approximately million at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the following table summarizes the company s borrowings under its federal funds purchased  security repurchase arrangements and lines of credit for the periods indicated december  dollars in thousands average balance during the year average interest rate during the year maximum month end balance during the year average rate at december  capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million  including million in preferred stock  and million of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a regular basis and takes appropriate action to help ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
our tier capital consists of shareholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities  less goodwill and other intangible assets

market risk market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings  fair values  or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits and borrowings  as well as the company s role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and manage the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i a standard gap analysis  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  the net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest 
table of contents bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company uses modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down and ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  based on current trends and econometric models or stable economic conditions unchanged from current actual levels 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would increase in the event of a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would decrease in the event of a basis point decrease in applicable interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in applicable interest rates market value as a of present value of assets market value as a of present value of assets change in market value change in market value mv ratio change bp change in market value change in market value mv ratio change bp dollars in thousands change in rates bp bp bp bp bp management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying 
table of contents amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the mv methodology does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies general the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the realization of our deferred tax assets and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method  although the economics of our transactions would be the same 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed under the heading allowance for loan losses 
loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and i o strips are based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made on management s expectations of future prepayment and discount rates as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under the plan 
we also granted our chief executive officer restricted stock when he joined the company 

table of contents additionally  we have outstanding options that were granted under an option plan from which we no longer make grants 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of accounting guidance related to share based payments 
our results of operations for fiscal years   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
our accounting for stock options is disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
management utilizes various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses to determine these fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to the acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as changes in economic or market conditions  indicate that impairment may exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management 
if the fair value of the reporting unit including goodwill is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  a further test is required to measure the amount of impairment 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the goodwill is adjusted to a new cost basis 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the valuation of the company is based on a weighted blend of the income approach and market approach 
the income approach estimates the fair value of the company based on the present value of discounted cash flows from operations 
the market approach considers key pricing multiples of similar companies 
management believes the assumptions used in these calculations are consistent with current industry practice for valuing similar types of companies 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of november  and and the end of each quarter in with the assistance of a valuation firm 
intangible assets consist of core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from the acquisition of diablo valley bank in june these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment testing of these assets is performed at the individual asset level 
impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value at the date of the impairment test 
for intangible assets  estimates of expected future cash flows cash inflows less cash outflows that are directly associated with an intangible asset are used to determine the fair value of that asset 
management makes certain estimates and assumptions in determining the expected future cash flows from core deposit and customer relationship intangibles including account attrition  expected lives  discount rates  interest rates  servicing costs and other factors 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact the valuation of these intangible assets 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the intangible asset is adjusted to a new cost basis 
the new cost basis is then amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 

table of contents our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets is disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets our net deferred income tax asset arises from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the amounts used for income tax return purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise 
for financial reporting purposes  deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on both positive and negative evidence currently available 
evidence includes the historical levels of our taxable income  estimates of our future taxable income including tax planning strategies  the reversals of temporary differences  and potentially refundable taxes paid in carry back years 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income to obtain benefits from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we estimate that we have sufficient forecasted future taxable income  as well as various tax planning strategies which could be implemented to generate taxable income in future taxable periods  to support the balance of deferred tax assets 
based on these factors  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences and  therefore  no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was recorded at december   and our deferred tax accounting is disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company did not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosure or market risk called for by item of regulation s k is included as part of item of this report
