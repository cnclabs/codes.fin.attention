all references to years mean the relevant month period ended december overview general we are a technology based  specialty pharmaceutical company applying formulation and development expertise  as well as our drug delivery technology  to the development  manufacture and marketing of controlled release and niche generics  in addition to the development of branded products 
as of february   we marketed generic pharmaceuticals  which represent dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds through our own global pharmaceuticals division  another of our generic pharmaceuticals representing dosage variations of different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance agreement partners 
we have applications pending at the fda  including tentatively approved by the fda  and other products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed 
in the generic pharmaceuticals market  we focus our efforts on controlled release generic versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals covering a broad range of therapeutic areas and having technically challenging drug delivery mechanisms or limited competition 
we employ our technologies and formulation expertise to develop generic products that will reproduce the brand name product s physiological characteristics but not infringe any valid patents relating to the brand name product 
we generally focus on brand name products as to which the patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredient have expired or are near expiration  and we employ our proprietary formulation expertise to develop controlled release technologies that do not infringe patents covering the brand name products controlled release technologies 
we are also developing specialty generic pharmaceuticals we believe present one or more barriers to entry by competitors  such as difficulty in raw materials sourcing  complex formulation or development characteristics or special handling requirements 
in the brand name pharmaceuticals market  we are developing products for the treatment of central nervous system cns disorders 
our brand name product portfolio consists of development stage projects to which we are applying our formulation and development expertise to develop differentiated  modified  or controlled release versions of currently marketed either in the us or outside the us drug substances 
we intend to expand our brand name products portfolio primarily through internal development and also through licensing and acquisition 

table of contents we operate in two segments  referred to as the global pharmaceuticals division global division and the impax pharmaceuticals division impax division 
the global division develops  manufactures  sells  and distributes generic pharmaceutical products primarily through four sales channels the global products sales channel  for generic pharmaceutical prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers  large retail drug chains  and others  the private label sales channel  for generic pharmaceutical over the counter otc and prescription products we sell to unrelated third party customers who in turn sell the product to third parties under their own label  the rx partner sales channel  for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements  and the otc partner sales channel  for sales of generic pharmaceutical otc products sold through unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities under their own label pursuant to alliance agreements 
we also generate revenue from research and development services provided under a joint development agreement with another pharmaceutical company  and report such revenue under the caption research partner revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
we provide theses services through the research and development group in our global division 
the impax division is engaged in the development of proprietary brand pharmaceutical products through improvements to already approved pharmaceutical products to address cns disorders 
the impax division is also engaged in the co promotion of products developed by unrelated third party pharmaceutical entities through our direct sales force focused on marketing to physicians referred to as physician detailing sales calls in the cns community 
revenue recognition global product sales  net 
we recognize revenue from direct sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as revised by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue from direct product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss pass to customers 
provisions for estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded 
private label product sales 
we recognize revenue from direct sales in accordance with sab revenue from direct product sales is recognized at the time title and risk of loss pass to customers 
revenue received from private label product sales is not subject to deductions for chargebacks  rebates  returns  shelf stock adjustments  and other pricing adjustments 
additionally  private label product sales do not have upfront  milestone  or lump sum payments and do not contain multiple deliverables under fasb asc topic 
table of contents rx partner and otc partner 
each of our alliance agreements involves multiple deliverables in the form of products  services or licenses over extended periods 
fasb asc topic supplemented sab for accounting for such multiple deliverable arrangements 
with respect to our multiple deliverable arrangements  we determine whether any or all of the elements of the arrangement should be separated into individual units of accounting under fasb asc topic if separation into individual units of accounting is appropriate  we recognize revenue for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria specified by sab are achieved for the deliverable 
if separation is not appropriate  we recognize revenue and related direct manufacturing costs over the estimated life of the agreement utilizing a modified proportional performance method 
under this method the amount recognized in the period of initial recognition is based upon the number of years elapsed under the agreement relative to the estimated life of the particular agreement 
the amount of revenue recognized in the year of initial recognition is thus determined by multiplying the total amount realized by a fraction  the numerator of which is the then current year of the agreement and the denominator of which is the total number of estimated agreement years 
the balance of the amount realized is recognized in equal amounts in each of the remaining years 
thus  for example  with respect to profit share or royalty payment reported by a strategic partner during the third year of an agreement with an estimated life of years  of the amount reported is recognized in the year reported and of the amount is recognized during each of the remaining years 
a fuller description of our analysis under fasb asc topic and the modified proportional performance method is set forth in
