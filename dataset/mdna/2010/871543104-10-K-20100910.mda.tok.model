overview symmetricom  a world leader in precise time solutions  sets the world s standard for time 
we generate  distribute and apply precise time for the communications  aerospace defense  it infrastructure and metrology industries 
symmetricom s customers  from communications service providers and network equipment manufacturers to governments and their suppliers worldwide  are able to build more reliable networks and systems by using our advanced timing technologies  atomic clocks  services and solutions 
our products support today s precise timing standards  including gps based timing  ieee ptp  network time protocol ntp  synchronous ethernet  building integrated timing supply bits and data over cable service interface specifications docsis r timing 
our fiscal year is the or weeks ending on the sunday closest to june fiscal years through were week fiscal years 
fiscal year summary and outlook during fiscal  symmetricom made several key organizational changes and started a number of initiatives aimed at driving growth and creating a more efficient business model 
in terms of organizational changes  greg ruebusch was appointed executive vice president of global operations  juan dewar was appointed executive vice president of global sales and support and dan scharre was appointed executive vice president and general manager of our government business unit 
we also created the new role of executive vice president of marketing  appointing phil bourekas  to focus on strengthening our corporate branding and market development efforts and on the strategic goal of extending our value proposition into additional markets that depend on time and frequency 
in connection with our initiatives focused on building a more efficient organization  we made the decision to transition our puerto rico manufacturing operations to sanmina sci to improve our supply chain and cost model 
once fully implemented  this change will support the cost effective production of our key timing products and technologies  and free up additional dollars to accelerate current growth initiatives and invest in new ones 
we also improved our strategic positioning and cost structure with the sale of our quality of experience qoe product line  which enabled an enhanced focus on our core time and frequency business 
our key initiatives started in fiscal and aimed at driving growth include growing our international and services revenue 
in terms of international growth  we have added sales personnel in india and japan 
in terms of services growth  we are emphasizing our marketing and sales focus on our contract services business to maximize revenues and gross margins 
we continue to invest in the development and marketing of our new packetime product family and in expanding our line of embedded solutions 
expansion of our outsourcing arrangement with sanmina sci on april   we announced a restructuring plan to transfer product fabrication processes and related activities from our aguadilla  puerto rico facility to sanmina sci facilities 
as part of the plan  approximately 
table of contents positions will be eliminated or about of our total workforce 
we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately million in connection with the plan 
total restructuring charges are expected to include approximately million in one time termination benefits  approximately million in facility shutdown charges and approximately million in transfer and other restructuring related charges 
as part of this restructuring  we incurred million restructuring charges as of june  total cash expenditures associated with the restructuring plan are expected to be approximately million 
total non cash charges associated with the restructuring plan are expected to be approximately million  and mainly relate to additional depreciation charges for assets with shorter economic lives 
we plan to build approximately million in buffer inventory to support the transition 
upon completion  we expect the restructuring and other actions to reduce annual costs by approximately million 
sale of qoe during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our video qoe business to cheetah technologies  lp cheetah 
cheetah acquired the assets related to the qoe product line and hired the remaining qoe employees 
the total purchase price was million  including million held in escrow as of march  the escrowed funds are subject to forfeiture to satisfy indemnification and other obligations  if any  to cheetah 
the period of escrow for the million will expire on july  as a result of this transaction  we recognized a gain on sale of discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes  in fiscal this gain reflects million in cash received in the third quarter of fiscal  less transaction costs  the net carrying value of assets and liabilities transferred  and other related costs  resulting in a million gain on sales of discontinued operations  before income taxes 
during fiscal year  we also recognized a loss of million on the operating results of qoe during this period 
in addition  qoe will no longer be shown as a reportable segment within continuing operations and all comparative information from prior periods has been updated to reflect this change 
selected financial information related to discontinued operations follows year ended june  june  june  in thousands revenue loss on discontinued operations gain on sale of discontinued operations loss before income taxes income tax benefit loss on discontinued operations  net of tax segment reporting change in the third quarter of fiscal  we changed our segment reporting structure from four operating and reporting segments to two operating and reporting segments 
this change was affected to better reflect how the chief operating decision maker codm makes decisions about resource allocation and segment performance 
the codm  as defined by authoritative accounting guidance on segment reporting  is our president and chief executive officer ceo 
our ceo allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income loss before interest and taxes 
operating income loss before income interest and taxes by operating segment excludes certain corporate related costs including selling  general and administrative costs not directly identifiable to the two operating costs as well as our restructuring costs 
symmetricom is now organized into two operating segments corresponding to our two divisions communications and government 
for each of these segments  we have separate financial 
table of contents information  including operating income loss amounts  which are evaluated regularly by our ceo 
the comparative information from prior periods related to segments in the following section  results of operations  has been updated to reflect this change 
convertible notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we agreed to purchase approximately million aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible subordinated notes notes in privately negotiated transactions  for a purchase price of million  representing the par value principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
this repurchase represented the repayment of all outstanding convertible notes prior to june  the purchased notes will be retired and cancelled by the company 
as a result of the full redemption of the notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax loss of million  which represents the difference between the carrying value of the liability component of the redeemed amount and its fair value at the date of redemption in the fourth quarter of fiscal effective june   we adopted new authoritative guidance on accounting for our notes 
this guidance applies to certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets  or partially in cash  upon conversion and is required to be applied retrospectively 
the adoption impacted the accounting for the notes by requiring the initial proceeds to be allocated between a liability and an equity component based on the fair value of the liability component as of the issuance date 
we determined that the initial liability component of the notes was valued at million  with the equity component representing the residual amount of the notes proceeds 
as a result  for fiscal  we retrospectively recorded million as a component of equity and a corresponding debt discount as of the date of issuance  and a deferred tax liability of million 
in addition  we allocated million  net of tax  of the total issuance costs of million to the equity component of the notes and the remaining million of the issuance costs remained classified as long term other assets 
the issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the relative carrying amounts of the liability and equity components 
the debt discount and the issuance costs allocated to the liability component are amortized using the effective interest method as additional interest expense over a seven year period ending june at which point the notes may be redeemed by the holders or by us 
the equity component of the issuance costs of million is included in common stock as additional paid in capital 
as a result of the partial redemption of the notes in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax loss on partial redemption of million  which represents the difference between the carrying value of the liability component of the redeemed amount and its fair value at the date of redemption in the first quarter of fiscal upon adoption  interest expense increased on our notes by adding a non cash component to amortize a debt discount calculated based on the difference between the cash coupon rate per year of the notes and the effective interest rate on the debt borrowing per year 
for the year ended june   the total interest expense relating to our notes was million  including million related to the contractual interest coupon and million related to amortization of the discount on the liability component 
for the year ended june   the total interest expense relating to our notes was million  including million related to the contractual interest coupon and million related to amortization of the discount on the liability component 
known trends and uncertainties impacting future results of operations global market and economic conditions in the second half of calendar year  the financial markets in the us and abroad experienced a severe downturn arising from a multitude of factors  including concerns about the systemic impact of large financial 
table of contents institutions experiencing acute credit crises  geopolitical issues  broad adverse credit conditions  higher energy costs  lower corporate profits and capital spending  and declining real estate and mortgage markets  combined with volatile oil prices  decreased business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment 
while some of these conditions have abated in recent months  general concerns about the stability of the markets and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases cease  to provide funding to borrowers 
while there has been some improvement in general macro economic conditions since late calendar year and  the current macro economic factors remain dynamic and uncertain and are likely to remain so into calendar if difficult economic conditions or the constrained credit environment markedly continue  our customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  additional excess and obsolete inventory  potential impairment charges related to our intangible assets  gross margin deterioration  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and supplier difficulties 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies due to their subjective nature and judgments involved in each revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
however  for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of the invoice is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
generally  product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is incidental to product functionality 
for instances where embedded software is more than incidental to product functionality  we account for the transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense both when orders are received and shipped  at which times the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of 
table of contents completion method cost to cost basis  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as a performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
warranty our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
the revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of contract 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
accounting for income taxes we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period that includes the enactment date 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which are made up of tax deductions  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a portion of our tax credits are related to stock options and have a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and 
table of contents measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
short term investments short term investments consist of government securities  mutual funds and corporate debt securities that mature between three and months 
all of our short term investments  except the deferred compensation plan assets  are classified as available for sale 
during fiscal  we reclassified the deferred compensation plan assets from available for sale to trading securities in order to maintain consistency with the method in which we account for the deferred compensation obligation 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with temporary unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity 
unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are included in interest income in our consolidated statements of operations 
short term investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we consult with our investment manager and consider available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments on a quarterly basis 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to operations and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
during fiscal years and  we recorded losses related to short term investments of million and million  respectively 
there were no losses related to short term investments recorded in fiscal business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  and the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
valuation of goodwill during the third quarter of fiscal  due to a decline in our stock price and a lowered business outlook  we determined that indicators of a potential goodwill impairment existed 
accordingly  we completed a step one goodwill impairment test to determine whether the decline in market capitalization and business outlook revisions indicated that the carrying value of our reporting units were in excess of fair value 
a step one goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if a step two test is required 
we estimate our reporting unit s fair values using a weighted average of 
table of contents values determined under an income approach and a market approach 
we weighed these approaches at approximately and for the income approach and the market approach  respectively 
we applied a lower weighting to the market approach as there are a limited number of highly comparable companies  which are a key component of the market approach 
under the income approach  fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on several significant assumptions  including our earnings projections and our cost of capital 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on pricing multiples of certain financial parameters observed in comparable companies 
based on the results of our step one test  we determined that the fair values of the communications and government reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts  and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss for the each reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal  consisting of million related to the communications reporting segment and million related to the government reporting segment 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include purchased technology and trademarks 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge were recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the life of the asset 
in the third quarter of fiscal  because of the identification of goodwill impairment indicators see above valuation of goodwill  we first reviewed our other intangible and long lived assets for impairment and determined there was no impairment

table of contents key operating metrics key operating metrics for measuring our performance include sales backlog and contract revenue 
these metrics  which compare fiscal year with fiscal year  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of june   compared to million as of june  the million reduction in backlog between june  and june  was primarily due to an improvement in product lead times  resulting in more product that is booked and shipped within the same quarter 
our backlog  which is shippable within the next six months  was million as of june   compared to million as of june  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period may be categorized into two types firm fixed price and cost plus reimbursement 
revenue is recognized under the fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  cost to cost basis principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs at completion on the individual contracts 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue recognized under cost plus contracts is recognized on the basis of direct and indirect costs incurred plus a negotiated profit calculated as a percentage of costs or as performance based award fee 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
as of june   we had approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of june  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million  compared to million as of june  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of june  were million  a decrease of million from million as of june  this decrease was primarily the result of the repayment of million of our notes offset by the million of cash and cash equivalents generated by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities was driven by the net income of million  in addition to non cash charges of million including million of loss on repurchase of convertible notes  million of depreciation and amortization expenses  million of stock based compensation expense  million of non cash interest on our notes  million of provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  million for other non cash adjustments  offset by million of deferred income taxes and million for gain on sale of discontinued operations 
requirements for working capital assets and liabilities drove cash provided in operations of approximately million  comprised of a million increase in other accrued liabilities  million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in prepaids and other assets  and a million decrease in inventory  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and a million decrease in accrued compensation 
the million net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was attributable to million in purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of capital equipment  partially offset by million in maturities of short term investments and million of cash proceeds from sale of 
table of contents discontinued operations 
the million net cash used for financing activities was attributable to million used to repay our notes in full  and million used to repurchase common stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from issuance of common stock 
our total capital spending commitments outstanding as of june  were approximately million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of june   compared to days as of june  we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
convertible subordinated notes on june   we sold million of contingent convertible subordinated notes the notes  which were to mature on june  and paid interest at the rate of per annum 
interest on the notes was payable semi annually in june and december of each year beginning on december  the notes are unsecured obligations and were subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt 
the notes were structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes were convertible  at the holder s option  prior to the maturity date into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock in the following circumstances prior to june   if the common stock price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs was more than of the conversion price of the notes in effect on that th trading day  on or after june   at all times on or after any date on which the common stock price was more than of the then current conversion price  during the five consecutive business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes for each such trading day was less than of the average of the sale price of our common stock during such five trading day period multiplied by the then current conversion rate  if we had called the particular notes for redemption and the redemption had not yet occurred  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
holders could convert any outstanding notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price per share of  which was determined based on the reported closing price of our common stock of per share on june  also  on or after june   we could redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of redemption  payable in cash

table of contents us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on june   and or at any date in the event of certain change of control events related to us for a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of repurchase  payable in cash 
convertible subordinated notes redemption fiscal on may   we received a notice of acceleration from the trustee under the indenture governing the notes 
the notice stated that our failure to file our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended december  violated certain provisions of the indenture 
the acceleration letter declared that the principal amount outstanding under the notes  together with any accrued and unpaid interest  and fees and expenses  was immediately due and payable 
this notice of acceleration related to the trustee s and certain bondholders previous notice received by the company on or about march  stating that our failure to file our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended december  with the securities and exchange commission sec violated provisions of the indenture 
on june   we filed our form q for the quarter ended december  and our form q for the quarter ended march   as well as other filings related to our restatement of financial results for fiscal years and interim periods from june  to july  and for the first quarter of fiscal ended september  on june   we offered to purchase for cash  on a pro rata basis  million aggregate principal amount of the notes  at a purchase price equal to per  of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the tender offer cap was equal to of the million aggregate principal amount outstanding 
as of july   pursuant to the offer  symmetricom accepted for payment million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the aggregate purchase price for the notes surrendered was approximately million  which included interest of million 
after the purchase pursuant to the offer  approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding 
in connection with the completion of the tender offer  the holder of a majority of the outstanding notes prior to the offer waived certain defaults alleged to have occurred under the indenture and rescinded the acceleration notice received by symmetricom on may  as a result of the partial redemption of the notes in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax loss of million  which represents the difference between the carrying value of the liability component of the redeemed amount and its fair value at the date of redemption in the first quarter of fiscal convertible subordinated notes redemption fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we agreed to purchase all outstanding million aggregate principal amount of our notes in privately negotiated transactions  for a purchase price of million  representing the par value principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the purchased notes were retired and cancelled 
as a result of the full redemption of the notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a pre tax loss of million  which represents the difference between the carrying value of the liability component of the redeemed amount and its fair value at the date of redemption in the fourth quarter of fiscal contractual obligations we operate in multiple locations domestically and internationally 
as such  certain facilities and equipment are leased under operating lease agreements 
due to excess capacity on several non cancelable leases as a result of the economic downturn  we subleased certain facilities and recognized lease loss liabilities for the remainder 

table of contents we incur purchase commitments during our normal course of business 
as of june   our principal commitments totaled million and related primarily to commitments to purchase inventory 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases obligations purchase obligations post retirement benefits liabilities lease loss accrual total 
operating lease obligation is net of the lease loss accrual relates to a post retirement health care benefits plan  assumed during an acquisition in fiscal the plan was curtailed in fiscal  and only existing retired participants and employees of the acquired company  now employed by symmetricom and meeting the retirement eligibility requirements by december   are eligible for participation 
the health care plan is a contributory plan 
uncertain tax positions of million consist of amounts included in the net deferred tax asset balance of million at june  which would affect our income tax expense if recognized 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the year in which the future cash flows may occur and therefore have not included them in the above table 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant non observable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance became effective for us in the quarter ended march  the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning june  under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
under this guidance  we will be required to determine the relative selling price for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement based on the hierarchy identified in the new standard 
we are currently evaluating the impact this new guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance codifying a single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap 
this guidance does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
all existing accounting standard documents will be superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the fasb codification will be considered non authoritative 
these provisions are effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  and  accordingly  are currently effective for us 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements  but has impacted our financial reporting process by eliminating all references to pre codification standards 
on the effective date  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards  and all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
these investments are mainly in government sponsored enterprise and corporate debt securities that have maturity dates of greater than three months 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk in as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
the possibility exists that some of these issues may be downgraded as a result of disruptions in the credit market  however  we believe that we currently have the ability and currently intend to hold these investments until maturity  or until they recover their value at par or face value  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business in various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
