critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that are not entitled to price concessions and rights of return  is generally recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer which typically occurs upon shipment 
all shipping costs are charged to cost of product revenue 
revenue from products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for stock rotations are generally recognized upon shipment 
reserves for stock rotations are estimated based primarily on historical experience and provided for at the time of shipment 
for products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and stock rotation rights product returns  we recognize revenue based on when the distributor reports that it has sold the product to its customer 
our recognition of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from the distributor which establishes a customer  quantity and final price 
revenue is not recognized upon our shipment of product to the distributor  since  due to certain forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at the time of shipment 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to its customer 
additionally  these distributors have stock rotation rights permitting them to return products to us  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
when the distributor reports that it has sold product to its customer  our sales price to the distributor is fixed 
once we receive the point of sales reports from a distributor  it has satisfied all the requirements for revenue recognition with respect to the product reported as sold and any product returns stock rotation and price concession rights that the distributor has under its distributor agreement with silicon image lapsed at that time 
pursuant to our distributor agreements  older  end of life and certain other products are generally sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
for these products  revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and  until revenue is recognized  record the gross margin in deferred margin on sale to distributors  a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred margin on the sale to distributor effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor 
however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sales to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions 
we sell each item in our product price book to all of our distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer  product  quantity  geography  competitive pricing and other factors 
the majority of our distributors resale is priced at a discount from list price 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed 
thus  a portion of the deferred margin on the sale to distributor balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future 
the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred margin on the sale to distributors line item that will be remitted back to the distributors 
in addition to the above  we also reduce the deferred margin by anticipated or determinable future price protections based on revised price lists  if any 
we derive revenue from license of its internally developed intellectual property ip 
we enter into ip licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
revenue earned under contracts with our licensees is classified as licensing revenue 
our license fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and for multiple deliverable arrangements  we follow the guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification no 
 multiple element arrangements recognition  previously discussed in emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method  if objective and reliable evidence of fair value does not exist for delivered elements 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the revenue criteria mentioned above 
the ip licensing agreements generally include a nonexclusive license for the underlying ip 
fees under these agreements generally include a license fees relating to our ip  b support  typically for one year  and c royalties payable following the sale by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
the license of our ip has standalone value and can be used by the licensee without support 
further  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for support 
accordingly  license and support fees are each treated as separate units of accounting 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
for contracts related to licenses of our technology that involve significant modification  customization or engineering services  we recognize revenue in accordance the provisions of fasb asc no 
 construction type and production type contracts recognition  previously discussed in statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues derived from such license contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we determine progress to completion based on input measures using labor hours incurred by our engineers 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total contract fees and the percentage of completion achieved 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
if there is significant uncertainty about customer acceptance  or the time to complete the development or the deliverables by either party  we apply the completed contract method 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenue 
financial instruments we account for our investments in debt securities under fasb asc no 
 investments in debt and equity securities recognition  previously discussed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date 
the investments are adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity and such amortization is included in interest income 
we adopted the guidance provided by fasb asc no 
 transition related to recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  previously referred to as fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments effective april  and use the guidance therein to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
other than temporary impairment charges exists when the entity has the intent to sell the security  it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery or it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
other than temporary impairments are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
the longer the duration of our investment securities  the more susceptible they are to changes in market interest rates and bond yields 
as yields increase  those securities purchased with a lower yield at cost show a mark to market unrealized loss 
historically  unrealized losses have been due to changes in interest rates and bond yields 
due to the high credit quality of such investments  we expect to realize the full value of all these investments upon maturity or sale 
the classification of our investments into cash equivalents and short term investments is in accordance with fasb asc no 
 cash and cash equivalents glossary  previously discussed in sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
cash equivalents consist of short term  highly liquid financial instruments with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
short term investments consist of taxable commercial paper  united states government agency obligations  corporate municipal notes and bonds with high credit quality and money market preferred stock 
these securities have maturities greater than three months from the date of purchase 
we believe all of the financial instruments recorded values approximate current fair values because of their nature and respective durations 
the fair value of marketable securities is determined using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial instruments 
derivative instruments we recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with fasb asc no 
 derivatives and hedging recognition  previously discussed in sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative gain loss is reported in each reporting period in other income expense on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectability of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer and the reason for the delinquency 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost  adjusted for variances between standard and actual 
standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs  manufacturing yields  costs to assemble  test and package our products and allocable indirect costs 
we record differences between standard costs and actual costs as variances 
these variances are analyzed and are either included on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statement of operations in order to state the inventories at actual costs on a fifo basis 
standard costs are evaluated at least annually 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero unless specific facts and circumstances warrant no write down or a write down to a different value and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
once a provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for a business acquisition and the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we periodically review the carrying value of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether impairment may exist 
fasb asc no 
 subsequent measurement of goodwill  and fasb asc no 
 subsequent measurement of general intangibles other than goodwill asc  whose provisions were previously discussed in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  require that goodwill be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have determined based on the criteria of fasb asc no 
 segment reporting disclosure  previously discussed in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  that we have one reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of the reporting unit using generally accepted valuation methodology which considers market capitalization and market premiums 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets  for example the ip we acquired from sunplus refer to note below  we are required to estimate the useful life of its asset and recognize the cost as an expense over the estimated useful life 
we use the straight line method to depreciate long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc no 
 subsequent measurement of property  plant and equipment  paragraphs  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  previously discussed in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying amount of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
in the event that the carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge to our statement of operations equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s fair value 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult and requires the use of significant judgment 
we amortize purchased intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
significant assumptions are inherent and highly subjective in this process 
we assign the following useful lives to its fixed assets three years for computers and software  one to five years for equipment and five to seven years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life  which ranges from two to five years 
depreciation expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the fasb asc no 
asc  previously discussed in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the subsequent period when such a change in estimate occurs 
we use an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
in general  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realization of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for valuation allowances 
in accordance with asc  we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions under asc were previously discussed in fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred  the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
guarantees  indemnifications and warranty liabilities certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to the intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
at the time of revenue recognition  we provide an accrual for estimated costs included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to be incurred pursuant to our warranty obligation 
our estimate is based primarily on historical experience 
restructuring expenses we record provisions for workforce reduction costs and exit costs when they are probable and estimable 
severance paid under ongoing benefit arrangements is recorded in accordance with fasb asc no 
 nonretirement postemployment benefits recognition  previously discussed in sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
one time termination benefits and contract settlement and lease costs are recorded in accordance with fasb asc no 
 exit or disposal cost obligations recognition  previously discussed in sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
at each reporting date  we evaluate our accruals related to workforce reduction charges  contract settlement and lease costs and plant and equipment write downs to ensure that these accruals are still appropriate 
restructuring expense accruals related to future lease commitments on exited facilities included estimates  primarily related to sublease income over the lease terms and other costs for vacated properties 
increases or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified as restructuring expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
adjustments to workforce reduction accruals may be required when employees previously identified for separation do not receive severance payments because they are no longer employed by us or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plan was initiated 
in these cases  we reverse any related accrual to earnings when it is determined it is no longer required 
alternatively  in certain circumstances  we may determine that certain accruals are insufficient as new events occur or as additional information is obtained 
in these cases  we would increase the applicable existing accrual with the offset recorded against earnings 
increases or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified as restructuring expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oems rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of our revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and microtek comprised  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
weikeng industrial generated and of our revenue in and  respectively 
revenue from world peace inc comprised and of our revenue in and  respectively 
innotech corporation comprised and of our revenue in and  respectively 
we have been named as defendants in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings incidental to its business and may be named again from time to time  and although adverse decisions or settlements may occur in one or more of such cases  the final resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are incorporated into flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
primarily all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard codification asc no 
 generally accepted accounting principles gaap asc or fasb codification  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no sfas 
the effective date for use of the fasb codification is for interim and annual periods ending after september  companies should account for the adoption of the guidance on a prospective basis 
effective july   the company adopted the fasb codification and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the company has appropriately updated its disclosures with the appropriate fasb codification references for the year ended december  as such  all the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis section have been updated with the appropriate fasb codification references 
in december  the fasb issued asc no 
 business combinations asc  previously referred to as sfas revised  business combinations 
asc will significantly change current practices regarding business combinations 
among the more significant changes  asc expands the definition of a business and a business combination  requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests including goodwill  measured at fair value at the acquisition date  requires acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination  and requires in process research and development to be capitalized at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the provisions of asc on january  and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  if the company enters into material business combinations in the future  a transaction may significantly impact the company s consolidated financial statements as compared to the company s previous acquisitions accounted for under prior gaap requirements  due to the changes described above

asc amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments in the financial statements 
the most significant change asc brings is a revision to the amount of other than temporary loss of a debt security recorded in earnings 
asc is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the company adopted this fsp effective april  and the company s adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures subsequent measurement asc  which discusses the provisions related to the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased  which was previously discussed in fsp sfas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
asc provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
asc also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
asc emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique s used  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 transition related to fasb statement no 
 the above provisions are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and is applied prospectively 
the company adopted the provisions relating to determining the fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly under asc effective april  and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc no 
 business combinations subsequent measurement asc  which discusses the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  which was previously discussed in fsp fas r  accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies 
asc addresses application issues on initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
the provisions under asc relating to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted the provisions of asc on january  and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  if the company enters into material business combinations in the future  a transaction may significantly impact the company s consolidated financial statements as compared to the company s previous acquisitions  accounted for under prior gaap requirements  due to the changes described above

 subsequent events asc  previously referred to as sfas no 
 subsequent events 
asc should be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events 
this statement does not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable gaap that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions 
asc would apply to both interim financial statements and annual financial statements 
the objective of asc is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and  the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
asc is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  the company adopted this standard effective april  and the company s adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
on topic  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
the objective of this update is to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
vendors often provide multiple products or services to their customers 
those deliverables often are provided at different points in time or over different time periods 
this update provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments in this update establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments in this update also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting update on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  fasb issued accounting standard update no 
on topic  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  previously included in american iinstitute of certified public accountants sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
topic focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software revenue guidance and which are not 
this topic removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance if the products contain both software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting update on its consolidated financial statements 
annual results of operations revenue by product line was as follows change change dollars in thousands consumer electronics personal computer storage total product revenue percentage of total revenue licensing revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue revenue including development  licensing and royalty revenues collectively  licensing revenue  by product line change change dollars in thousands consumer electronics personal computer storage products total revenue total revenue for was million and represented a decline of from levels 
revenue from all our product lines in decreased when compared to revenues generated in revenues in from consumer electronics ce  personal computers pc  storage and licensing decreased by   and  respectively  when compared to the revenues generated in these product lines in revenues from our product lines decreased by million or from million in to million in product shipments in decreased by approximately and average selling price declined by approximately when compared to the shipments and average selling prices in  primarily due to the ongoing global recession  increased competition  product mix changes in the dtv market and our ongoing product transition as customers transition from hdmi receivers to more cost effective port processors 
another factor that caused the unit shipments to decrease from fiscal year to was the hdmi and sata integration into pc chip sets 
we also experienced significant declines in our licensing revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the licensing revenues generated in our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology 
most of the intellectual property we license includes a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building products that directly compete with ours in those market segments we have chosen to pursue 
revenue from licensing accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in licensing revenues in as compared to was due primarily to the overall softening of demand for consumer products as a result of the deterioration of the global economic climate 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect our revenues to decrease sequentially 
from time to time  we enter into direct agreements for certain of our products for certain identified end customers with our distributors who previously had the rights for price concessions and product returns 
the direct agreements convert the previously existing distributor relationship for these products and identified customers into a direct customer whereby the distributor does not have price protection or return rights 
revenue for such sales is recorded at the time of shipment 
for the years ended december   december  and december   we recorded million  million and million in revenue under such direct arrangements  respectively 
also during the year  as part of our strategic realignment of our distributor relationships  we entered into sell in agreements with some of our distributors for certain products for identified end customers 
these sell in agreements do not provide for price protection  but allow limited stock rotation rights 
additionally  at the time of entering into the sell in agreements  the distributors are allowed to convert products which had been previously shipped under the distributor agreement into products under the sell in agreements 
as a result of such conversion  the distributors sacrifice the right of price protection  therefore resulting in the price for such products becoming fixed 
products sold to the distributors under the sell in agreements are recorded as revenue upon shipment or  in the case of a conversion to sell in  upon conversion with an appropriate reserve for expected stock rotation returns recorded at the time of shipment or at the time of conversion for conversions to sell in 
the primary reason for the strategic realignment of our distributor relationships towards a direct revenue model and away from the distributor model was to leverage the benefits of the direct model  such as better risk management and increased operational and transactional processing efficiencies

long term liquidity based on our estimated cash flows  we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to continue to invest in property and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
our future operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we generate product revenue and related margins  the extent to which we generate cash through stock option exercises and proceeds from sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  the timing and extent of licensing revenue  investments in inventory  property  plant and equipment and accounts receivable  the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our operating expenses  including legal and patent assertion costs and general economic conditions 
in addition  cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any 
while  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances together with income derived from sales of our products and licensing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future  to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available when we need them  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions since mid  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
the following represents the potential change to the value of our investments given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the following represents the potential change to the value of our fixed income securities given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and short term investments and accounts receivable 
a majority of our cash and investments are maintained with a major financial institutions headquartered in the united states 
as part of our cash and investment management processes  we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from investments held at these financial institutions 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our investment securities consist of various major corporations and financial institutions of high credit standing 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and may require collateral  such as letters of credit  to secure accounts receivable if deemed necessary 
we maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of collectability 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  the south korean won  taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices or vice versa  for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results 
cash balances held in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
the following represents the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the foreign currencies which we use in our operations 
as of december  and  cash held in foreign countries was approximately million and million  respectively 
the following represents the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro  british pound  japanese yen  chinese yuan  taiwan dollar and korean won for the years ended december  and this sensitivity analysis aggregates our annual activity in these currencies  translated to us dollars  and applies a change in the us dollar value of  and
