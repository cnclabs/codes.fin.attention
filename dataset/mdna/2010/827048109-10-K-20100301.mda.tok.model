item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food  metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products  and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit volume market share for the year ended december  of approximately half of the market in the united states  a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum closures for food and beverage products and a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for a variety of markets  including the personal care  health care  household and industrial chemical and food markets 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business  reduce operating costs  build sustainable competitive positions  or franchises  and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth  and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market 
sales growth we have increased net sales and market share in our metal food container  closures and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past twenty years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestl  dial  del monte  birds eye  campbell and pacific coast reflect this trend 
we estimate that approximately percent of the market for metal food containers is still served by self manufacturers 
the metal food container market in north america was relatively flat during this period  despite losing market share as a result of more dining out  fresh produce and competing materials 
however  we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the united states primarily through acquisitions  and we have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value added features such as our quick top easy open ends  shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers 
we anticipate that the market will be relatively flat in the future  but will continue to increase in areas of consumer convenience products such as single serve sizes and easy open ends 
in  percent of our metal food containers sold had a quick top easy open end 
with our acquisitions of our closure operations in north america  europe  asia and south america  we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal  composite and plastic vacuum 
table of contents closures for food and beverage products  with leadership positions in the north american and european markets 
we may pursue further consolidation in these markets 
in particular  the closures segment of the consumer goods packaging industry in europe is highly fragmented  and we intend to pursue further consolidation opportunities in this market 
additionally  we expect to continue to generate internal growth in our closures business  particularly in plastic vacuum closures 
we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with net sales increasing more than sixfold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials 
we have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care 
we intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value added operating expertise and strategy 
operating performance we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
we have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
our acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling 
from  we have closed three metal food container manufacturing facilities  one closures manufacturing facility and two plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations  reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand 
in furtherance of such efforts  in we announced plans to close our port clinton  ohio plastic container manufacturing facility and to consolidate that facility s operations into other production sites 
we have also invested substantial capital in the past few years for new market opportunities and value added products such as new quick top easy open ends for metal food containers  shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to invest in new market opportunities  maintain our market position  improve our productivity and reduce our manufacturing costs 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers such as our metal food container supply agreements with our two largest customers  nestl through for approximately percent of our sales to nestl and through for our remaining sales to nestl and campbell through 
we estimate that in approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales  a majority of our projected closures sales in the united states and a majority of our projected plastic container sales will be under multi year arrangements 
many of our multi year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
in recent years  the steel industry in the united states announced significant price increases for steel 
under our supply arrangements  we were able to increase prices to pass through higher steel costs 
for our non contract customers  we also increased prices to pass through higher steel costs 
resin prices have also fluctuated significantly in the past few years  and we have been able to pass through changes in resin costs in accordance with our supply arrangements 
our metal food container business sales and income from operations are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
our closures business 
table of contents is also dependent  in part  upon vegetable and fruit harvests 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
additionally  as is common in the packaging industry  we provide extended payment terms to some of our customers in our metal food container business due to the seasonality of the vegetable and fruit packing process 
use of capital historically  we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our long term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using reasonable leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in determining reasonable leverage  we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions 
if acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time  we may use our cash flow to repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted uses 
since  we have maintained a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents to ensure our access to liquidity 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness  or percent of our total outstanding indebtedness  which bore interest at floating rates 
you should read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements 
in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  and  our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt as a percentage of our income from operations was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
change in accounting method in the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of valuing the inventory of our us plastic container business from the lifo method to the fifo method 
we believe the fifo method of inventory valuation is preferable for our plastic container business because fifo provides a better matching of revenues to expenses due to a lag in the pass through of changes in resin costs to customers and enhances the comparability of results to our peers 
as a result of this change  all prior year amounts have been retrospectively adjusted as of the beginning of the earliest period presented

year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent decrease as compared to primarily as a result of lower average selling prices in the plastic container business largely attributable to the pass through of lower resin prices  lower volumes in the closures and plastic container businesses and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation  partially offset by higher average selling prices in the metal food container business due to the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs 
income from operations in increased million  or percent  as compared to due primarily to improved manufacturing efficiencies and ongoing cost controls across all businesses and lower rationalization charges  partially offset by increased pension expense and the impact from lower unit volumes in the closures and plastic container businesses 
our results for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
net income in increased million to million as compared to net sales 
the million decrease in consolidated net sales in as compared to was the result of lower net sales in our closures and plastic container businesses  partially offset by higher net sales in our metal food container business 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs 
unit volume was essentially flat year over year  as volume increases from a favorable fruit and vegetable pack in the third quarter of were offset by the effect of a buy ahead in the fourth quarter of as a result of certain customers buying in advance of raw material price increases 
net sales for the closures business decreased million  or percent  as compared to this decrease was primarily the result of lower unit volumes attributable to demand softness in the single serve beverage markets and a buy ahead in the fourth quarter of due to raw material price increases and unfavorable foreign currency translation of million  partially offset by higher pricing for metal closures due to the pass through of higher raw material costs 
net sales for the plastic container business in decreased million  or percent  as compared to this decrease was principally attributable to the impact of lower average selling prices as a result of the pass through of lower raw material costs  a decline in unit volumes due to general weakness in demand and unfavorable foreign currency translation of million 
gross profit 
gross profit margin increased to percent in as compared to percent in for the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased to percent in from percent in income from operations 
income from operations for increased by million as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 

table of contents income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were primarily the result of improved manufacturing efficiencies due in part to the significant fruit and vegetable pack volume in the third quarter of  ongoing improvements in cost controls and a decrease in rationalization charges of million  partially offset by higher pension and depreciation expense 
income from operations of the closures business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these increases were primarily attributable to the benefits of ongoing cost reduction initiatives  improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower rationalization charges  partially offset by lower unit volumes 
rationalization charges were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
income from operations of the plastic container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these decreases were primarily attributable to lower unit volumes and higher pension expense  partially offset by ongoing cost reductions 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for decreased million to million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower average debt balances outstanding in as compared to  partially offset by slightly higher interest rates largely as a result of the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of the notes in may during  we utilized the net proceeds from this issuance and cash on hand to prepay certain term loan installment payments under the credit agreement and foreign debt 
as a result of these prepayments  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview 
consolidated net sales were billion in  representing a percent increase as compared to principally due to higher average selling prices across all businesses primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs  favorable foreign currency translation and increased volumes in the metal food container and closure businesses  partially offset by a decline in volumes in the plastic container business 
income from operations in decreased million  or percent  as compared to due primarily to inflation in manufacturing and other costs  a million increase in rationalization charges and a decrease in unit volumes in the plastic container business  partially offset by the benefits of ongoing cost control and manufacturing efficiencies 
our results for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
net income in decreased million to million as compared to net sales 
the million increase in consolidated net sales in as compared to was the result of higher net sales across all businesses 
net sales for the metal food container business increased million  or percent  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs as well as higher unit volumes partially due to a buy ahead by certain customers in the fourth quarter of in advance of raw material price increases 

table of contents net sales for the closures business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was primarily the result of higher unit volumes which included sales from operations acquired in in brazil  spain and china  favorable foreign currency translation of million and higher average selling prices due to the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by the impact from weaker demand for single serve beverage products later in net sales for the plastic container business in increased million  or percent  as compared to this increase was principally attributable to higher average selling prices as a result of the pass through of higher raw material costs  partially offset by lower unit volumes due to general market declines 
gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to percent in as compared to percent in for the reasons discussed below in income from operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales remained unchanged at percent in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million as compared to due primarily to the impact of foreign currency and the inclusion of the closures operations acquired in income from operations 
income from operations for decreased by million as compared to and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations for and included rationalization charges of million and million  respectively 
income from operations of the metal food container business for increased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin increased to percent from percent over the same periods despite the mathematical consequence of passing through significant manufacturing cost inflation to our customers in the form of price increases during the year 
the increases in income from operations and operating margin were the result of benefits derived from continued cost control and manufacturing efficiencies  a million reduction in rationalization charges in as compared to and higher unit volumes  partially offset by the negative effects of a substantial reduction in inventories during the fourth quarter of and the impact of higher depreciation expense 
income from operations of the closures business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
these decreases were attributable to rationalization charges of million in related to the shut down of the manufacturing facility in turkey and the consolidation of various administrative positions in europe as well as significant inflation in manufacturing and other costs 
these decreases were partially offset by rationalization benefits  ongoing cost controls  improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher unit volumes 
income from operations of the plastic container business for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and operating margin decreased to percent from percent over the same periods 
income from operations and operating margin decreased primarily as a result of inflation in manufacturing and other costs  a decrease in unit volumes and the negative impact from the lag in passing through resin price increases to customers 
these decreases were partially offset by ongoing cost controls  rationalization benefits and improved manufacturing performance 
interest and other debt expense 
interest and other debt expense for decreased million to million as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower market interest rates and higher interest income attributable to more cash and cash equivalents held during  partially offset by the effects of higher average borrowings as we maintained higher revolving loan borrowings to ensure access to liquidity in light of general credit market issues 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was percent as compared to percent in the effective tax rate benefited from tax credits relating to certain non recurring state tax incentives and research and development credits  partially offset by a valuation allowance established to offset deferred tax benefits related to net operating losses in turkey as a result of our decision to close the manufacturing facility in turkey 
capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments  including our credit agreement 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the issue price for the notes was percent of their principal amount 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in cash on august and february of each year and the notes mature on august  net proceeds from the issuance of the notes of million were used to prepay all of the term loan installment payments and substantially all of the term loan installment payments due under the credit agreement 
in  we used cash from operations of million  increases in outstanding checks of million  proceeds from the issuance of the notes of million and net proceeds from stock based compensation issuances of million to fund net payments of foreign revolving loans of million  repayment of term loans of million  net capital expenditures of million  debt issuance costs of million and dividends paid on our common stock of million and to increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
in  changes in working capital and outstanding checks generated cash of million as compared to million in this increase was due primarily to strong cash collections of trade accounts receivable in in  we used cash from operations of million  net borrowings of revolving loans of million  other debt borrowings of million and net proceeds from stock based compensation issuances of million to fund net capital expenditures of million  the repayment of debt of million  our acquisitions of the metal vacuum closures operations of grup vemsa  sl and white cap operations in brazil for million  net of cash acquired  decreases in outstanding checks of million and dividends paid on our common stock of million and to increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
in  we used cash from operations of million and net proceeds from stock based compensation issuances of million to fund our acquisition of the white cap operations in venezuela for million  net of cash acquired  net capital expenditures of million  decreases in outstanding checks of million  net payments of debt of million and dividends paid on our common stock of million and to increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
since  we have maintained a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents to ensure our access to liquidity 
our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million 
in february  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  payable on march  to the holders of record of our common stock on march  the cash payment for this quarterly dividend is expected to be approximately million 

table of contents at december   we had million of total consolidated indebtedness 
in addition  at december   after taking into account letters of credit of million  we had million and cdn million of revolving loans available to be borrowed under our credit agreement 
under our credit agreement  we also have available to us an uncommitted incremental loan facility in an amount of up to an additional million  and we may incur additional indebtedness as permitted by our credit agreement and our other instruments governing our indebtedness 
revolving loans under our credit agreement may be used for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
revolving loans may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed over the life of our credit agreement until their final maturity on june  at december  and  there were no revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement 
because we sell metal containers used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season 
due to our seasonal requirements  which generally peak sometime in the summer or early fall  we may incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
in recent years  our incremental peak seasonal working capital requirements were approximately million  which were funded through a combination of revolving loans under our credit agreement and cash on hand 
for  we expect to fund our peak seasonal working capital requirements with cash on hand and revolving loans available under our credit agreement 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of to million  principal amortization payments of bank term loans under our credit agreement and other outstanding debt agreements of million in  million in  million in and million in  cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock of approximately million assuming our board of directors continues to approve dividends at the same level  annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested  which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest  none of which is estimable at this time payments in were not significant  our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under our credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  the notes and the notes  payments of approximately to million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which may increase annually thereafter  and payments for pension benefit plan contributions which will be dependent on the funded status of our pension benefit plans 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service  tax obligations  pension benefit plan contributions  share repurchases required under our stock incentive plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under our credit agreement  to finance any such acquisition 

table of contents our credit agreement and the indentures with respect to the notes and the notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets  pay dividends and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt obligations interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations other postretirement benefit obligations total these amounts represent expected cash payments of our long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our variable rate long term debt  after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements  at prevailing interest rates at december  purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures 
obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded 
other postretirement benefit obligations have been actuarially determined through the year based on current legislation  there are no significant minimum required contributions to our pension benefit plans in at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under our credit agreement 
you should also read notes   and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials subject to contractual lag periods for resin costs and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs  such as labor and other manufacturing costs 

table of contents because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these interest rate swap agreements  we pay fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent and receive floating rates of interest based on three month libor or euribor  as appropriate 
these interest rate swap agreements mature as follows million and cdn million in  million in and million in depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization charges in march  we approved a plan to reduce costs at our hannover  germany closures manufacturing facility  which plan included the termination of employees 
total costs related to this plan of million for employee severance and benefit costs were recognized in cash payments of million were paid in remaining cash payments of million are expected to be paid in the first quarter of in  as part of our ongoing effort to streamline operations and reduce costs  we approved plans to close our metal food container manufacturing facility in tarrant  alabama  our plastic container manufacturing facility in richmond  virginia and our closures manufacturing facility in turkey and to consolidate various administrative positions within our european closures operations 
in february  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our tarrant  alabama metal food container manufacturing facility 
our plan included the termination of approximately employees and other related plant exit costs 
total costs of million for the rationalization of this facility were recognized in and consisted of million for employee severance and benefits  million for plant exit costs and million for the acceleration of depreciation to write down equipment for abandonment upon the exit of the facility  offset by million for a non cash curtailment gain for other postretirement benefits 
we have ceased operations at this facility and all cash has been expended 
we expect to sell the building for estimated proceeds at or in excess of its net book value 
in march  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our richmond  virginia plastic container manufacturing facility 
our plan included the termination of approximately employees and other related plant exit costs 
the total costs for the rationalization of this facility of million consisted of million for employee severance and benefits  million for plant exit costs and million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets 
we recognized substantially all of these costs in we have ceased operations at this facility and all cash has been expended 
during  we approved and announced to employees in our closures business plans to consolidate various administrative positions and streamline operations in europe and exit our closures manufacturing facility in turkey 
our plans included the termination of approximately employees  the relocation of certain operations into existing facilities and other related plant exit costs 
the total costs for this rationalization of million consisted of million for employee severance and benefits  million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets and million for plant exit costs 
we recognized substantially all of these costs in and have ceased operations at the turkey facility 
remaining cash payments of million are expected in in  we approved and announced plans to exit our metal food container manufacturing facilities in st 
paul  minnesota and stockton  california 
under these plans  we terminated employees and recognized total charges of million 
we have ceased operations at these facilities and expect to sell the owned facilities for estimated proceeds at or in excess of their respective net book values 
remaining cash payments of million are expected in and thereafter 

table of contents under our rationalization plans  we made cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additional cash spending of approximately million is expected for our plans in and thereafter 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
we continually evaluate cost reduction opportunities in our business  including rationalizations of our existing facilities through plant closings and downsizings 
we use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns 
critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for pension expense and obligations  rationalization charges and acquisition reserves and testing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for non callable high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension benefit plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense  while an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate would impact our annual pension expense by approximately million 
for  we decreased our domestic discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension benefit plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets will remain at percent in you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on market participant perspectives when available and our business plans for the acquired entities  which include eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our tests for impairment require us to make assumptions regarding the expected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units 
these assumptions are based on our internal forecasts 
developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from these forecasts 
if an impairment were to be identified  it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a standard that establishes a single authoritative definition for fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
as of january   we completed the adoption of this standard which did not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
in december  the fasb issued a standard on business combinations which retains the fundamental requirements in existing us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and an acquirer be identified for each business combination 
this standard establishes principles and requirements for the reporting entity in a business combination  including recognition and measurement in the financial statements of the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest at their fair values at the acquisition date 
this standard also requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition 
this standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  in addition  this standard requires that any changes in an acquired deferred tax account or related valuation allowance that occur after january  will be recognized as adjustments to income tax expense 
the initial adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  our unrecognized tax benefit positions will impact our effective tax rate if recognition of such positions is required in future periods 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
forward looking statements the statements we have made in risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this annual report which are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and the securities exchange act of  as amended

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and  with respect to our international closures operations and our canadian plastic container operations  from foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow 
to achieve our objective  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our average outstanding total debt  respectively 
in may  we issued million principal amount of the notes and utilized the net proceeds from such issuance to prepay variable rate term loans under our credit agreement  significantly reducing our variable rate debt 
at december   our outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements  was approximately percent of our outstanding total debt 
we manage a significant portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under our credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under our credit agreement

in an effort to minimize foreign currency exchange risk  we have financed our acquisitions of our european and canadian operations primarily with term loans borrowed under our credit agreement denominated in euros and canadian dollars  respectively 
our european operations include non euro denominated entities in turkey  poland and the united kingdom 
we also have operations in asia and south america that are not considered significant to our consolidated financial statements

commodity pricing risk we purchase raw materials for our products such as metal and resins 
these raw materials are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these raw materials due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage a portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
the natural gas swap agreements that we entered into for were not significant 
during  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
as of december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price
