item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  in item overview nautilus  inc  a fitness products company headquartered in vancouver  washington  is committed to providing innovative  quality solutions to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle 
our principal business activities include designing  developing  sourcing and marketing high quality cardiovascular and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer home use  primarily in the united states and canada 
our products are sold under some of the most recognized brand names in the fitness industry  including nautilus  bowflex  universal and schwinn fitness 
we market our products through two business segments direct and retail  each representing a distinct marketing distribution channel 
our direct business offers products directly to consumers through direct advertising  catalogs and the internet 
our retail business offers our products through a network of independent retail companies located in the united states and canada  as well as internet based merchants 
economic and market conditions have been  and continue to be  disruptive and volatile 
these conditions  including reduced business and consumer confidence  disruptions in the residential housing market  materially reduced consumer credit availability for our customers and increased unemployment  all of which have contributed to reductions in consumer spending  particularly on discretionary products such as our home fitness equipment 
during  we implemented cost reduction efforts to adjust for the decline in revenue  and in early we announced plans to initiate additional cost reductions aimed at further reducing operating costs and improving the overall alignment of spending and anticipated revenue 
during the third quarter of  in order to focus exclusively on the development of our direct and retail businesses  management committed to a plan for the complete divestiture of our commercial business 
consequently  our commercial business has been classified as a discontinued operation 
management s actions to reduce costs in our continuing and discontinued operations and focus on the development of our direct and retail businesses are summarized as follows during we restructured our workforce and reduced the number of employees in our corporate headquarters and our manufacturing and distribution functions to better match the requirements of our business  we conducted a thorough review of our information technology costs to better align computer systems and support services to our restructured business model  resulting in significant savings related to software purchases  maintenance agreements and licensing fees  we terminated our lease for our corporate headquarters facility in vancouver  washington  and entered into a new lease for substantially less space and substantially lower rent payments in the same building  we terminated a third party warehouse distribution service agreement for our us service parts inventory  which now will be distributed from our company facility  and we committed to a plan for the complete divestiture of our commercial business  and completed the sale of certain assets of our stairmaster and schwinn fitness commercial product lines 
in february  we completed an agreement for the sale of certain assets of our nautilus commercial fitness product lines 
during we restructured our workforce to better match the requirements of our redefined business segment organization  
table of contents we closed our tulsa commercial manufacturing facility and transferred operations to third party manufacturers in asia and our owned manufacturing facility in independence  virginia  we consolidated our us distribution centers and aligned the products by segment to allow for more efficient product handling  we ceased direct business sales through our australian subsidiary and closed those operations  we sold our apparel division  dash america  inc d b a pearl izumi  we closed our canadian call center and consolidated our call center operations in vancouver  washington to achieve better economies of scale  we terminated a number of marketing arrangements to better align our spending with our revised operating plans  we reduced our revolving line of credit to a level better suited for our anticipated borrowing  and we exercised our right to terminate agreements to acquire a manufacturing operation located in china 
substantially all of our revenues are generated from product sales 
our net sales for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to net sales of million in the prior year 
the decline in net sales primarily was due to a general decline in consumer spending on discretionary products and reduced availability of consumer financing 
gross profit margin increased to for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year  primarily due to reduced distribution costs resulting from the consolidation of our distribution centers  a decrease in shipping costs arising from a change in our primary outbound freight carrier and a decrease in warranty costs 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to operating expenses of million in the prior year 
the decrease in operating expenses reflects the impact of management s efforts to better align spending with current and anticipated revenue levels through significant reductions in advertising expenses  employment costs and other expenses 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million  respectively  in expenses associated with our restructuring initiatives 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include intangible asset impairment charges of million 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we reported an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   compared to a benefit of million in the prior year 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 

table of contents revenue recognition product sales and shipping revenues  net of promotional discounts  rebates and return allowances  are recorded when products are shipped and title passes to customers 
retail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier 
we record taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis  excluded from revenue 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded gross  meaning they are included in both revenue and cost of sales 
many of our direct business customers finance their purchases through a third party credit provider  for which we pay a commission or customer financing fee to the credit provider 
we record sales for these transactions based on the sales prices charged to our customers and record the commission or financing fee as a component of selling and marketing expense 
revenue is recognized net of applicable sales incentives  such as promotional discounts  rebates and return allowances 
we estimate the revenue impact of our incentive programs based on the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if the amount of our sales incentives can be reasonably estimated  we record the impact of such incentives at the later of the time we notify our customer of the sales incentive  or the time of the sale 
we estimate our liability for product returns based on historical experience and record the expected obligation as a reduction in revenue 
if actual return costs differ from our estimates  the recorded amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired 
our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows  market conditions  relative levels of risk  the cost of capital  terminal values  royalty rates  and the allocation of revenues  expenses and assets and liabilities to business segments 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and  thereby  could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
events could cause us to conclude that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired  resulting in the recognition of an impairment charge 
in  we recognized million in impairment charges related to intangible assets used in our continuing operations 
in we recognized a million impairment charge on goodwill of our retail business 
impairment charges of million and million related to intangible assets of discontinued operations were recognized in and  respectively 
accounts receivable valuation we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an aging of receivable balances  historical collection experience  our understanding of the current financial status of key customers and overall economic conditions 
we periodically review the credit worthiness of our customers to help gauge collectability and increase our allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is at risk 
we believe that by analyzing historical trends and monitoring potential collection problems  we have sufficient information to establish a reasonable estimate of the portion of our receivable balances that will not be collected 
however  since we cannot predict  with certainty  future changes in the financial stability of our customers or in the general economy  our actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
our ability to collect the amounts due from our customers could be impacted by various factors including a deterioration in the financial condition of a key customer  inability of customers to obtain bank credit lines  a significant slow down in the economy  our efforts to pursue collections  product quality matters or other customer disputes 
even 
table of contents though portions of our accounts receivable are protected by a security interest in products held by customers  any of the factors noted above may affect our ability to collect all  or a portion of  our receivable balances and could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory valuation our inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined based on the first in  first out method 
we establish provisions for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory based on inventory levels  expected product life and forecasted sales demand 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventory values  we are required to make judgments regarding the salability of our products  including an assessment of future demand compared with existing inventory levels  competitive factors  and changes in technology and product life cycles 
a significant change in any of the aforementioned factors could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
it is also possible that an increase in our inventory provisions may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for our products and we do not adjust our purchases from manufacturers accordingly 
product warranty obligations our products carry limited defined warranties for defects in materials or workmanship 
our product warranties generally obligate us to pay for the cost of replacement parts  cost of shipping the parts to our customers and  in certain instances  service labor costs 
at the time of sale  we record a liability for the estimated costs of fulfilling future warranty claims 
the estimated warranty costs are recorded as a component of cost of sales  based on historical warranty claim experience and available product quality data 
if necessary  we adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
our estimates of warranty expenses are based on significant judgment  and the frequency and cost of warranty claims are subject to variation 
warranty expenses are affected by the performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to the customer  product failure rates and variances in expected repair costs 
if warranty costs differ from our previous estimates  or if circumstances change such that the assumptions inherent in our previous estimates are no longer valid  we adjust our warranty reserve amount accordingly 
changes in the aforementioned factors or other warranty related assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period  based on the grant date fair value of our awards 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the black scholes merton option valuation model and determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards based on the closing market price on the day preceding the grant 
estimating the fair value of our stock based awards involves inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
the valuation of our stock options requires us to make assumptions regarding the expected term of our options  expected future volatility in the market price of our common stock  future risk free interest rates and future dividends  if any  expected to be approved by our board of directors 
we estimate future forfeitures  at the time of grant and in subsequent periods  based on historical experience  and recognize compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we reevaluate our estimate of forfeitures each quarter and  if applicable  recognize a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of the change if the revised estimate of forfeitures differs significantly from the previous estimate 
to the extent a stock based award is subject to performance conditions  the amount of expense we record in a given period  if any  may fluctuate depending upon our assessment of the probability of achieving the performance targets 

table of contents our stock based compensation expense may also change over time  as we review and adjust our compensation practices 
if factors  such as those discussed above  were to change and we used different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense in the future could be materially different from that reported in previous periods 
litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and any losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record expenses for litigation and loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of internal and external counsel  outcomes from similar litigation  status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates accordingly 
a significant change in our estimates  or an outcome that differs from the assumptions incorporated in our estimates  may have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
income tax provisions we account for income taxes based on the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be included  as income or expense  in the applicable tax return 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the enactment 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation 
significant judgments are required in determining tax provisions  evaluating tax positions and  when necessary  establishing or making adjustments to our valuation allowance 
such judgments require us to interpret existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our circumstances 
to the extent that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for that amount 
if our financial results or other relevant facts change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position  significant judgment would be applied in determining the effect of the change on our valuation allowance 
risks and uncertainties our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
our revenues will fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry  customer buying patterns  product innovation  the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products  our ability to manufacture or procure products to meet customer demand  the level of spending on  and effectiveness of  our media and advertising programs  and our ability to attract new customers and renew existing sales relationships 
in addition  our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors  including  among other things  the overall condition of the us economy and economies of other countries where we market our products and the availability of consumer credit  both in the us and abroad 
our profit margins may vary in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs 
profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products  product warranty costs  higher or lower fuel prices  and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing related 
table of contents services 
our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the relative success of strategies we employ to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization 
historically  our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and air advertisements  facility costs  operating costs of our information and communications systems  costs to develop and maintain our internet websites  bad debt costs and costs related to attracting and retaining key personnel 
in addition  our operating expenses have been impacted by asset impairment charges  restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses 
as a result of the above and other factors  our period to period operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
you should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies  both within and outside our industry 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability

a summary of such obligations as of december   including those related to our discontinued operations  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations total our purchase obligations are comprised of inventory purchase commitments 
because our inventory primarily is sourced from asia  we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  have been excluded from the contractual table above 
for further information  see note  income taxes  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
issues arising from china sales operation in  we recognized a million charge  included in discontinued operations  due to uncertainties regarding access to  and future recovery of  certain assets of our china sales operation 
in  we recovered a portion of these assets and  as a result of this and other changes in circumstances  we reduced the previously accrued loss amount by million 
at december  we have an allowance of million due to uncertainties regarding the future recovery of our china trade receivables 
off balance sheet arrangements at times  we become involved in third party lease and financing arrangements which assist our customers in obtaining funds to purchase our products 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guarantee or other recourse provisions 
our financing partner reviews consumer credit information in evaluating the risk of default prior to extending credit to our customers 
we rely on the quality of our partner s review and our own risk assessment in determining whether to proceed with a recourse transaction 
at december  and  the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million and million  respectively 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this arrangement 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims

the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of 
table of contents indemnifications 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no liabilities are recorded at december  seasonality we expect our sales from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally 
sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters  and are generally weakest in the second quarter 
we believe the broadcast of national network season finales and seasonal weather patterns influence television viewership and cause our television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
in addition  during the spring and summer months  consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities  including exercise  which impacts sales of fitness equipment used indoors 
this seasonality can have a significant affect on our operating results  inventory levels and working capital needs 
new accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncements had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
