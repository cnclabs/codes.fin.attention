item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial market segments 
we have five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group adp  engraving group  engineering technologies group  and electronics and hydraulics 
our continuing objective is to identify those of our businesses which hold the greatest potential for profitable growth  and direct our resources to supporting both organic growth and acquisition opportunities in those businesses 
our customer base in the food service equipment  automotive  us residential housing and general industrial sectors have all experienced difficult recessionary market conditions that have negatively impacted our sales volume 
during the second half of  we began to see an uneven sales recovery across all of our segments  indicating that end user markets have begun to stabilize 
this trend is evidenced by an upturn in sales beginning in the third quarter of  as sales were up in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter 
we remain cautiously optimistic  however  as we expect to continue to experience challenging market conditions in the near term  especially in the construction and housing markets 
since the beginning of  our focus had been on reducing our cost structure through company wide headcount reductions  plant consolidations  procurement savings  and improved productivity in all aspects of our operations 
over the course of their phase in  these cost reduction efforts have allowed the company to substantially improve margins and increase its bottom line despite substantial year over year sales declines 
the cost reduction initiatives that have been undertaken  which are expected to deliver sustainable annual savings of million per year  allowed the company to improve margins and improve its bottom line in despite a year over year sales decline of 
substantially all of our remaining restructuring initiatives were completed during  and we expect to see their full impact in our run rate beginning in  with an additional million of savings 
in addition to the focus on cost reductions  we have improved the company s liquidity through better working capital management  more strategic capital expenditures  and sale of excess land and buildings 
we retired substantially all of our private placement debt during  and in  we further reduced our net debt by an additional million even while expending million on dividends  million on capital expenditures  and million in total pension plan contributions 
million of these pension contributions were voluntary  and  at current borrowing rates  will be accretive to future earnings 
our net debt to capital ratio improved from on june  to as of june  going forward  we are turning our attention to driving market share gains in a highly competitive environment coupled with what we expect to be low growth in our end user markets 
each of our business units has developed a series of top line initiatives that we believe will provide opportunities for market share gains which should supplement future natural growth in our markets 
these growth initiatives include new product introductions  expansion of product offerings through private labeling  geographic expansion of sales coverage  the use of new channels of sales  leveraging strategic customer relationships  development of energy efficient products  new applications for existing products and technology and next generation products and services for our end user markets 
at the same time  over the past several years we have created a strong lean enterprise culture with in our business units whereby we seek continuous improvement in our manufacturing processes  working capital management  and overall cost structure 
because of the diversity of the company s businesses  end user markets and geographic locations  management does not use specific external indices to predict the future performance of the company  other than general information about broad macroeconomic trends 
each of our individual business units serves niche markets and attempts to identify trends other than general business and economic conditions which are specific to their businesses and which could impact their performance 
those units report any such information to senior management  which uses it to the extent relevant to assess the future performance of the company 
a description of any such material trends is described below in the applicable segment analysis 
we monitor a number of key performance indicators including net sales  income from operations  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin restructuring costs income from operations backlog realizable within year net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales decline growth net sales decreased million in  a decrease from the prior year 
organic sales decreased million or  with a positive offset due to exchange rates of million 
the decrease was due to the fact that sales for the first half of fiscal were substantially below sales levels in the first half of fiscal severe recessionary conditions did not begin to significantly affect the company until the second quarter of fiscal sales for the second half of fiscal were higher than sales in the second half of in the engineering technologies group reported record sales due to several large projects  while the engraving group sales were flat year over year 
the food service equipment group was down slightly  and the adp and electronics and hydraulics groups continued to experience sales declines due to ongoing depressed conditions in the housing and dump truck dump trailer markets 
net sales decreased million in  a decrease from the prior year 
organic sales decreased million or  with the remaining difference due to exchange rates 
while we experienced a recession driven decrease in sales across all segments except for the engineering technologies group  sales in our adp and electronics and hydraulics segments had the most significant declines  as continuing downturns in the housing  white goods  and heavy truck industries negatively impacted the sales of these segments 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin increased in to from in this increase in margin is due to our successful reduction in our cost structure  as well as reductions in materials and value added costs 
we believe that our cost reduction actions better position our operations for higher gross margins as macroeconomic recovery occurs  as demonstrated by higher margins on lower sales in our gross profit margin increased in fiscal to from in restructuring during  the company incurred restructuring expense of million related to both headcount reductions and a strategic realignment of our manufacturing footprint 
this expense consisted primarily of million of restructuring costs in the food service equipment group  where we consolidated a facility in dallas into our nogales  mexico facility 
additional expense of million was incurred in the european operations of the engraving group  where we closed one facility and reduced headcount across the continent  and in our adp group  where the costs of a facility move were offset by the settlement of the multi employer pension liability at the bartonville  illinois adp facility  which was closed in july in  the company incurred restructuring expense of million 
of this amount  million consisted of costs to close the bartonville facility 
in the third quarter of  the company closed an additional three plants  one each in the food service equipment  engraving  and electronics and hydraulics groups at a cost of million 
production from these plants was absorbed into other existing facilities as part of our goal of reducing our global manufacturing footprint 
also during  the company reduced its us based employment by across all divisions in order to reduce costs in response to the macroeconomic recessionary environment and its expected effects on the company in the immediate future 
the company recorded million of pre tax restructuring expense related to this initiative 
income from operations income from operations during increased million from excluding million of impairment charges taken during  income from operations increased million 
this improvement reflects the impact of restructuring actions and other cost reductions taken during  as well as the partial impact of additional restructuring projects in the food service equipment and engraving groups performed during the year partially offset by reduced sales volume 
income from operations during decreased million  or when compared to this includes the impact of million of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the year  as well as restructuring costs of million during the year 
absent these costs  income from operations decreased million  or  from  which is attributable to the year over year decline in sales offset by the aforementioned improvements in our cost structure 
discussion of the performance of all of our groups is more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
income taxes the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or an effective rate of  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  and million  or an effective rate of  for the fiscal year ended june  changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  size of the company s income or loss and any one time activities occurring during the period 
the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by a benefit of million from the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily related to foreign loss carryforwards whose recovery was assessed as more likely than not based on events occurring during the year ended june  the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes  ii the million impairment for which only million of tax benefit could be realized  as the goodwill had no tax basis  iii a benefit totaling million from the reversal of the deferred tax liability that was no longer required due to a change in the us tax classification of one of our foreign entities  iv a benefit of million related primarily to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the second quarter and v a benefit related to the receipt of million of nontaxable life insurance proceeds during the first quarter 
capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be approximately equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in and  capital expenditures of million and million were below our annual depreciation of million and million  respectively  and reflect our strategy of cash conservation and debt reduction in response to the current recessionary environment 
backlog backlog at june  increased million to million when compared to fiscal  a increase when compared to prior year 
this increase is correspondent with our increase in sales volume  and was driven primarily by higher backlog in the electronics and hydraulics group 
backlog was roughly flat year over year for our other segments 
segment analysis in thousands food service equipment compared to compared to change change sales income loss from operations operating income margin net sales for the year ended june  decreased million  or  from the same period one year earlier 
the year over year top line sales comparisons were negatively impacted by a rollout at one of the yum brands restaurants that generated million in sales in the prior year quarter 
the effects of foreign exchange rates accounted for million of this total  and the remainder was organic decline offset by price increases 
pricing pressure offset by market share gains led to a organic sales decline in our refrigeration solutions businesses walk in cooler and refrigerated cabinets businesses  which was impacted by the moderation in construction  and we showed a organic decline in our cooking solutions and custom solutions businesses 
despite the decline  the segment continues to grow market share through its buying group relationships and through new product offerings 
our procon business posted double digit year over year sales growth driven by strength in the beverage customer base and increasing demand from industrial customers 
income from operations for fiscal increased million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
fiscal included a million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of the american associated industries aai operating unit 
excluding the prior year impairment  the group s fiscal income from operations increased million  or 
we are continuing to see a recovery in the cooking solutions group as we are benefiting from improving market conditions  increased market penetration in key dealer buying groups and new products 
the impact of the year over year volume decreases and market pricing pressures was more than offset by cost reductions due to facility consolidations  staffing reductions  supply chain cost reductions and labor productivity increases 
with the completion of our consolidation of two cooking solutions group facilities into nogales  mexico  during the year  the beginning of will mark the full run rate of our initiatives from the last two years 
net sales in decreased million  or  from the effects of foreign exchange rates accounted for million of the decline 
when removing the effect of foreign exchange rate impact  sales decreased million  or  when compared with the same period one year earlier 
we achieved slight organic growth in our refrigerated solutions businesses generally due to market share gains and nominal price increases 
our cooking solutions and custom solutions businesses experienced sales declines primarily due to the market deterioration that began in the second fiscal quarter 
income from operations for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
excluding the effect of a million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the third quarter  operating income was approximately flat year over year 
a decline in sales volume was offset by staffing reductions  material and labor productivity improvements  and nominal price increases 
these savings initiatives were partially offset by commodity cost increases in the first half and negative sales mix in the first quarter 
air distribution products compared to compared to change change sales income loss from operations n a n a operating income margin net sales for the fiscal year ended june  declined or million 
standex evaluates the available market for adp by monitoring new housing start data  published monthly by the us department of housing and urban development 
sales to the group s customers typically lag new home starts by three to four months 
comparing the period from april to march to the same period one year earlier  housing starts declined 
pricing declined and sales unit volume was lower by 
adp continues to pursue market share gains through its traditional wholesaler channels by emphasizing our ability to service nationwide wholesalers and large do it yourself retailers through our network of factory locations and by working in conjunction with our wholesalers to target contractor business 
we continue to roll out our flex duct product  and have also expanded our product line to include other hvac supplies  whi ch enables us to be a one stop shop for our customers in a down market so that they can more easily meet minimum order requirements and thereby improve their working capital management 
the relatively low decline in unit volume as compared to the precipitous decline in housing starts is a testament to the success of this strategy  which we expect to leave us well positioned when markets recover 
income from operations for the year ended june  decreased million to a loss of million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
pricing declines  totaling million  and lower volume were the most significant reasons for the change in earnings 
metal costs were million less than fiscal  million of which was the result of a lower of cost or market charge recorded in the third quarter of decreases in hourly and salaried workforces implemented in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  lower workers compensation costs and lower distribution costs comprised the majority of the remaining offset to price and volume declines 
net sales for declined million  or  from a volume decline of was driven by a similar decline in housing starts of during the year 
income from operations for was million  an increase of million from price increases implemented in early partially offset raw steel price increases and declining sales volume 
these raw material price increases were also offset by significant year over year cost savings achieved from the shutdown of the bartonville  illinois  facility in july and salaried and hourly workforce reductions which took place primarily in the third quarter of the year 
additionally  the group recorded expenses of million during the third quarter of to write down inventory of higher cost metal purchased in the first half the year to its fair market value 
engraving compared to compared to change change sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the engraving group were flat from fiscal levels at million compared to million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of million in fiscal year without the favorable foreign exchange  sales declined year over year 
while our roll plate and machinery equipment sales continue to experience a soft market due to tight capital spending budgets at our customers  our innovent division s sales increased  showing the benefit of our expansion and broadening of our focus from tools to technology driven system solutions 
our mold texturizing businesses continue to strengthen based on the release of new automotive programs  which also creates an improved product mix due to their generally higher margins 
we expect this trend to continue into  and will continue to seek out this business through further expansion into emerging markets  includi ng a strategic acquisition in india which will enable us to capitalize on the fast growing indian automotive market and the opening of a third facility in china 
we believe that global presence  as well as our technology and responsiveness to automotive oem customers needs  will allow us to remain the number one choice for their texturing services 
income from operations increased by million  or  when compared to fiscal restructuring the business and significant cost reduction efforts implemented in  as well as headcount reductions in our european operations  were significant in the improvement of operating income year over year 
with our new lower cost structure and focus on growth  we have demonstrated our ability to improve income from operations on flat sales  and we anticipate that we will be able to favorably leverage future sales growth and further improve our operating performance 
in addition  the group continues to expand the use of lean enterprise techniques and develop cutting edge technology throughout its operations in order to further improve profitability and responsiveness to our customers 
in  net sales in the engraving group decreased by million  or from fiscal levels 
the group experienced a widespread decrease in sales of mold texturizing for automotive oem platform work in most geographic regions  especially europe  in due to oem s launching fewer new auto platforms and delaying existing programs 
lower mold texturing sales were partially offset by stronger sales in core forming tools and filtration screens related to our innovent business 
north american operations sales declined and international operations sales declined 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million when compared to fiscal restructuring measures taken during the year consist of the completion of the closure of our ohio mold texturizing and new jersey roll embossing facilities begun in  and an additional consolidation during the year of our michigan mold texturizing facility 
in addition  the group continued to expand the use of lean enterprise techniques throughout its operations in order to further improve profitability and responsiveness to our customers 
engineering technologies compared to compared to change change sales income from operations operating income margin net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses continued to experience strong demand across its energy  aerospace  missile  aviation  and marine end user markets 
we completed contracts related to nasa hardware for the ares and orion programs 
in addition  we secured new aerospace and tank hardware contracts during the year 
while the federal government has reduced its funding for heavy lift launch vehicles  we expect that the continued diversification of our end markets will offset this trend 
income from operations increased by million or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the increase was primarily due to growth with several aerospace launch vehicle customers 
a favorable product mix  cost cutting initiatives  and improved manufacturing efficiencies also contributed to the performance 
net sales increased million in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses experienced steady performance and we secured new contracts for tank systems for the growing unmanned aerial vehicles market and contracts for tooling and hardware related to nasa s orion and ares rocket programs 
in addition this group saw an increase in demand for land based turbine components 
income from operations decreased million or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the reduced profitability was the result of a shift in mix to lower margin products for the energy markets and away from aerospace sales 
the introduction of lean manufacturing techniques as a regular element of daily production is helping to improve margins in this segment 
electronics and hydraulics compared to compared to change change sales income from operations operating income margin net sales for the electronics and hydraulics segment decreased million  or  when compared to although sales were down year over year  sales in the second half of the year were up driven by improvements in the automotive  appliance  computer  toy and security markets for our electronics unit 
sales were also buoyed by the reed switch product line  where sales increased year over year  and by significant new business in the medical  hvac  and toy switch markets 
sales at our hydraulics unit continued to be plagued by depressed market conditions in the domestic and international dump truck trailer sectors due to a lack of available credit to customers  as well as a high inventories in the used equipment market 
while sales have stabilized in some of our traditional oem customers  we also continue to seek new applications and geographic markets for our products 
income from operations for increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
during  we took aggressive measures to reduce our cost structure  including plant closures and workforce reductions 
as a result  the electronics unit showed a basis point increase in operating margin year over year 
the hydraulics unit  where we reduced our workforce by over  also showed an increase in operating income compared to despite significantly lower sales 
both these improvements reflect the full year impact of our restructuring efforts 
net sales declined by million  or in when compared to the same period one year earlier 
for the electronics unit  the decline is attributable to the global recession in the automotive  white goods and hvac market segments  which experienced steep declines during the second half of fiscal within the hydraulics unit  the global decline in new orders for dump trucks and dump trailers was dramatic  as the recession resulted in a general lack of credit availability for buyers  as well as an excess of used and repossessed equipment flooding the market 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier  due primarily to the year over year sales decline of over 
sales demand for this segment was negatively impacted by recessionary market conditions that existed in the automotive  housing white goods and off road  construction vehicles  end user segments 
in the electronics unit  aggressive cost reduction measures and plant closures resulted in a moderate increase in earnings as a percent of net sales 
in the hydraulics unit  we have successfully introduced new capital equipment to improve productivity and closed one facility 
corporate  restructuring and other compared to compared to change change income loss from operations corporate gain on sale of real estate n a n a restructuring corporate expenses increased million  or compared to this increase was primarily due to expenses for bonuses and stock compensation expenses that were not accrued in due to austerity measures taken in the face of the recession

also  in  there was no expense for current year awards under the company s performance based long term stock compensation program  as we determined that the achievement of the performance criteria for outstanding awards was not probable  whereas in these awards resulted in expense of million 
discontinued operations in  the company sold substantially all the assets of the berean christian stores berean business in an all cash deal resulting in the recognition of a pre tax gain of million 
as the former owner of berean  the company is party under a number of operating leases which were assigned to the purchaser of the business for the remaining initial terms of the leases at the stated lease costs 
the company remained an obligor of these leases until the expiration of the initial terms 
in the second quarter of  noting berean s deteriorating operating performance and precarious financial position  the company recorded liabilities of million  net of estimated subleases  in anticipation of the impairment of leases remaining under the obligation 
in june  berean filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and  in july  its assets were sold to a third party under section of the code 
the new owner of the berean assets has infused capital into the business  and we believe the berean bookstores can now be operated successfully as a going concern 
as part of this transaction  the company agreed to provide lease supplement payments to the new owner of the berean assets 
these payments included an upfront payment of million and additional payments totaling million which will be made in equal monthly installments through december the company will remain an obligor of the leases assumed by the new owner  however  our obligation has been reduced for locations where the new owner was able to obtain rent concessions 
in addition  the company remains responsible for three sites formerly operated by berean

additionally  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  working capital increased million due to robust sales growth of  or million in the fourth quarter of investing activities provided million of cash during  including million from sales of excess real estate during the year 
we used million for capital expenditures  which reflects our current strategy of reduced capital spending during the recession 
cash inflows were also augmented by life insurance proceeds of million resulting from the death of a former executive and the penalty free withdrawal of excess funding from our policies 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company completed the sale of an excess facility located in lyon  france 
the company anticipates recording pretax gain of approximately million and will realize cash proceeds of million  net of associated costs 
during the year ended june   we used million of cash for financing activities 
while we generated sufficient cash flow during the year to further pay down debt  we elected not to do so in order to make voluntary pension contributions and to add an additional million of interest rate swaps 
while these actions have resulted in the net pay down of only million in debt  the pension contribution will be accretive to earnings in and we have fixed a significant portion of our revolving debt for the next five years at historically low interest rates 
capital structure we have in place a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility with seven participating banks which originated in september funds available under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisitions 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of june   the effective rate of interest for outstanding borrowings under the facility was 
we are required to pay an annual fee of on the maximum credit line 
in the past two years  the company has undertaken a series of initiatives to generate cash and reduce debt  including cost reductions  improved working capital management  and plant consolidations 
these initiatives have enabled us to pay down substantially all of our private placement debt 
as of june   we had borrowings of million under the facility 
we believe that the remaining million available provides us with sufficient capacity to meet both our short and long term liquidity needs 
our facility also allows for up to million of private placement debt in addition to our revolving borrowings 
our funded debt agreements contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants  as well as specific financial covenants 
the company s current financial covenants under the facility are as follows interest coverage ratio the company is required to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense for the trailing twelve months of at least ebit is defined in the revolving credit facility to specifically exclude extraordinary and certain defined items such as non cash restructuring charges and goodwill impairment 
at june   the company s interest coverage ratio was leverage ratio the company s ratio of funded debt to trailing twelve month ebitda  defined as ebit plus depreciation and amortization  may not exceed at june   the company s leverage ratio was consolidated net worth the company is required to maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million plus of cumulative net income since the inception of the agreement 
consolidated net worth is defined as the company s net worth as adjusted for unamortized pension losses not to exceed million and certain foreign exchange gains and losses

no amounts were outstanding under these facilities at june  and at june   and  we had standby letters of credit outstanding  primarily for insurance purposes  of million and million  respectively 
through our shelf registration statement on file with the sec  depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets  we may issue unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series  which may consist of notes  debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings 
our primary cash requirements in addition to day to day operating needs include interest and mandatory principal payments  capital expenditures  and dividends 
our primary sources of cash for these requirements are cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the facility 
we expect to spend between million on capital expenditures during  and expect that depreciation and amortization expense for the year will be approximately million and million  respectively 
in july  we entered into a series of swap agreements with one and two year terms effectively converting interest payments on our long term debt from variable to fixed rates 
we converted interest payments on million of debt due under the facility from variable rates based on libor to a weighted average effective rate of based on our current leverage ratio 
the one year swaps totaling million expired in july the two years swaps totaling million expired in july in june  we entered into an additional million of five year floating to fixed rate swaps 
on a go forward basis  these swaps will convert our interest payments to a weighted average effective rate of based on our current leverage ratio 
additionally  due to the expiration of the swaps in july  our rate on the remaining million of outstanding revolving debt balances will return to the historically low libor rates the market is currently experiencing 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of net income of million 
also affecting equity were dividends of million  unfavorable foreign currency movements of million and unrealized pension losses of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises and stock based compensation in the current year 
the company s net debt to capital percentage improved from to in due the year over year change in cash and the contribution of the current year net income to retained earnings

other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro  british pound sterling pound  mexican peso  and chinese yuan 
during the current year  the pound sterling and euro have experienced decreases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency

we renegotiated two union contracts during  and in each case reached an agreement 
a total of two union contracts covering approximately employees will expire in the company maintains good working relations with all of its unions  however  there can be no guarantee that agreements can be reached in future negotiations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectability of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount of the asset 
the company s annual test for impairment is performed using a may st measurement date 
we have identified our reporting units for impairment testing as our twelve operating segments  which are aggregated into our five reporting segments as disclosed in note industry segment information 
the test for impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s carrying value is compared to the implied fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as quoted market prices are not available for the company s reporting units  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model income approach 
this method uses various assumptions that are specific to each individual reporting unit in order to determine the fair value 
in addition  the company compares the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its overall market capitalization 
our annual impairment testing at each reporting unit relied on assumptions surrounding general market conditions  short term growth rates  and terminal growth rates ranging from to  and detailed management forecasts of future cash flows prepared by the relevant reporting unit 
fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 
an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points in the analysis would not result in the identification of any impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  changes in assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
the most significant assumption involved in the company s determination of fair value is the cash flow projections of each reporting unit 
certain of our reporting units have been significantly impacted by the current global economic downturn  specifically the air distribution products group  which has been significantly impacted by the declines in new housing starts and other factors impacting residential housing 
if the effects of the current global economic environment are protracted or the recovery is slower than we have projected estimates of future cash flows for each reporting unit may be insufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting units  requiring the company to re assess its conclusions related to fair value and the recoverability of goodwill 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some postretirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of in the us is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
the us discount rate of reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a twenty five basis point change in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million per year 
a twenty five basis point basis point change in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million annually 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asu requires new disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for the company s third quarter of fiscal year other than requiring additional disclosures  the adoption of this new guidance did not and will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu amends asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the update replaces the concept of allocating revenue consideration amongst deliverables in a multiple element revenue arrangement according to fair value with an allocation based on selling price 
asu also establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of revenue deliverables sold in multiple element revenue arrangements 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or management s estimate of an element s stand alone selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments in this update also require an allocation of selling price a mongst deliverables be performed based upon each deliverable s relative selling price to total revenue consideration  rather than on the residual method previously permitted 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  but then requires retrospective application of its provisions from the beginning of the fiscal year 
we will adopt the amendment provisions of asu on july   the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asu revenue recognition milestone method asu 
asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved after the adoption date 
early adoption is permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we will adopt this provision on july   the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan and non qualified defined contribution plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk we are exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
the transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service on intercompany accounts 
we also mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
the contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend payments  loan payments  and materials purchases  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june  and  the fair value of the company s open foreign exchange contracts were not material 
our primary translation risk is with the euro  british pound sterling  and chinese yuan 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of any these foreign currencies to the us dollar at june   would not result in a material change in our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s effective rate on variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement decreased from at june  to at june  our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
in july and june  we entered into a series of swap agreements with two and five year terms effectively converting interest payments on million of debt due under our revolving credit agreement from variable rates based on libor to a fixed rate of based on the company s effective leverage ratio at june  due to the impact of the swaps  an increase in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense at june  concentration of credit risk we have a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for all commodities used in its manufacturing processes 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good  there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
the adp  engineering technologies  food service equipment and electronics and hydraulics groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
in the past year  we have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including steel  copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
