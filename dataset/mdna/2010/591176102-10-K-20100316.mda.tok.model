item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements 
you should review the risk factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements 
please refer to special note regarding forward looking statements for more information

general we operate in twenty eight locations primarily in two distinct business segments i ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal recycling scrap metal recycling and ii product manufacturing  fabricating  and refining of lead and other metals lead fabricating 
the scrap metal recycling segment includes twenty four scrap metal recycling facilities located in new york  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  texas  mississippi  and west virginia  and an aluminum de ox plant located in syracuse  new york 
the lead fabricating segment includes four lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california and granite city  illinois 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for revenues  accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  the testing of goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
the critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized as goods are shipped  which generally is when title transfers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to customers 
title for the company s products transfers upon shipment  based on free on board fob terms 
brokerage sales are recognized upon receipt of materials by the customer and reported net of costs in product sales 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments in excess of reserves for such instances that would impact the ultimate collection of revenues therefore  no material provisions have been made when a sale is recognized 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from customers from product sales 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable includes a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  past experience with the accounts  changes in collection patterns and general industry conditions 
derivatives and hedging we are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations 
the primary risks managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
we use 
table of contents forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to protect against volatile commodity prices 
this process ensures a fixed selling price for the material we purchase and process 
we secure selling prices with pgm processors  in ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium  in incremental lots for material which we expect to purchase within an average to day time period 
however  these forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors are not subject to any hedge designation as they are considered within the normal sales exemption provided by asc topic we have in the past entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the new credit agreement entered into on march   with jp morgan chase bank  na  the company was required to terminate the million interest rate swap contract 
as a result  the company paid  to terminate the interest rate swap contract 
with the termination of the interest rate swap contract  no other interest rate swap agreement is outstanding 
goodwill the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of december and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for purposes of this testing  the company has determined to have six reporting units as follows lead fabricating and recycling  new york scrap recycling  pittsburgh scrap recycling  akron scrap recycling  newark pgm recycling and texas pgm recycling 
the youngstown operation was not assessed for impairment since its acquisition date and the date of our impairment testing were very close in time 
in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit  management allocates net deferred taxes and certain corporate maintained liabilities specifically allocable to each reporting unit to the net operating assets of each reporting unit 
the carrying amount is further reduced by any impairment charges made to other indefinite lived intangibles of a reporting unit 
since market prices of our reporting units are not readily available  we makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including sales volumes  profit margins  tax rates  capital spending  discount rate  and working capital changes 
forecasts of operating and selling  general and administrative expenses are generally based on historical relationships of previous years 
when applying the dcf model  the cash flows expected to be generated are discounted to their present value equivalent using a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the investment  as well as the time value of money 
this return is an overall rate based upon the individual rates of return for invested capital equity and interest bearing debt 
the return  known as the weighted average cost of capital wacc  is calculated by weighting the required returns on interest bearing debt and common equity in proportion to their estimated percentages in an expected capital structure 
for our analysis  we arrived at a discount rate of 
the inputs used in calculating the wacc include i average of capital structure ratios used in previous metalico acquisition valuations  ii an estimate of combined federal and state tax rates iii the cost of baa rated debt based on moody s seasoned corporate bond yields december  and iv a required return on equity determined under the modified capital asset pricing capm model 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment would be indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by 
table of contents comparing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  to the total fair value of the unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
at december   we performed our annual testing for impairment of goodwill 
as part of our assessment of the recovery of goodwill  we conducted an extensive valuation analysis using an income approach based upon a five year financial projection that took into consideration the current weak economic conditions with modest recovery occurring in the second half of the impairment analysis indicated that impairment existed at four reporting units and the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million for the year ended december  at december   the financial markets and industry in which we operate have improved from the conditions that existed at december  additionally  we have experienced an increase in the price of our common stock and total market capitalization value 
at december   the company s market capitalization exceeded total stockholders equity by approximately million 
significant improvements in economic conditions in industries in which we purchase and sell material have resulted in forecasts which  when used in our dcf model  support the carrying value of our goodwill in all of our reporting units 
as such  no indicators of impairment were identified for the year ended december  intangible assets and other long lived assets the company tests indefinite lived intangibles such as trademarks and tradenames for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible to the projected discounted cash flows produced from the intangible 
if the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted cash flows attributed to the intangible asset  the carrying value is no longer considered recoverable and the company will record impairment 
the company tests all finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  for impairment only if circumstances indicate that possible impairment exists 
to the extent actual useful lives are less than our previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization expense on a prospective basis 
we estimate useful lives of our intangible assets by reference to both contractual arrangements such as non compete covenants and current and projected cash flows for supplier and customer lists 
at december   no indicators of impairment were identified and no adjustments were made to the estimated lives of finite lived assets 
stock based compensation we recognize expense for equity based compensation ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the black scholes method 
the fair value of new stock options is estimated using a lattice pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility in our stock price  annual forfeiture rates  and exercise behavior 
these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

table of contents results of operations the company is divided into two industry segments scrap metal recycling  which breaks down into three general product categories  ferrous  non ferrous and platinum group metals  and lead fabricating 
the following table sets forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s scrap metal recycling segment and its lead fabricating segment  pounds and tons in thousands fiscal year ended fiscal year ended fiscal year ended december  december  december  net net net weight revenues weight revenues weight revenues scrap metal recycling ferrous metals weight in tons non ferrous metals weight in lbs 
platinum group metals weight in lbs 
total scrap metal recycling lead fabricating weight in lbs 
other total revenue the following table sets forth information regarding average metalico selling prices for the past eight quarters 
the fluctuation in pricing is due to many factors including domestic and export demand and our product mix 
average average average average ferrous non ferrous pgm lead for the quarter ending price per ton price per lb 
price per lb price per lb 
december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  for most scrap processors  early mirrored the weak pricing and anemic demand of the latter part of brought on by the global financial crisis 
starting in the middle of the second quarter of  domestic scrap prices have steadily improved mostly due to export demand 
this relative strength in export markets driven by improved production at foreign mills and attractiveness of us produced scrap  combined with recent signs of improvement in production at us domestic mills  have contributed to steady increases in ferrous scrap metal prices 
the results of the scrap metal recycling segment operations depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets 
scrap sold into the export market is principally shipped from the united states and europe  where in less developed countries scrap is consumed internally 
despite dramatic declines in domestic scrap demand  us export markets have been relatively robust in despite the global economic slowdown 
turkey has become a significant destination for us produced scrap of total exports in followed by china  south korea  taiwan and canada 
ultimately  the health of foreign economies and regions will dictate overseas demand for us produced scrap  although factors including a weak us dollar and more favorable freight rates may also further support the attractiveness of us processed scrap to overseas consumers 
freight costs attached to shipments overseas are passed through by processors to the customer 
higher freight costs can influence demand for domestic scrap as foreign mills may search elsewhere for less expensive sources 

table of contents the domestic steel industry s long climb back to better health continued into late steel producers in the united states  according to the american iron and steel institute aisi  produced nearly million tons of raw steel in the week ending december  this was up by percent compared to the week before and up dramatically from the less than million tons that were produced during the same week of the previous year 
as such  ferrous scrap prices took a sharp upward turn in december of the december rebound was anticipated by scrap recyclers as early as mid november  as domestic steel mill buyers began to reemerge to compete for material with overseas bulk cargo and containerized scrap buyers 
many processors have indicated that domestic mills may have allowed their inventories to sink too low early in the fourth quarter of  forcing them to pick up the pace of their buying in late november and december 
prices for non ferrous metals reached record levels in and fell sharply in the second half of on fears of a prolonged recession due in part to the world wide credit crisis 
increases in platinum and palladium prices throughout have been driven by strengthening industrial demand as well as speculative and investor interest in the anticipation of tightening medium term fundamentals  particularly from the demand side 
increases in demand  fueled by government stimulus  have boosted global auto production 
as a result  prices of platinum and palladium have rebounded sharply during in platinum was testing  an ounce in early december  signaling a rise of over the final quarter  a month increase of and from its low of mid november palladium rose over during the year  with prices increasing from an ounce at the start of to an ounce in early december a increase from november the lead fabricating segment was impacted by the price of lead

future capital requirements as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  availability under the loan agreement of million and total working capital of million 
as of december   our current liabilities totaled million 
we expect to fund our current working capital needs  interest payments and capital expenditures over the next twelve months with cash on hand and cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings available under the loan agreement and potentially available elsewhere  such as vendor financing  manufacturer financing  operating leases and other equipment lines of credit that are offered to us from time to time 
we may also access equity and debt markets for working capital  to restructure current debt and for possible acquisitions 
improvements in general economic conditions and operating results have allowed the company to reinstate salary reductions and increase its workforce through rehiring by approximately from a low point in april historically  the company has entered into negotiations with its lenders when it was reasonably concerned about potential breaches and prior to the occurrences of covenant defaults 
the company has renegotiated principal payments  interest expense and fees as well as the requisite performance levels under the covenants 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in the lending agreements could result in default under such agreements 
in the event of a default  a lender could refuse to make additional advances under the revolving portion of a credit facility  could require the company to repay some or all of its outstanding debt prior to maturity  and or could declare all amounts borrowed by the company  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
in the event that this occurs  the company may be unable to repay all such accelerated indebtedness  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial position and operating performance 
if necessary  the company could use its existing cash balances or attempt to access equity and debt markets or to obtain new financing arrangements with new lenders or investors as alternative funding sources to restructure current debt 
any issuance of new equity could dilute current shareholders 
any new debt financing could be on terms less favorable than those of our existing financing and could subject us to new and additional covenants 
decisions by lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company would depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s historical and projected financial performance  compliance with the terms of its current or future credit agreements  industry and market trends  internal policies of prospective lenders and investors  and the availability of capital 
no assurance can be had that the company would be successful in obtaining funds from alternative sources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   million of our outstanding debt consisted of variable rate borrowings pursuant to a financing agreement with ableco finance llc that has since been terminated 
we also had in place as of december  an amended and restated loan agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc borrowings under these credit facilities accrued interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
we entered into an interest rate swap contract to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on up to million of the wells fargo foothill revolving facility portion of our indebtedness 
due to the minimal outstanding balances outstanding on the credit facility with wells fargo foothill during the year ended december   the interest rate swap was deemed ineffective and resulted in expense of  for the year ended december  the interest rate swap was liquidated in connection with the termination of the wells fargo foothill facility 
the ableco and foothill agreements were replaced by a credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na and other lenders on march  assuming our variable borrowings were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would have a  effect on interest expense and cash flow 
commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous  non ferrous  pgm and lead metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and export markets can be volatile located in this annual report 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly as markets allow instead of holding inventories in anticipation of higher commodity prices 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to hedge against the extremely volatile pgm metal prices 
the company estimates that if selling prices decreased by in any of the business units in which it operates  there would not be a material write down of any of its reported inventory values 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates 
risk from common stock market price we are exposed to risks associated with the market price of our own common stock 
in connection with certain financings  we have issued warrants that can be put to us upon a change of control 
we are required to use the value of our common stock as an input variable to determine the fair value of the liability associated with the put warrants 
fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have an effect on the liability 
for example  if the price of our common stock was higher as of december   the put warrant liability would increase by
