item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data included in item of this annual report on form k  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
industry overview the solid waste industry is a local and highly competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and  to a lesser extent  the quality of service  and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable industry operators are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste  which is bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
executive overview we are an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly secondary markets in the western and southern us we also provide intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the pacific northwest through a network of intermodal facilities 
we seek to avoid highly competitive  large urban markets and instead target markets where we can provide either solid waste services under exclusive arrangements  or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
operating results we reported record revenue  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  and free cash flow in  and invested a record amount in both capital expenditures and acquisitions to further strengthen and expand our business 
revenue in increased to billion from reduced volumes from a difficult economy  declining fuel surcharges and decreased recycled commodity prices drove revenue down in this decline was offset by a increase in revenue from acquisitions and a increase from core price  resulting in the increase in reported revenue 
we experienced a precipitous drop in volumes and recycled commodity prices in the fourth quarter of due to the decline in economic activity across the united states  but believe that our revenue began to stabilize during the second quarter of as shown in the table below  internal growth decreased from positive in  to negative in internal growth for the first three quarters of was negative  but improved to negative in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the stability we believe we attained relative to the declines in the year ago period 
price volume intermodal  recycling and other internal growth 
table of contents the core pricing component of our internal growth increased to in as a result of broad based pricing initiatives primarily designed to offset the lost contribution from year over year decreases in volumes and recycled commodity prices 
decreased surcharges  primarily related to declining fuel costs  were a negative impact to internal growth 
although volume growth was negative for the full year  quarterly volume losses began to improve in the fourth quarter of to compared to quarterly volume losses of in the third quarter of intermodal  recycling and other negatively impacted internal growth by approximately in due to a decline in recycled commodity prices during the first three quarters of the year and reduced intermodal activity 
similar to the previously discussed improving year over year trends in volumes during the fourth quarter of  intermodal  recycling and other improved to a positive contribution to internal growth in the fourth quarter of due to increased recycled commodity prices 
in  operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to operating income  increased to million from as a percentage of revenue  operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets increased from in  to in this percentage point increase was primarily attributable to a decline in fuel costs and higher margin acquisitions  partially offset by an increase in sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to the expensing of acquisition related costs  a charge incurred to write down our prior corporate office lease in connection with the relocation of our corporate office earlier in the year  and increased legal expenses 
the increase in operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets on a dollar and margin basis also reflects our response to the drop in economic activity across the united states 
we reduced headcount more than and instituted a number of wage and cost controls in free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from  and capital expenditures increased to million over that period 
free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities  increased to million in  from million in free cash flow increased as a percentage of revenues to in  from in we believe this strength in our free cash flow reflects the continuing resiliency of our strategy during this difficult economic period 
capital position we target a leverage ratio  as defined in our credit facility  between x and x of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
we deployed million during for acquisitions  million for capital expenditures  and million for common stock repurchases 
these outlays were primarily funded by a combination of operating cash flow during the year and excess cash balances 
as a result  our leverage ratio declined from its december  level  and remained below our targeted range at year end we maintained a strong balance sheet and access to capital throughout this recent recession 
we issued a million aggregate principal amount  year unsecured note at a fixed rate and exited with almost million of available capital under our credit facility to fund additional growth opportunities 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company 
such critical accounting estimates and assumptions are applicable to our reportable segments 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
insurance liabilities 
we maintain insurance policies for automobile  general  employer s  environmental and directors and officers liability as well as for employee group health insurance  property insurance and workers compensation 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 

table of contents income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
if our judgment and estimates concerning assumptions made in calculating our expected future income tax rates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets and liabilities would change 
based on our net deferred tax liability balance at december   each percentage point change to our expected future income tax rate would change our net deferred tax liability balance and income tax expense by approximately million 
accounting for landfills 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of a landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and expansion airspace 
we calculate the net present value of our final capping  closure and post closure commitments by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated undiscounted cash flows are treated as a new liability and are inflated and discounted at rates reflecting current market conditions 
downward revisions or if there are no changes to the estimated undiscounted cash flows are inflated and discounted at rates reflecting the market conditions at the time the cash flows were originally estimated 
this policy results in our final capping  closure and post closure liabilities being recorded in layers 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized to depletion expense as the landfills airspace is consumed 
interest is accreted on the recorded liability using the corresponding discount rate 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with expansion airspace 
expansion airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
we accrue for estimated final capping  closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own  and the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to final capping  closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
at january   we increased our discount rate assumption for purposes of computing layers for final capping  closure and post closure obligations from to  in order to more accurately reflect our long term cost of borrowing as of the end of consistent with the prior year  our inflation rate assumption is 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill final capping  closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we own two landfills for which the prior owners are obligated to reimburse us for certain costs we incur for final capping  closure and post closure activities on the portion of the landfill utilized by the prior owners 
we accrue the prior owner s portion of the final capping  closure and post closure obligation within the balance sheet classification of other long term liabilities  and a corresponding receivable from the prior owner in long term other assets 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and expansion airspace  at the landfills that we own and at the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the term of the operating agreement at our operated landfills that have capitalized expenditures 
expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of expansion that is not actually permitted 
expansion airspace that meets certain internal criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
the internal criteria we use to determine when expansion airspace may be included as disposal capacity are as follows the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and we either own the expansion property or it is under an option  purchase  operating or other similar agreement  total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  
table of contents internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  internal personnel or external consultants are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  and we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business or political restrictions or similar issues existing that could impair the success of the expansion 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for expansion disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such cases  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible testing 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
in testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of each indefinite lived intangible to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible is less than its carrying value  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole and each indefinite lived intangible asset  we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit and the future discrete cash flows related to each indefinite lived intangible asset 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses were based on ten year financial forecasts  which in turn were based on the annual budget developed internally by management 
these forecasts reflect perpetual revenue growth rates of and operating profit margins that were consistent with results 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment test in however  there can be no assurance that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will not be impaired at any time in the future 
business combination accounting 
we recognize  separately from goodwill  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values 
we measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of a the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred  the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree if any and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any  over b the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either paid or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
one method we use to estimate the fair value of solid waste companies is based on a multiple of ebitda 
we determine the appropriate ebitda multiple to be used in the valuation of exchange transactions based on factors such as the size of the transaction  the type and location of markets serviced  the existence of long term contracts and the ebitda multiples we have paid in other similar cash based transactions 
general our solid waste revenues are derived from one industry segment  which consist mainly of fees we charge customers for collection  transfer  recycling and disposal of non hazardous solid waste 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing residential  commercial and industrial services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and most of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer station and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices of our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
our revenues from intermodal services consist mainly of fees we charge customers for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers between our intermodal facilities 
we also generate revenue from the storage  maintenance and repair of cargo and solid waste containers and the sale or lease of containers and chassis 
no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our total revenues at the consolidated or reportable segment level during the periods presented 
the table below shows for the periods indicated our total reported revenues attributable to services provided dollars in thousands 
years ended december  collection disposal and transfer intermodal  recycling and other less intercompany elimination total revenue cost of operations includes labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  vehicle and equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment insurance  insurance and employee group health claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our significant costs of operations in were labor  third party disposal and transportation  vehicle and equipment maintenance  taxes and fees  insurance and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workers compensation exposure  utilizing comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
we carry high deductible insurance for automobile liability  property  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability and employer group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 

table of contents selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  acquisition  bad debt expense and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of equipment and fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and expansion airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of definite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense all third party and indirect acquisition costs  including third party legal and engineering expenses  executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
at december   we had million in capitalized expenditures for a landfill project in chaparral  new mexico  with respect to which we had obtained a permit to operate the landfill 
on july   the supreme court of new mexico ordered the new mexico environment department to conduct an additional limited hearing to consider evidence that landfill opponents claim was wrongfully excluded 
the parties have agreed to postpone the hearing until november at the earliest to allow us time to explore a possible relocation of the landfill to the approximately acres of undeveloped land we purchased from the state of new mexico in july if we are not ultimately issued a permit to operate the landfill  we will be required to expense in a future period the capitalized expenditures for this project  less the recoverable value of the applicable property and any other amounts recovered  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations for that period 
segment reporting our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and determines resource allocations based on several factors  of which the primary financial measure is operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets 
operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
our management uses operating income loss before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets in the evaluation of segment operating performance as it is a profit measure that is generally within the control of the operating segments 
we manage our operations through three geographic operating segments western  central and southern  which  commencing in  are also our reportable segments 
prior to  we aggregated our multiple operating segments into one reportable segment 
each segment is responsible for managing several vertically integrated operations  which are comprised of districts 
the segment information presented herein reflects the realignment of our organizational structure in the second quarter of  which reduced the number of our geographic operating segments from four to three

volume decreases in our existing business during the year ended december   reduced revenues by approximately million 
the net decrease in volume was primarily attributable to declines in roll off activity and landfill and transfer station volumes for operations owned in the comparable periods as a result of the economic recession currently affecting the united states 
lower recyclable commodity prices during the initial nine months of  primarily a result of decreased overseas demand for recyclable commodities  partially offset by improved commodity pricing during the final three months of  resulted in a net decrease to revenues of million during the year ended december  during the nine months ended september   the decrease in recyclable revenues from price declines was million 
commodity price improvements during the three months ended december  increased revenues by million 
other revenues decreased by million during the year ended december   primarily due to a decline in cargo volume at our intermodal operations 
cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to operating costs associated with acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   increased landfill operating and leachate disposal costs at certain landfills we own and an increase in auto and workers compensation expense under our high deductible insurance program due to a larger reduction in projected losses on open claims in compared to  partially offset by decreased labor expenses due to headcount reductions at our operations owned in the comparable periods  decreased employee medical benefit expenses resulting from decreases in claims cost  decreased diesel fuel expense resulting from lower volumes consumed and lower prices  decreased major vehicle and equipment repairs  decreased disposal and third party trucking and transportation expenses due to decreased volumes and decreased expenses associated with the cost of purchasing recyclable commodities due to recyclable commodity pricing declines 
we record adjustments to auto and workers compensation claim development costs based on changes in estimates of actuarially projected losses on open claims determined by our third party administrator s review and a third party actuarial review of our estimated insurance liability 
during the years ended december  and  adjustments recorded resulting from changes in estimates of actuarially projected losses on open claims resulted in reductions to insurance expense of million and million  respectively  which partially offset the overall increase in insurance expense discussed above 

table of contents cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices  decreased third party trucking and transportation expenses and decreases in the cost of recyclable commodities  partially offset by increased auto and workers compensation expense and increased landfill leachate disposal expenses

years ended december  operating income plus depreciation plus amortization of intangibles loss gain on disposal of assets operating income before depreciation  amortization and gain loss on disposal of assets 
table of contents inflation other than volatility in fuel prices  inflation has not materially affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business 
however  competitive pressures or delays in the timing of rate increases under our contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  especially if cost increases exceed the average rate of inflation 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and prices of certain commodities 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates and fuel prices 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses over the unhedged fuel and variable rate debt positions 
at december   our derivative instruments included five interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows dollars in thousands fixed variable notional interest interest rate date entered amount rate paid received effective date expiration date november  month libor february february november  month libor february february november  month libor february february november  month libor june june march  month libor february february plus applicable margin 
under derivatives and hedging guidance  all the interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt  and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
on october   we terminated two of our interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with issuing our notes 
we terminated an interest rate swap in the amount of million that would have expired in march and an interest rate swap in the amount of million that would have expired in june as a result of terminating these interest rate swaps  we made a cash payment of million to the counterparty of the swap agreements 
further  because we used the proceeds of the notes to reduce the borrowings under our senior uncollateralized revolving credit facility  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transactions that were being hedged by these interest rate swap agreements will occur 
therefore  we recorded a charge of million to other expense in the fourth quarter of we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged floating rate debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the unhedged floating rate balances owed at december  and  of million and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility and floating rate municipal bond obligations 
a one percent increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million and million  respectively 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations  subject to counterparty default risk 
the market price of diesel fuel is unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly 
we purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel per year  therefore  a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins 
to manage a portion of this risk  in  we entered into multiple fuel hedge agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases 

table of contents at december   our derivative instruments included nine fuel hedge agreements as follows diesel rate paid notional amount fixed in gallons per per diesel rate received effective expiration date entered month gallon variable date date october  doe diesel fuel index january december october  doe diesel fuel index january december october  doe diesel fuel index january december december  doe diesel fuel index january december december  doe diesel fuel index january december december  doe diesel fuel index january december december  doe diesel fuel index january december december  doe diesel fuel index january december december  doe diesel fuel index january december if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price  as published by the department of energy  exceeds the contract price per gallon  we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional gallons from the counterparty 
if the average price is less than the contract price per gallon  we pay the difference to the counterparty 
under derivatives and hedging guidance  all the fuel hedges are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our forecasted diesel fuel purchases  and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
additionally  in we entered into multiple fixed price fuel purchase contracts related to fuel that we will purchase in for a total of million gallons of diesel fuel and a total unconditional purchase obligation of million  plus taxes and transportation upon delivery 
these fixed price fuel purchase contracts expire on or before june  we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged diesel fuel purchases 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
for the year ending december   we expect to purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel  of which million gallons will be purchased at market prices  million gallons will be purchased at prices that are fixed under our fuel hedges  and million gallons will be purchased under our fixed price fuel purchase contracts 
with respect to the approximately million gallons of unhedged diesel fuel we expect to purchase in at market prices  a per gallon increase in the price of fuel over the year would decrease our pre tax income during this period by approximately million 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
certain of our municipal recycling contracts in the state of washington specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
in the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices  a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the average prices that were in effect during the years ended december  and  would have had a million and million impact on revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively
