item a 
risk factors 
an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd s business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
current economic conditions could adversely affect our operations 
the current economic conditions may result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
during fiscal year  lower laboratory testing volumes and physician visits in the united states and macroeconomic factors in western europe contributed to weakened demand for our products 
any austerity plans implemented in europe or other regions where governments are the primary payers of healthcare expenses and research may also result in a decrease in demand for our products 
in addition  while the current economic conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date  there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future 
the current economic conditions may adversely affect our suppliers  and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future 
the increase in sovereign debt during the financial crisis as a result of governmental intervention in the world economy poses additional risks to the global financial system and economic recovery 
we have experienced delays in collecting receivables in greece due to the greek government s liquidity problems 
we may experience similar delays in other jurisdictions experiencing liquidity problems 
the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the economic downturn will not continue to affect our operations in the future 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
over half of our fiscal year revenues were derived from international operations 
our revenues outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 
 management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
any hedging activities in which we may engage only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 
federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 
the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was enacted in march under the ppaca  beginning in  medical device manufacturers  such as bd  will pay a excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices 
sales of bd products that we estimate to be subject to this tax represented about of bd s total us revenues in fiscal year we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business 
the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals  clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies  and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures 
these factors  in turn  could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure 
it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements 
table of contents for our products 
while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states  the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd s products is uncertain at this time 
changes in reimbursement practices of third party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 
our sales depend  in part  on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities  private insurers and other third party payers for the costs of our products 
the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third party payers  which can vary among public and private sources  may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction 
legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of the ppaca or abroad for example  those under consideration in france  germany  italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products  or result in denial of reimbursement for those products 
see third party reimbursement under item business 
price volatility could adversely affect costs associated with our operations 
our results of operations could be negatively impacted by price volatility in the cost of raw materials  components  freight and energy 
in particular  bd purchases supplies of resins  which are oil based components used in the manufacture of certain products 
any significant increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results 
increases in the price of oil can also increase bd s costs for packaging and transportation 
new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components 
these cost increases may adversely affect our profitability 
bd s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products  and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 
a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers 
the development of these products requires significant research and development  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors  including bd s ability to innovate  develop and manufacture new products  complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad  or gain and maintain market approval of our products 
in addition  patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product 
there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approval  or gain market acceptance 
the medical technology industry is very competitive 
the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes  and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold 
we face this competition from a wide range of companies 
these include large medical device companies  some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets 
other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well 
in some instances  competitors  including pharmaceutical companies  also offer  or are attempting to develop  alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device 
the development of new or improved products  processes or technologies by other companies such as needle free injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
in addition  increasing customer demand for more environmentally friendly products is creating another basis on which bd must compete 
the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other low cost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing pressures  particularly in developing markets 
some competitors have also 
table of contents established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 
new entrants may also appear  particularly from these low cost countries 
a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd s manufacturing operations and related product sales 
bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components 
certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources 
in addition  for quality assurance  cost effectiveness and other reasons  bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers 
the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons  including current economic conditions as described above 
while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
in addition  where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers  we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis 
the termination  reduction or interruption in supply of these sole sourced raw materials and components could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
we have manufacturing sites all over the world 
in addition  in some instances  the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants 
as a result  weather  natural disasters including pandemics  terrorism  political change  failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures  equipment malfunction  environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 
bd is subject to a number of pending lawsuits 
bd is a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits  including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and product liability  and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future 
a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item legal proceedings 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party 
in view of these uncertainties  we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance 
any such future charges  individually or in the aggregate  could adversely affect bd s results of operations and cash flows 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased 
in addition  group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers  which has placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers 
further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 
product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 
the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks 
manufacturing or design defects  unanticipated use of our products  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events 
these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries  and could result  in certain cases  in the removal of a product from the market 
a recall could result in significant costs  as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 
personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims 
table of contents being brought against us 
in some circumstances  such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 
we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records  record transactions  provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements 
the design and implementation of the new erp system has required  and will continue to require  the investment of significant financial and human resources 
the total cost needed to implement the new erp system may turn out to be more than we currently anticipate 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully implement the new erp system without experiencing difficulties 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders  ship products  provide services and customer support  send invoices and track payments  fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 
bd is subject to extensive regulation 
bd is subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  by comparable agencies in foreign countries  and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies 
most of bd s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or non us counterpart regulatory agencies before they can be marketed or sold 
the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and these may be increasing 
the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products 
also  governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding registration  labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or re register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products 
in addition  once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product  there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 
following the introduction of a product  these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance 
our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices  adverse event reporting  clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production  marketing or sale of our products and result in fines  delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances  closure of manufacturing sites  seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation 
recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity  which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 
we cannot guarantee that any of bd s strategic acquisitions  investments or alliances will be successful 
while our strategy to increase revenue growth is driven primarily by internal product development  we seek to supplement our growth through strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances 
such transactions are inherently risky 
the success of any acquisition  investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors  including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate it into our existing business 
there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 
the international operations of bd s business may subject bd to certain business risks 
bd operations outside the united states subject bd to certain risks  including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange as discussed above  the spread of a global economic downturn  changes in foreign regulatory requirements  local product preferences  difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing foreign operations  differing labor regulations  changes in tax laws  potential political instability  trade barriers  weakening of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders 
the success of our operations outside the united states will depend  in part  on our 
table of contents ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to  among other things  our production facilities and distribution networks 
reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 
our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  government laboratories and private foundations 
research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions 
a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies  such as the us national institutes of health nih and agencies in other countries 
the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable 
there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods 
the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic downturn 
any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 
our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 
many of bd s businesses rely on patent  trademark and other intellectual property assets 
while we do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other intellectual property asset would materially adversely affect bd operations  these intellectual property assets  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations  legal challenges or governmental action 
patents attained by competitors  particularly as patents on our products expire  may also adversely affect our competitive position 
the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings  financial condition or cash flows 
in addition  competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property 
resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and time consuming 
natural disasters  war and other events could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
natural disasters including pandemics  war  terrorism  labor disruptions and international conflicts  and actions taken by the united states and other governments in response to such events  could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate 
these events could result in decreased demand for our products  adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities  or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 
we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees  including people in technical  marketing  sales and research positions 
competition for experienced employees  particularly for persons with specialized skills  can be intense 
bd s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors  including compensation and benefits  work location and work environment 
if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees  our business could be adversely affected
