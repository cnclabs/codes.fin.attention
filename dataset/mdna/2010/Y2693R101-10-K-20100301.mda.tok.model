item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following is a discussion of our financial condition at december  and and our results of operations comparing the years ended december  and and the years ended december  and you should read this section together with the consolidated financial statements including the notes to those financial statements for the years mentioned above 
we are a leading provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services 
we also provide transportation services for refined petroleum  products 
as of december   our fleet consisted of vessels aframax vessels  suezmax vessels  two vlccs  two panamax vessels and four handymax vessels with a total cargo carrying capacity of million deadweight tons 
general maritime subsidiary is the predecessor of the company for purposes of us securities regulations governing financial statement filing 
the arlington acquisition is accounted for as an acquisition by general maritime subsidiary of arlington 
therefore  the disclosures throughout this annual report on form k and the accompanying consolidated financial statements  unless otherwise noted  reflect the results of operations of general maritime subsidiary for period january  through december  and the years ended december  and and the financial position of general maritime subsidiary as of december  the company had separate operations for the period beginning december   the effective date of the arlington acquisition  and disclosures and references to amounts for periods after that date relate to the company unless otherwise noted 
arlington s results have been included in the disclosures throughout this annual report on form k and the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  unless otherwise noted  from the effective date of acquisition and thereafter see arlington acquisition in note to the consolidated financial statements 
all share and per share amounts presented throughout this annual report on form k  unless otherwise noted  have been adjusted to reflect the exchange of shares of our common stock for each share of common stock held by shareholders of general maritime subsidiary in connection with the arlington acquisition 
spot and time charter deployment we actively manage the deployment of our fleet between spot market voyage charters  which generally last from several days to several weeks  and time charters  which can last up to several years 
a spot market voyage charter is generally a contract to carry a specific cargo from a load port to a discharge port for an agreed upon total amount 
under spot market voyage charters  we pay voyage expenses such as port  canal and fuel costs 
a time charter is generally a contract to charter a vessel for a fixed period of time at a set daily rate 
under time charters  the charterer pays voyage expenses such as port  canal and fuel costs 
vessels operating on time charters provide more predictable cash flows  but can yield lower profit margins than vessels operating in the spot market during periods characterized by favorable market conditions 
vessels operating in the spot market generate revenues that are less predictable but may enable us to capture increased profit margins during periods of improvements in tanker rates although we are exposed to the risk of declining tanker rates 
we are constantly evaluating opportunities to increase the number of our vessels deployed on time charters  but only expect to enter into additional time charters if we can obtain contract terms that satisfy our criteria 
net voyage revenues as performance measure for discussion and analysis purposes only  we evaluate performance using net voyage revenues 
net voyage revenues are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses 
voyage expenses primarily consist of port  canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage  which would otherwise be paid by a charterer under a time charter 
we believe that presenting voyage revenues  net of voyage expenses  neutralizes the variability created by unique costs associated with particular voyages or the deployment of vessels on time charter or on the spot market and presents a more accurate representation of the revenues generated by our vessels 
our voyage revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the spot market voyages and the lives of the charters  while direct vessel expenses are recognized when incurred 
we recognize the revenues of time charters that contain rate escalation schedules at the average rate during the life of the contract 
we calculate time charter equivalent  or tce  rates by dividing net voyage revenue by voyage days for the relevant time period 
we also generate demurrage revenue  which represents fees charged to charterers associated with our spot market voyages when the charterer exceeds the agreed upon time required to load or discharge a cargo 
we calculate daily direct vessel operating expenses and daily general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by dividing the total expenses by the aggregate number of calendar days that we owned each vessel for the period 
results of operations margin analysis for the indicated items as a percentage of net voyage revenues for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below 
income statement margin analysis of net voyage revenues year ended december  income statement data net voyage revenues direct vessel expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment loss on disposal of vessel equipment operating income net interest expense other income expense net loss income income statement data year ended december  dollars in thousands  except share data voyage revenues voyage expenses net voyage revenues year ended december  compared to the year ended december  voyage revenues voyage revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in the size of our fleet  which increased vessel operating days by to  days during the year ended december  compared to  days in the prior year 
the average size of our fleet increased by to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax for the prior year 
this increase in fleet size is attributable to the completion of construction of a suezmax tanker in february  the acquisitions during the fourth quarter of of two aframax vessels  and the acquisition of two vlccs  two panamaxes  and four handymaxes as part of the arlington acquisition 
also  included in this increase in voyage revenues is million associated with the acceleration of the amortization of a net liability associated with four time charter contracts 
these contracts were recorded as a liability when the vessels to which the time charters relate were acquired by the company pursuant to the arlington acquisition 
this recorded liability was being amortized over the remaining time charter period  including the option periods 
the company accelerated the amortization on four of these time charters  having been informed by the charterer that the options would not be exercised 
accordingly  the company accelerated the amortization on these contracts such that the net liability would be fully amortized by the earlier of november  the end of the charter period or the redelivery date indicated by the charterer on two of the vessels 
this additional revenue is nonrecurring and was noncash 
this increase is partially offset by a significant reduction in rates  especially with respect to vessels under spot voyage and  to a lesser extent time charters  as well as decreased utilization rates relating to drydocking and repositioning of vessels  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
voyage revenues are expected to remain relatively flat during as compared to decreases associated with expected lower spot rates during as compared to are expected to be offset by a greater number of vessels expected to be on the spot market during compared to because spot voyage charters require the vessel owner to pay voyage related expenses such as fuel and port costs  which costs are borne by the charterer under a time charter contract  spot voyage charters typically earn significantly higher revenues to recoup these expenses 
in addition  million of voyage revenue recognized in associated with the acceleration of a net liability associated with four time charter contracts described above will not recur in voyage expenses voyage expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages  under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs 
this increase in voyage expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters 
during the year ended december   the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters increased by to  days  days for our aframax vessels  days for our suezmax vessels  days for our vlccs  and days for our panamax vessels from  days  days for our aframax vessels and days for our suezmax vessels  the only vessels on spot charter during during the prior year 
this increase is partially offset by lower fuel cost incurred during although this increase in spot vessel days increased fuel cost by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year  fuel cost per spot voyage day decreased during the year ended december  compared to the prior year period as a result of lower bunker fuel prices 
voyage expenses are expected to increase during as compared to as a result of a greater number of vessels expected to be on the spot market during compared to under spot voyage charters  the vessel owner pays for the voyage expenses 
net voyage revenues net voyage revenues  which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the average size of our fleet  which increased to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax vessel for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax vessel for the prior year 
partially offsetting this increase in net voyage revenue are significantly weaker overall daily tce rates for our vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our average tce rates decreased to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this decrease reflects a significant decline in spot charter tce rates which decreased to  during the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
partially offsetting this decrease in overall spot rates is million of voyage revenue associated with the acceleration of the amortization of a net liability associated with four time charter contracts 
these contracts were assigned a liability when the vessels to which the time charters relate were acquired by the company pursuant to the arlington acquisition 
this additional revenue  which is nonrecurring and noncash  had the effect of increasing decreasing time charter tce on vlccs  panamaxes and handymaxes by   and  respectively 
this million of voyage revenue also had the effect of increasing combined overall time charter tce and overall tce and by  and  respectively 
net voyage revenues are expected to decrease during compared to for reasons discussed above relating to voyage revenues and voyage expenses 
the following is additional data pertaining to net voyage revenues year ended december  increase decrease change net voyage revenue in thousands time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a panamax a handymax a total spot charter aframax suezmax vlcc n a panamax n a total total net voyage revenue vessel operating days time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a panamax a handymax a total spot charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a panamax a n a total total vessel operating days average number of vessels time charter equivalent tce time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a panamax a handymax a combined spot charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a panamax a n a combined total tce a acquired on december  as of december   of our vessels were on time charters expiring between january and july direct vessel expenses direct vessel expenses  which include crew costs  provisions  deck and engine stores  lubricating oil  insurance  maintenance and repairs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in the average size of our fleet which increased to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax for the prior year 
in addition  daily direct vessel expenses for our vlccs increased in part during because our two vlccs were redelivered from a fixed fee technical management agreements with northern marine during october and replaced with technical management agreements with northern marine that were based on actual costs which were significantly higher than the previous fixed fee 
this contributed to a rise in daily direct vessel expenses per vessel which increased by  or  to   aframax   suezmax   vlcc   panamax   handymax for the year ended december  compared to   aframax   suezmax   vlcc   panamax   handymax for the prior year 
factors contributing to this increase in overall and daily direct vessel expenses include higher crewing costs on the aframax and suezmax vessels relating to wage increases given to crews commencing during the second half of and the beginning of  higher repair costs during the year ended december  associated with significant repairs such as main and auxiliary engines on certain aframax vessels and increases in insurance costs during the year ended december  on the aframax fleet relating to increased premiums as well as the write off of certain claims not deemed to be collectible 
partially offsetting this increase in overall as well as daily direct vessel expenses is a reduction in insurance related costs on our suezmax fleet pertaining to an expense of million during relating to a general average claim associated with a suezmax vessel which did not recur in we anticipate that direct vessel expenses will decrease to million during based on daily budgeted direct vessel expenses on our suezmax vessels  aframax vessels  two vlccs  two panamax vessels and four handymax vessels of     and  respectively 
the budgets for the aframax and suezmax vessels are based on actual results adjusted for certain events not expected to recur or anticipated events which did not occur in this decrease primarily reflects unanticipated repairs on our aframax vessels made during that are not expected to recur in the budgeted amounts include no provisions for unanticipated repair or other costs 
we cannot assure you that our budgeted amounts will reflect our actual results 
unanticipated repair or other costs may cause our actual expenses to be materially higher than those budgeted 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
significant factors contributing to this decrease for the year ended december  compared to the prior year are a a million decrease during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year relating to compensation accruals in connection with our executive transition plan incurred in  relating to amounts due to peter c 
georgiopoulos in connection with the termination of his employment arrangments with the company 
b an million decrease during the year ended december  associated with a payment in lieu of a bonus payable to peter georgiopoulos during the year ended december  c an aggregate decrease of million during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year comprised of a million decrease in salaries due to reduced head count in the company s new york office  a million decrease in restricted stock amortization associated with fewer shares granted at the end of compared to the end of and million reduction in cash bonuses incurred during compared to d a million decrease during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year associated with costs incurred during the year ended december  relating to fines and costs deemed to be uncollectible from insurers relating to a conviction in a criminal proceeding involving the genmar defiance 
e a million decrease during the year ended december  compared to the prior year associated with ceasing the operation of our corporate aircraft  which we leased through february general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net voyage revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
daily general and administrative expenses per vessel decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
for  we have budgeted general and administrative expenses to be approximately million 
we cannot assure you that our budgeted amounts will reflect our actual results 
unanticipated costs may cause our actual expenses to be materially higher than those budgeted 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  which include depreciation of vessels as well as amortization of drydocking and special surveys  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
vessel depreciation increased by million  or  to million during year ended december  compared to million during the prior year period 
this increase is due to increased depreciation during relating to the additions to our fleet of the genmar st 
nikolas in february  the genmar elektra in october  the genmar daphne in december  and the eight vessels we acquired in the arlington acquisition in december amortization of drydocking increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
drydocks are typically amortized over periods from months to months 
this increase reflects amortization during of a portion of the million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended december  and amortization for the full year of the million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended december  the effect of these additions to drydock amortization expense was offset by a reduction in drydock costs incurred during resulting from vessels drydocked at the end of the year 
depreciation of vessel equipment increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase relates to a greater amount of equipment being capitalized to vessels during as compared to the prior year 
as of december  and  vessel equipment was million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization is expected to increase during as the additions made during the year ended december  to drydocking and vessel equipment are amortized and depreciated for a full year 
goodwill impairment for the year ended december   we recorded goodwill impairment of million 
there was no goodwill impairment during refer to the goodwill section in critical accounting policies 
loss gain on disposal vessel equipment during the years ended december  and  we incurred losses of million and million  respectively  associated with the disposal of certain vessel equipment 
interest income interest income decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
this decrease is the result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates on deposits during compared to interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is attributable to the issuance of million of senior notes on november  at a coupon interest rate of and an increase of margin over libor under our credit facility from basis points to basis points pursuant to an amendment to the credit facility on that same date 
in addition  the million rbs facility acquired in connection with the arlington acquisition on december  was outstanding until its retirement on november  during the year ended december   our weighted average outstanding debt increased by to million compared to million during the prior year 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates on our floating rate debt during compared to we expect our long term debt during to approximate our debt level at december  however  due to the current composition of our debt consisting of million of senior notes at a fixed rate of and million of floating rate debt under our credit facility bearing a margin over libor of basis points  we expect our interest expense to increase significantly during due to higher interest rates on our debt 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was million and is primarily attributable to a million recovery from a insurance claim 
partially offsetting this other income is a million write off associated with a drydock related asset on two vessels for which their technical management agreements with northern marine terminated prior to the consummation of drydockings 
this amount relates to the estimated excess of the cost the company would have incurred to procure the drydocks itself over the amount it would have paid northern marine to perform the drydock had the contracts not been terminated 
other income for the year ended december  also reflects a realized gain on our freight derivative of million and million of unrealized loss on our freight derivative  a realized loss of million associated with our interest rate swaps  and a million unrealized gain on a bunker derivative 
offsetting this income is an unrealized loss during the year ended december  of approximately million associated with foreign currency transaction losses 
other expense for the year ended december  was million which included an aggregate realized loss on our freight derivatives of million partially offset by an unrealized gain on our freight derivatives of million 
net loss income net loss was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the prior year 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  voyage revenues voyage revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase reflects a increase in vessel operating days  reflecting in part an increased utilization rate for our vessels  as well as increases in rates attained during for our vessels under time charter and spot charter as compared to the prior year 
included in this percentage increase is operating days for the two vlccs  two panamaxes  and four handymax vessels we acquired on december  pursuant to our merger with arlington 
an additional operating days during relates to our purchase of two aframax vessels during voyage expenses voyage expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase in voyage expenses is primarily attributable to higher fuel costs incurred during fuel costs increased by per spot voyage day during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
substantially all of our voyage expenses relate to spot charter voyages  under which the vessel owner is responsible for voyage expenses such as fuel and port costs 
during the year ended december   the number of days our vessels operated under spot charters decreased by to  days  days for our aframax vessels and days for our suezmax vessels from  days  days for our aframax vessels and days for our suezmax vessels during the prior year 
net voyage revenues net voyage revenues  which are voyage revenues minus voyage expenses  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
of this total increase  approximately million is attributable to the increase in the average size of our fleet which increased to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  handymax vessel for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in net voyage revenue is associated with stronger overall daily tce rates for suezmax and aframax vessels during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our average tce rates increased to  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the following is additional data pertaining to net voyage revenues year ended december  increase decrease change net voyage revenue in thousands time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a panamax a n a product a n a total spot charter aframax suezmax total total net voyage revenue vessel operating days time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a panamax a n a product a n a total spot charter aframax suezmax total total vessel operating days average number of vessels time charter equivalent tce time charter aframax suezmax vlcc a n a n a panamax a n a n a product a n a n a combined spot charter aframax suezmax combined total tce a acquired on december  as of december   of our vessels are on time charters expiring between july and july direct vessel expenses direct vessel expenses  which include crew costs  provisions  deck and engine stores  lubricating oil  insurance  maintenance and repairs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
we incurred higher crewing costs during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period which reflects higher crew wages in due in part to exchange rates on a substantially higher portion of crew wages paid in euros during the period as compared to the prior year period  as well as additional wage increases given to crews commencing during the second half of this increase is also associated with higher repair costs during the year ended december  associated with significant repairs including fuel consumed during the repair period on four of the our suezmax vessels  as well as additional expenses of spare parts purchases and their delivery costs and costs associated with tank cleaning of several vessels pursuant to tank inspections required by charterers during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
lubricating costs were also higher during the year ended december  compared to the prior year associated with higher petroleum product costs 
in addition  we recognized an expense of million during the period relating to a general average claim associated with a suezmax vessel 
these factors contributed to a rise in daily direct vessel expenses per vessel which increased by  or  to   aframax   suezmax   vlcc   panamax   product for the year ended december  compared to   aframax   suezmax for the prior year 
also contributing to the overall increase in direct vessel expense is an increase in the average size of our fleet which increased to vessels aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax  product for the year ended december  compared to vessels aframax  suezmax for the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year

vessel depreciation increased by million to million during year ended december  compared to million during the prior year period 
this increase is due to increased depreciation during relating to the additions to our fleet of the genmar st 
nikolas in february  the genmar elektra in october  the genmar daphne in december  and the eight arlington vessels we acquired in the arlington acquisition in december amortization of drydocking increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
drydocks are typically amortized over periods from months to months 
this increase reflects amortization during of a portion of the million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended december  and amortization for the full year of the million of drydock costs capitalized during the year ended december  loss gain on sale of vessels and equipment during the years ended december  and  we incurred losses of million and million  respectively  associated with the disposal of certain vessel equipment 
interest income interest income decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates on deposits during compared to interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is attributable to the increase in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility during and the addition of the rbs facility in december during the year ended december   our weighted average outstanding debt increased by to million compared to million during the prior year 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest rates during compared to on our floating rate debt 
other expense other expense for the year ended december  was million which included an aggregate realized loss on our freight derivatives of million partially offset by an unrealized gain on our freight derivatives of million 
other expense for the year ended december  was million which is comprised primarily of an aggregate realized loss on our freight derivatives of million and an unrealized loss on our freight derivatives of million 
net income net income was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the prior year 
effects of inflation we do not consider inflation to be a significant risk to the cost of doing business in the current or foreseeable future 
inflation has a moderate impact on operating expenses  drydocking expenses and corporate overhead 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds  cash management since our formation  our principal sources of funds have been equity financings  issuance of long term debt securities  operating cash flows  long term bank borrowings and opportunistic sales of our older vessels 
our principal use of funds has been capital expenditures to establish and grow our fleet  maintain the quality of our vessels  comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations  fund working capital requirements and repayments on outstanding loan facilities 
beginning in  general maritime subsidiary and subsequently the company also adopted policies to use funds to pay dividends and  from time to time  to repurchase our common stock 
see below for descriptions of our dividend policy and our share repurchase program 
our practice has been to acquire vessels or newbuilding contracts using a combination of funds received from equity investors  bank debt secured by mortgages on our vessels and shares of the common stock of our shipowning subsidiaries  and long term debt securities 
because our payment of dividends is expected to decrease our available cash  while we expect to use our operating cash flows and borrowings to fund acquisitions  if any  on a short term basis  we also intend to review debt and equity financing alternatives to fund such acquisitions 
our business is capital intensive and its future success will depend on our ability to maintain a high quality fleet through the acquisition of newer vessels and the selective sale of older vessels 
these acquisitions will be principally subject to management s expectation of future market conditions as well as our ability to acquire vessels on favorable terms 
because the arlington acquisition was structured as a stock for stock combination  we funded the acquisition of arlington through an issuance of shares in exchange for the shares of the post combination arlington entities 
we expect to rely on operating cash flows as well as long term borrowings and future equity offerings to fund our operations and implement our growth plan and dividend policy 
we believe that our current cash balance as well as operating cash flows and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next year

the company agreed with the lenders on which additional vessels may be pledged as additional collateral under the credit facility 
pursuant to this amendment  the credit facility was amended to  among other things reduce the commitment under the credit facility to million  the result of which is that the next scheduled reduction in total commitment will be april  amend the net debt to ebitda maintenance covenant to increase the permitted ratio to to and including september   to from december  until september  and to thereafter 
amend the collateral vessel appraisal reporting from annually to semi annually and require the company to provide a collateral vessel appraisal report dated within days of the delivery date thereof 
restrict the company s quarterly dividends to no more than per share 
increase the applicable interest rate margin over libor to basis points from basis points and the commitment fee to basis points from basis points 
permit subsidiary guarantees in a qualified notes offering and obligate the company to deliver guarantees to the lenders for all subsidiaries that guarantee the notes issued in a qualified notes offering 
on december   the company entered into an amendment with the lenders under the credit facility clarifying certain provisions 
on december   four additional vessels were pledged to the lenders 
under the credit facility  as amended and restated  the company is permitted to pay quarterly cash dividends limited to per share 
the credit facility  as amended and restated  currently provides semiannual reductions of million commencing on april  and a bullet reduction of million on october  up to million of the credit facility is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit to support obligations of the company and its subsidiaries that are reasonably acceptable to the issuing lenders under the credit facility 
as of december   the company has outstanding letters of credit aggregating million which expire between march and december  leaving million available to be issued 
under the credit facility  as amended and restated  the company is not permitted to reduce the sum of a unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus b the lesser of the total available unutilized commitment and million  to be less than million

the credit facility  as amended and restated  carries an interest rate of libor plus basis points on the outstanding portion and a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion 
as of december   million of the facility is outstanding 
the credit facility is secured by of the company s double hull vessels with an aggregate carrying value as of december  of million  as well as the company s equity interests in its subsidiaries that own these assets  insurance proceeds of the collateralized vessels  and certain deposit accounts related to the vessels 
the credit facility requires us to comply with a collateral maintenance covenant under which the aggregate fair value of these vessels must remain at or above of the total commitment amount under the credit facility and to provide collateral vessel appraisal reports semi annually 
we estimate that the aggregate fair value of such vessels  as determined by valuations received on november   was million as of december   and that a reduction in such fair value would have the effect of reducing the total commitment amount to million 
each subsidiary of the company with an ownership interest in these vessels provides an unconditional guaranty of amounts owing under the credit facility 
the company also provides a guarantee and has pledged its equity interests in general maritime subsidiary 
the company s ability to borrow amounts under the credit facility is subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent  and compliance with terms and conditions contained in the credit documents 
these covenants include  among other things  customary restrictions on the company s ability to incur indebtedness or grant liens  pay dividends or make stock repurchases except as otherwise permitted as described above  engage in businesses other than those engaged in on the effective date of the credit facility  as amended and restated  and similar or related businesses  enter into transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate  or dispose of assets 
the company is also required to comply with various financial covenants  including with respect to the company s minimum cash balance  collateral maintenance  and net debt to ebitda ratio 
the amended and restated credit agreement defines ebitda as net income before net interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash management incentive compensation  as amended and restated 
if the company does not comply with the various financial and other covenants and requirements of the credit facility  as amended and restated  the lenders may  subject to various customary cure rights  require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the facility

the rbs facility with the royal bank of scotland the rbs swap was to mature on january  borrowings under the rbs facility bore interest at libor plus a margin of basis points 
in connection with the rbs facility  the company is party to an interest rate swap agreement with the royal bank of scotland 
the rbs swap was de designated as a hedge as of november  because the company did not have sufficient floating rate debt outstanding set at month libor subsequent to the repayment of the rbs facility against which this swap s notional principal amount of million could be designated 
as of december   the company rolled over at month libor all of its million outstanding balance on its credit facility and the rbs swap was re designated for hedge accounting against this debt 
this interest rate swap remains outstanding as of december  and is described below

of this deposit  million is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the balance of million is included in other assets 
interest expense pertaining to interest rate swaps for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company would have paid a net amount of approximately million to settle its outstanding swap agreement based upon its aggregate fair value as of december  this fair value is based upon estimates received from financial institutions 
cash and working capital cash decreased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  working capital is current assets minus current liabilities  including the current portion of long term debt 
working capital was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the current portion of long term debt included in our current liabilities was as of december  and cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities of million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of million for the prior year  a decrease in deferred voyage revenue of approximately million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of million during the prior year  and an increase in drydocking costs incurred  which were million during the year ended december  compared to million during the prior year 
net loss income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
partially offsetting this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and factoring are increases for the year ended december  compared to the prior year of million and million in depreciation and amortization and goodwill impairment  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to components of net income that had not been paid as of december  such as the million in compensation accruals in connection with the company s executive transition plan  which is included in the increase in accrued expenses as of december  as compared to the prior year 
net income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

capital expenditures for drydockings and vessel acquisitions drydocking in addition to vessel acquisition and acquisition of new building contracts  other major capital expenditures include funding our drydock program of regularly scheduled in water survey or drydocking necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations 
management anticipates that vessels which are younger than years are required to undergo in water surveys years after a drydock and that vessels are to be drydocked every five years  while vessels years or older are to be drydocked every years in which case the additional drydocks take the place of these in water surveys 
during the year ended december   we paid million of drydock related costs 
for the year ending december   we anticipate that we will capitalize costs associated with drydocks on seven vessels 
we estimate that the expenditures to complete drydocks during will aggregate approximately million and that the vessels will be offhire for approximately days to effect these drydocks and significant in water surveys 
the ability to meet this drydock schedule will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  utilize our revolving credit facilities or secure additional financing 
the united states ratified annex vi to the international maritime organization s marpol convention effective in october this annex relates to emission standards for marine engines in the areas of particulate matter  nox and sox and establishes emission control areas 
the emission program is intended to reduce air pollution from ships by establishing a new tier of performance based standards for diesel engines on all vessels and stringent emission requirements for ships that operate in coastal areas with air quality problems 
on october   the international maritime organization adopted a new set of amendments to annex vi 
these new rules amendments will affect vessels built after the year and could affect vessels built between and we may incur costs to comply with these newly defined standards

other derivative financial instruments freight derivatives as part of our business strategy  we have and may from time to time enter into freight derivative contracts to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
generally  these freight derivative contracts are futures contracts that would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified notional amount of tonnage forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
these contracts generally settle based on the monthly baltic tanker index bitr  which is a worldscale index  and a may also include a specified bunker price index 
the bitr averages rates received in the spot market by cargo type  crude oil and refined petroleum products  and by trade route 
the duration of a contract can be one month  quarterly or up to three years with open positions settling on a monthly basis 
although freight derivatives can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  our objective has been to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
to the extent that we enter into freight derivatives  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market 
during november  the company entered into three freight derivative contracts which expired on december  the company took short positions on two of these contracts for a vlcc tanker route for  metric tons and a long position for  metric tons of a suezmax tanker route 
the company considers all of these contracts to be speculative 
at december   these freight derivatives had an aggregate notional value of  because they expired on that date 
the net fair value of million at december  of these freight derivatives was settled as of december  by the clearinghouse of these agreements whereby deposits the company had with the clearinghouse have been reduced by a like amount  resulting in a realized loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during may  the company entered into a freight derivative contract with the intention of fixing the equivalent of one suezmax vessel to a time charter equivalent rate of  per day for a three year period beginning on july  this contract net settles each month with the company receiving  per day and paying a floating amount based on the monthly bitr and a specified bunker price index 
as of december   the company is not party to any derivatives of this nature 
as of december   the fair market value of the freight derivative  which was determined based on the aggregate discounted cash flows using estimated future rates obtained from brokers  resulted in an asset to the company of million 
the company recorded an unrealized gain loss of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which is reflected on the company s statement of operations as other income expense 
the company has recorded an aggregate realized gain loss of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
currency forward contract on october   the company entered into two call options to purchase at per euro one million euros on january  and one million euros on april  the company paid an aggregate of  for these options 
as of december   the fair value of these options based on the exchange rate on that date resulted in an asset of  which is recorded as derivative asset on the company s balance sheet 
the related unrealized gain for the year ended december  of  is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
the company paid an aggregate of million for options to purchase euros during the year ended december   which is recorded as a realized loss and is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
as of december   the company is not party to any derivatives of this nature 
bunker derivatives during january  we entered into an agreement with a counterparty to purchase  mt per month of gulf coast fuel oil for mt and sell the same amount of rotterdam barges fuel oil for mt 
this contract settled on a net basis at the end of each calendar month from july through september based on the average daily closing prices for these commodities for each month 
during the year ended december   we recognized a realized gain of million  which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
also during january  we entered into an agreement with a counterparty for the five month period from february to june which stipulated a spread between gulf coast fuel oil and houston fuel oil of mt 
the notional amount of fuel oil was  mt each month and the prices of each commodity were determined based on the average closing trading prices during each month 
to the extent the spread was less than mt  we were to pay the counterparty  to the extent the spread is greater than mt we were to collect from the counterparty 
because this contract expired on june   the fair value of this contract is as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized a realized gain of million which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
during november  we entered into an agreement with a counterparty to purchase  mt per month of houston ex wharf fuel oil for mt 
this contract settled on a net basis at the end of each calendar month from january through march based on the average daily closing price for this commodity for each month 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized gain loss of and million  respectively  which is classified as other income expense on the statement of operations 
we consider all of our fuel derivative contracts to be speculative 
as of december   the company is not party to any derivatives of this nature 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recorded when services are rendered  the company has a signed charter agreement or other evidence of an arrangement  pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our revenues are earned under time charters or spot market voyage contracts 
revenue from time charters is earned and recognized on a daily basis 
certain time charters contain provisions which provide for adjustments to time charter rates based on agreed upon market rates 
revenue for spot market voyage contracts is recognized based upon the percentage of voyage completion 
the percentage of voyage completion is based on the number of spot market voyage days worked at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of days expected on the voyage 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we do not provide any reserve for doubtful accounts associated with our voyage revenues because we believe that our customers are of high creditworthiness and there are no serious issues concerning collectibility 
we have had an excellent collection record during the past seven years 
to the extent that some voyage revenues become uncollectible  the amounts of these revenues would be expensed at that time 
we provide a reserve for our demurrage revenues based upon our historical record of collecting these amounts 
as of december  and  we provided a reserve of approximately for these claims  which we believe is adequate in light of our collection history 
we periodically review the adequacy of this reserve so that it properly reflects our collection history 
to the extent that our collection experience warrants a greater reserve we will incur an expense to increase this amount in that period 
in addition  certain of our time charter contracts contain speed and fuel consumption provisions 
we have a reserve for potential claims  which is based on the amount of cumulative time charter revenue recognized under these contracts which we estimate may need to be repaid to the charterer due to failure to meet these speed and fuel consumption provisions 
depreciation and amortization 
we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our double hull tankers on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
we believe that a year depreciable life for double hull vessels is consistent with that of other ship owners and with its economic useful life 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate our residual scrap value per lightweight ton to be an increase in the useful life of the vessel would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
an increase in the residual scrap value would decrease the amount of the annual depreciation charge 
a decrease in the useful life of the vessel would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
a decrease in the residual scrap value would increase the amount of the annual depreciation charge 
replacements  renewals and betterments 
we capitalize and depreciate the costs of significant replacements  renewals and betterments to our vessels over the shorter of the vessel s remaining useful life or the life of the renewal or betterment 
the amount capitalized is based on our judgment as to expenditures that extend a vessel s useful life or increase the operational efficiency of a vessel 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with gaap and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of our vessels 
costs that are not depreciated are written off as a component of direct vessel operating expense during the period incurred 
expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
if the amount of the expenditures we capitalize for replacements  renewals and betterments to our vessels were reduced  we would recognize the amount of the difference as an expense 
deferred drydock costs 
our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we capitalize the costs associated with the drydocks as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydocks 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with gaap guidelines and industry practice 
impairment of long lived assets 
we consider events and circumstances  including the factors in fasb asc  that would have more likely than not require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  we review certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  vessel sales and purchases  business plans and overall market conditions 
we determine undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compare it to the vessel carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  we would determine the fair value of the related asset and we record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
various factors including the use of a trailing year industry average for each vessel class to forecast future charter rates and vessel operating costs are included in this analysis 
during the fourth quarter of  tanker rates continued to remain soft despite our expectation that they would strengthen during the fall and winter months 
additionally  the company obtained third party vessel appraisals during the fourth quarter of which indicated that vessel values had fallen 
as a result of these factors  we concluded that a trigger event had occured and therefore prepared an analysis which estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for each vessel at december  based on this analysis  similar to the results of this procedure performed at december   no impairment was identified for any of our vessels 
time charter asset liability 
when we acquire a vessel with an existing time charter  the fair value of the time charter contract is calculated using the present value based upon an interest rate which reflects our weighted average cost of capital of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the charter terms including estimates for profit sharing to the extent such provisions exist and ii management s estimate of future cash receipts based on its estimate of the fair market charter rate  measured over periods equal to the remaining term of the charter including option periods to extend the time charter contract where the exercise of the option by the charterer is considered probable 
management evaluates the ongoing appropriateness of the amortization period on a quarterly basis by reviewing estimated future time charter rates  reported one to three year time charter rates and historical year average time charter rates and comparing such estimates to the option renewal rates in order to evaluate the probability of the charterer exercising the renewal option 
for time charter contracts where the contractual cash receipts exceed management s estimate of future cash receipts using the fair market charter rate  we have recorded an asset of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which is included in other assets on our balance sheet 
this asset is being amortized as a reduction of voyage revenues over the remaining term of such charters or such earlier date to the extent the option period is declined by the charterer 
for time charter contracts where the management s estimate of future cash receipts using the fair market charter rate exceed contractual cash receipts  we have recorded a liability of million and million as of december  and  respectively  which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on our balance sheet 
this liability is being amortized as an increase in voyage revenues over the remaining term of such charters or such earlier date to the extent the option period is declined by the charterer 
during the third quarter of  we accelerated the amortization on four time charters it acquired during the arlington acquisition  having been informed by the charterer that the options would not be exercised 
accordingly  we accelerated the amortization on these contracts such that the net liability would be fully amortized by the date on which vessel being chartered was redelivered to us 
the incremental effect of this adjustment reduced the time charter liability and asset by million and million  respectively  and resulted in additional voyage revenues recognized of million for the year ended december  goodwill 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other sfas no 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment as of december of each year  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
as each of our vessels is considered an operating segment  each is also considered a reporting unit for testing goodwill for impairment 
accordingly  goodwill  substantially all of which arose in the arlington acquisition  has been allocated to the vessel reporting units based on their proportionate fair value at date of acquisition 
the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered unimpaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of its existing assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the unallocated portion of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss  equivalent to the difference  is recorded as a reduction of goodwill and a charge to operating expense 
in our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  we estimate future net cash flows of operating the vessels in our fleet to which goodwill has been allocated over their remaining useful lives 
for this purpose  over their remaining useful lives  we use the trailing year industry average charter rates for each vessel class recognizing that the transportation of crude oil and petroleum products is cyclical in nature and is subject to wide fluctuation in rates  and we believe the use of a year average is the best measure of future rates over the remaining useful life of our fleet  adjusted for time charter contracts in place and a discount for the first two years 
also for this purpose  we use a utilization rate which was lower than our historic average of approximately 
for the year period ended december   the industry average rates used in our assessment for aframax  suezmax  vlcc  panamax and handymax vessels were     and  respectively 
we expect to incur the following costs over the remaining useful lives of the vessels in our fleet vessel operating costs based on historic and budgeted costs adjusted for inflation  drydocking costs based on historic costs adjusted for inflation  and general and administrative costs adjusted for inflation 
the more significant factors which could impact our assumptions regarding voyage revenues  drydocking costs and general and administrative expenses include  without limitation a loss or reduction in business from our significant customers  b changes in demand  c material decline in rates in the tanker market  d changes in production of or demand for oil and petroleum products  generally or in particular regions  e greater than anticipated levels of tanker new building orders or lower than anticipated rates of tanker scrapping  f changes in rules and regulations applicable to the tanker industry  including  without limitation  legislation adopted by international organizations such as the international maritime organization and the european union or by individual countries  g actions taken by regulatory authorities  and h increases in costs including without limitation crew wages  insurance  provisions  repairs and maintenance 
step of impairment testing consists of determining and comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows  to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
based on performance of this test  the arlington acquisition goodwill allocated to all eight reporting units was determined to be impaired 
the company then undertook the second step of the goodwill impairment test which involves the procedures discussed above 
as a result of our testing  we determined that all of the goodwill allocated to the four handymax vessel reporting units and two panamax vessel reporting units was fully impaired  which resulted in a write off at december  of million 
conversely  the step test did not result in any impairment charge related to the goodwill allocated to our two vlcc vessel reporting units 
the company also had million of goodwill associated with a transaction 
such goodwill is allocated to five aframax vessel reporting units 
this goodwill was also tested for impairment  but each reporting unit passed step  indicating that there was no impairment

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt 
at december   we had million of floating rate debt with a margin over libor of basis points compared to december  when we had million of floating rate debt with margins over libor of ranging from basis points to basis points 
as of december   the company is party to five interest rate swaps which effectively fix libor on an aggregate million of its outstanding floating rate debt to a fixed rates ranging from to 
a one percent increase in libor would increase interest expense on the portion of our million outstanding floating rate indebtedness  which is not hedged  by approximately million per year from december  changes in interest rates would not impact our interest expense for our long term fixed interest rate senior notes 
however  changes in interest rates would impact the fair market value of the senior notes 
in general  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall 
conversely  the fair market value of debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the currently outstanding senior notes accrue interest at the rate of per annum and mature on november  and the effective interest rate on such notes is 
a hypothetical change in interest rates as of december  would have no impact on our interest expense for our fixed interest rate debt 
foreign exchange rate risk the international tanker industry s functional currency is the us dollar 
virtually all of the company s revenues and most of its operating costs are in us dollars 
the company incurs certain operating expenses  drydocking  and overhead costs in foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro  as well as british pounds  japanese yen  singapore dollars  australian dollars and norwegian kroners 
during the year ended december   approximately of the company s direct vessel operating expenses were denominated in these currencies 
the potential additional expense from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates  as it relates to all of these currencies  would be approximately million for the year ended december
