item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview we design  develop  market and license differentiated embedded memory and high speed parallel and serial i o intellectual property  or ip  for advanced systems on chips  or soc  designs 
our patented memory solutions include t sram and t flash high density and or high performance alternatives to traditional volatile and non volatile embedded memory 
our i o ip includes physical layer phy circuitry that allows integrated circuits to talk to each other or to discrete memory devices like ddr in the networking  storage  computer and consumer segments 
our phys support serial interface technologies such as g base kr  xaui  pci express and sata as well as parallel interfaces like ddr our customers typically include fabless semiconductor companies  integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and foundries 
we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and our customers pay us fees for one or more of the following licensing  non recurring engineering services  royalties and maintenance and support 
royalty revenues are typically earned under our memory license agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate any of our memory technologies 
generally  we expect our total sales cycle  or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties  where applicable  from the licensee s use of our technologies  to run from to months 
the portion of our sales cycle from the initial discussion to the receipt of license fees may run from to months  depending on the complexity of the proposed project and degree of development services required 
in the third quarter of  we acquired analog mixed signal integrated circuit designs  intellectual property  related assets and subsidiaries from atmel and ldic 
in december  as part of our initiative to exit unprofitable and non core product lines  we announced our plan to cease all further work and sales activities on the acquired analog mixed signal products  closed our subsidiaries in china and romania  and eliminated approximately employees in the first half of we incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively  related to this product line exit 
in june  we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of prism circuits  inc prism circuits  a provider of high speed parallel and serial i o technology 
the acquisition significantly expanded our product portfolio by adding high speed multi protocol compliant interface technology  which enables communication between semiconductors in a system 
we believe the integration of our patented memory ip and the newly acquired differentiated interface technology will allow us to provide a more comprehensive and competitive solution to our customers  especially in the networking and communications markets 
with the acquisition  we added over engineers experienced in interface technology development and analog mixed signal applications 
we paid prism circuits million in cash reduced by approximately million of cash we acquired at closing and assumed certain of its liabilities as consideration for the acquired assets 
we also agreed to pay up to an additional million of cash as an earn out payment shortly after the first anniversary of the closing date  contingent upon our achievement of certain objectives relating to the prism circuits business during that twelve month period 
to the extent earned  any earn out payment will likely be paid in the third quarter of in addition  in june and july  we granted options to purchase million shares of our common stock to the newly hired prism circuits employees 

table of contents sources of revenue we generate two types of revenue licensing and royalties 
licensing 
licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services  prepaid pre production royalties  and support and maintenance 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which make it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed 
in addition  our licensing revenue fluctuates from period to period  and it is difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue from quarter to quarter 
moreover  we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 
our licensing revenue consists primarily of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification and granting licenses to customers that embed our technology into their products 
license fees generally range from  to several million dollars per contract  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  and the extent of the licensee s rights 
the licensee generally pays the license fees in installments at the beginning of the license term and upon the attainment of specified milestones 
the vast majority of our contracts allow for milestone billing based on work performed 
fees billed prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty 
royalty revenue represents amounts earned under provisions in our memory licensing contracts that require our licensees to report royalties and make payments at a stated rate based on actual units manufactured or sold by licensees for products that include our memory ip 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
royalty bearing license agreements provide for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee through the use of our technology 
our license agreements generally require the licensee to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
as with our licensing revenue  the timing and level of royalties are difficult to predict 
they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and sell products incorporating our technology 
many of the products of our licensees that are currently subject to licenses from us are used in consumer products  such as electronic game consoles  for which demand can be seasonal 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the accounting policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates  and if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 

table of contents revenue recognition general we generate revenue from the licensing of our ip  and customers pay fees for licensing  development services  royalties and maintenance and support 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of signed agreements 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  license and services  we review each element to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the agreement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the consideration payable to us under the agreement is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that unit of accounting 
licensing licensing revenue consists of fees earned from license agreements  development services and support and maintenance 
for license agreements that do not require significant development  modification or customization  revenues are generally recognized when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria have been met 
for license agreements that include deliverables requiring significant production  modification or customization  and where we have significant experience in meeting the design specifications involved in the contract and the direct labor hours related to services under the contract can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
these judgmental elements include determining that we have the experience to meet the design specifications and estimating the total direct labor hours 
we follow this method because it can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the direct labor hours to perform the contract services 
the direct labor hours for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these direct labor hours are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours on a contract by contract basis based on our experience in developing prior licensees designs 
during the contract performance period  we review estimates of direct labor hours to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the direct labor hours to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income in the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
under the percentage of completion method  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined to be likely 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss accrual of  for one agreement 
for the year ended december   we recorded loss accruals on two agreements for a total of  no loss accruals were recorded during the year ended december  if the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  then the excess amount is recorded as an unbilled contracts receivable 
for contracts involving design specifications that we have not previously met or if inherent risks make estimates doubtful  the contract is accounted for under the completed contract method  and we defer the recognition of all revenue until the design meets the contractual design specifications 
in this event  the cost of revenue is expensed as incurred 
when we have experience in meeting design 
table of contents specifications but do not have significant experience to reasonably estimate the direct labor hours related to services to meet a design specification  we defer both the recognition of revenue and the cost 
no revenue was recognized under the completed contract method for the years ended december  and we recognized  of revenue under the completed contract method in we provide support and maintenance under many of our license agreements 
under these arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  design rule changes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value established by objective evidence  ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
these arrangements are generally renewable annually by the customer 
under limited circumstances  we also recognize prepaid pre production royalties as license revenues 
these are lump sum payments made when we enter into licensing agreements that cover future shipments of a product that is not commercially available from the licensee 
we characterize such payments as license revenues because they are paid as part of the initial license fee and not with respect to products being produced by the licensee 
these payments are non cancelable and non refundable 
no revenue from prepaid production royalties was recognized in  and royalty our licensing contracts typically also provide for royalties based on licensees use of our technology in their currently shipping commercial products 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
under limited circumstances  we may also recognize prepaid post production royalties as revenue upon execution of the contract  which are paid in a lump sum after the licensee commences production of the royalty bearing product and applied against future unit shipments regardless of the actual level of shipments by the licensee 
the criteria for revenue recognition of prepaid royalties are that a formal agreement with the licensee is executed  no deliverables  development or support services related to prepaid royalties are required  the fees are non refundable and not contingent upon future product shipments by the licensee  and the fees are payable by the licensee in a time period consistent with our normal billing terms 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer revenue recognition until such time as all criteria have been met 
fair value measurements of financial instruments we measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels  as follows level inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
level pricing is provided by third party sources of market information obtained from investment advisors rather than models 
we do not adjust for or apply any additional assumptions or estimates to the pricing information we receive from advisors 
our level securities include cash equivalents and available for sale securities  which consisted primarily of commercial paper  corporate debt  and government agency and municipal debt securities from issuers with high quality credit ratings 
our investment advisors obtain pricing data from independent sources  such as standard poor s  bloomberg and interactive data corporation  and rely on comparable pricing of other securities because the level securities we hold are not actively traded and have fewer observable transactions 
we consider this the most reliable information available for the valuation of the securities 

table of contents level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment are used to measure fair value 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
the determination of fair value for level investments and other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when a triggering event is deemed to have occurred 
this assessment is subjective in nature and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates and assumptions change in the future  it could result in a material write down of long lived assets 
we amortize our finite lived intangible assets  such as developed technology  patents and workforce  on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to three years 
we recognize an impairment charge as the difference between the net book value of such assets and the fair value of the assets on the measurement date 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we use a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using the market approach 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference 
we performed the annual impairment test during the third quarter of  and the test did not indicate impairment of goodwill 
as of december   we had not identified any factors to indicate there was an impairment of our goodwill 
if our stock price continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  this will impact the fair value of the reporting unit  which can lead to potential impairment in future periods 
deferred tax valuation allowance when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability for each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet under the category of other current assets 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  of which million was attributable to us and state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and million to other temporary differences 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation for equity awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  based on the grant date fair value 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
results of operations in the fourth quarter of  we identified a calculation error in the third party software we use for stock administration 
the calculation errors resulted in an understatement of previously reported non cash stock based compensation expense for the first three quarters of  as well as  and  and changed the timing of stock based compensation expense 
the cumulative effects of this error on our net losses were determined to be immaterial to previously reported financial results 
we have retroactively corrected the amount of such expenses and our net loss for and in the discussion below  which compares the historical results of operations based on us generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended december   and see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
net revenue 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands licensing percentage of total net revenue licensing revenue increased slightly in primarily because of revenue recognized under contracts we assumed in our acquisition of prism circuits 
revenue was recognized under the assumed contracts based on the fair value of the acquired fulfillment effort determined using estimated engineering labor hours required to complete each project 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in the number and value of license agreements for our t sram technology licenses in the million decrease in was primarily due to a decline in the value of license agreements for our t sram licenses compared with  although the total number of licensees increased in specifically  we signed five new licenses for our t sram display driver interface application  which had lower license fees than our traditional t sram 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands royalty percentage of total net revenue royalty revenue decreased million in primarily due to a decrease in royalties earned from a major foundry licensee as a result of a decrease in its shipments of ics incorporating t sram technology and from an idm licensee that provides ics for the nintendo wii game console  which transitioned its manufacturing of those ics to a more advanced processing node during the first half of 
table of contents our license agreement with the idm at the advanced processing node provides for royalty reporting in the quarter following the product shipments in contrast to the previous license agreement  which had been amended in to provide for reporting in the shipment quarter 
the combination of these two factors resulted in a larger decline than would have occurred solely from the decline in game console shipments 
the decrease was partially offset by royalties received from a major oem customer  which commenced reporting and paying royalties in the third quarter of royalty revenue increased million in primarily due to an increase in royalties earned on the sales of socs incorporating our technology by an idm licensee for the nintendo wii game console  an increase in royalties received from a major foundry partner as production on the nm manufacturing process increased  and royalties received from a major oem customer that licenses our t sram for advanced mobile phone applications 
the increases were offset by decreased royalties received from licensees with products incorporating older generation technologies  such as products manufactured on the nm and nm processes 
cost of net revenue and gross profit 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of net revenue percentage of total net revenue cost of net revenue consists of personnel costs for engineers assigned to revenue generating licensing arrangements and related overhead allocation costs 
cost of net revenue declined in primarily because we had fewer t sram license agreements requiring significant engineering services 
cost of net revenue in included stock based compensation expense of million  a decrease of million compared with as a result of the lower cost of net revenue  our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to of total revenue from in we expect that cost of licensing revenue will grow in absolute dollars in the future because we anticipate entering into more license agreements on smaller process geometries  such as the nm process  which require more development effort 
we expect cost as a percentage of total net revenue to increase  as well  from levels in and the increase in cost of net revenue for was primarily due to licensing arrangements for our t sram for use in display driver applications  which required the development of new macros for new foundry processes 
cost of net revenue in included stock based compensation expense of million  a decrease of million compared with as a result of the increased engineering costs to fulfill our delivery obligations  our gross profit decreased from million in to million in and  as a percentage of total net revenue  decreased slightly to of total net revenue in from in research and development 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands research and development percentage of total net revenue our research and development expenses include development and design of variations of our t sram and i o technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees  development of our t flash technology solution  costs related to the development of the bandwidth 
table of contents engine ic and amortization of intangible assets 
in  and  we incurred costs of million  million and million  respectively  related to our former analog mixed signal product lines 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
the million increase in resulted from a number of operational changes in and  including the following million increase in costs related to the operations acquired from prism circuits  million increase in costs related to acquisition related contingent compensation charges  million increase in amortization costs related to acquired intangible assets  partially offset by a million decrease in costs related to the analog mixed signal product lines resulting from the exit of these product lines which was completed in the first quarter of  million decrease in costs related to the closure of our facility in korea in june  and million less in foundry charges related to silicon validation of our designs due to the decline in engineering under license agreement 
the million increase in was primarily due to the combination of the following factors million increase  primarily personnel related  attributable to the analog mixed signal product lines acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of  million increase in costs attributable to the expansion of our engineering team working on our non volatile t flash memory technology and t sram display driver interface applications  million increase in foundry charges to complete validation of our designs in silicon  million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets from the atmel and ldic acquisitions  and million increase in license costs for our cad tools  offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense  and million decrease in other individually minor items 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million for each of the years ended december  and research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  the calculation error affecting stock based compensation resulted in increasing research and development expense by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new product development for our embedded memory and i o technologies and development of the bandwidth engine 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of total net revenue selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  application engineering  finance  human resources and general management 
the million decrease for was primarily due to the combination of the following factors million decrease in stock based compensation expense  million decrease in personnel related costs  primarily due to headcount reductions  million decrease in marketing activities  million decrease in sales expenses and commissions  million decrease in other individually minor items  and million increase in acquisition transaction costs  primarily legal and accounting fees  related to the acquisition of prism circuits in the second quarter of expense for  as corrected for the calculation error related to stock based compensation  was approximately the same as operational changes were as follows million increase in stock based compensation expense  million expense reduction attributable to the reversal of bad debt expense recorded in  million increase attributable to the hiring of additional personnel to expand our sales and marketing organizations to enhance our global presence and add analog mixed signal expertise  million reduction in legal costs  million reduction in personnel costs in the general and administrative function due to lower headcount  and million increase in individually minor items 
selling  general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the calculation error affecting stock based compensation resulted in increasing selling  general and administrative expense by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to an increase in sales and field applications personnel and related costs  higher legal costs related to patent and trademark activity and marketing efforts related to the expected introduction of the bandwidth engine ic in late 
table of contents impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands impairment of intangible assets and restructuring charges percentage of total net revenue in the second quarter of  we recorded million in restructuring charges resulting from the closure of our seoul  korea research and development office and elimination of its positions 
these charges were primarily related to employee terminations and costs to exit the leased facility there 
additionally  restructuring charges of million were recorded in connection with the plan to exit the leased facility that had been occupied by prism circuits 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a plan to exit the unprofitable analog mixed signal product lines  which we had acquired in through asset purchase agreements with atmel and ldic 
in connection with these asset purchases  we had recorded intangible assets  which were being amortized over three to five years 
as a result of the plan to exit these product lines  the remaining book value of these intangible assets of million was considered to have no future value and deemed impaired  as no future cash flows would be generated 
the remaining net book value  as of the date of management s announcement to exit the product lines  was written off 
this plan resulted in the elimination of approximately employees  mainly located in our subsidiaries in china and romania 
the total costs in associated with the restructuring were million  primarily related to accrued employee severance and the write off of computer equipment and other assets 
in the first quarter of  we incurred an additional million related to this exit initiative  primarily in the form of facility related exit costs 
we do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the closure of the china  romania and korea offices and the remaining cash expenditures related to these closures are expected to be paid in the first half of other income  net 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands other income  net percentage of total net revenue other income  net primarily consisted of interest income on our investments  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income declined by million in primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates earned  as we transferred most of our cash into higher credit quality investments  such as money market funds that invest in securities of the us government and its agencies that paid interest at lower rates 

table of contents income tax benefit provision 
year ended december  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income tax benefit provision percentage of total net revenue our income tax benefit was primarily attributable to federal tax credits 
our income tax provisions were primarily attributable to foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and approximately million for state income tax purposes that are available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and state income tax laws 
these net operating loss carryforwards expire from to in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will continue to be less than the federal statutory tax rate because of expected continued losses 
as of december  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we had recorded a full valuation allowance as of december  and liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million compared with a combined balance of million at december  our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital and any acquisitions that we make which require cash consideration or expenditures 
contingent upon meeting specified earn out milestones  we are obligated to pay up to an additional million of cash to prism circuits in in  we used net cash of million in operating activities 
primarily  that amount reflected the net effects of our net loss of million  adjusted for million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of the acquisition of prism circuits  non cash charges  including stock based compensation expense of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million and a non cash restructuring charge of million 
the changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of billing our customers  collection of receivables and payments to vendors 
cash used in operating activities was million for  which primarily resulted from the net loss of million  which was partially offset by non cash charges  including stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization of million  an intangible asset impairment charge of million  non cash restructuring charges of million and million generated from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our investing activities in included a net payment of million for the acquisition of prism circuits and million for purchases of fixed assets during in  we spent approximately million of expenditures for property and equipment 
otherwise  our investing activities consisted of investing our cash in marketable securities and rolling over those investments 
cash used in financing activities consisted of million used for stock repurchases under our repurchase program prior to its suspension in february net cash used in financing activities was million for  which was primarily attributable to million of cash expenditures during the fourth quarter of to repurchase approximately  shares of our own common stock under a 
table of contents repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors  partially offset by proceeds of million from stock option exercises 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing and royalty revenue  cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  including meeting customer design specifications  fabrication costs  including mask costs  of our bandwidth engine integrated circuits  currently under development  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products  competing technological and market developments  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations  and profitability of our business 
although we expect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts in as we continue to expand research and development efforts for our t sram and t flash technologies and the newly introduced bandwidth engine product line  we expect our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  along with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  to be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will not require additional financing at some point in time 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we may need to raise additional funding through public or private financings 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years more than years operating leases purchase commitments capital lease as of december   the company had purchase commitments of million for licenses related to computer aided design tools payable through january and a million capital lease obligation for testing equipment 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties  a failure to perform certain covenants  or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors
