as of january   we had a staff of that includes licensed engineers and other professionals 
based on our revenue  we ranked out of top design firms in engineering news record s design survey 
our traditional clients have been public agencies in communities with populations ranging from  to  people 
we believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects  as well as projects for the private sector 
we also provide services to large public utilities which service major metropolitan communities 
we seek to establish close working relationships with our public agency clients and  over time  to expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them 
while we currently serve communities throughout the country  our business with public agencies is concentrated in california and neighboring states 
we provide services to approximately of the cities and over of the counties in california 
we also serve special districts  school districts  a range of public agencies  and to a lesser extent  private industry 
our business with large public utilities is concentrated in california and new york 
we were founded over years ago  and today consist of a family of wholly owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes engineering services 
our engineering services segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries  willdan engineering  willdan geotechnical  willdan energy solutions  willdan resource solutions and public agency resources pars 
these businesses collectively provide engineering related services  geotechnical engineering services  environmental engineering and environmental related services and energy efficiency  water conservation  sustainability and renewable energy services to public agencies and  to a lesser extent  private industry 
additionally  pars primarily provides staffing to willdan engineering 
willdan engineering is our largest subsidiary and currently represents our core business 
contract revenue for the engineering services segment represented approximately and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 

table of contents public finance services 
our public finance services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  willdan financial services  which offers financial and economic consulting services to public agencies 
for fiscal years and  contract revenue for the public finance services segment represented approximately of our consolidated contract revenue 
homeland security services 
our homeland security services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  willdan homeland solutions  which offers homeland security  management consulting and public safety consulting services 
for fiscal years and  contract revenue for our homeland security services segment represented approximately and  respectively  of our overall contract revenue 
recent developments general economic conditions have continued to decline due to a number of factors including slower economic activity  a lack of available credit  decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending 
these conditions have led to a slowdown in construction  particularly residential housing construction  in the western united states 
as a result of this slowdown  both our engineering services segment and public finance services segment have suffered declines in revenue and operating margin compression 
as a result  we have made several reductions in workforce and facility leases in order to align resources to workload and reduce costs 
should the economic slowdown continue for longer than expected or worsen  we will need to evaluate further reductions in headcount and facilities in business lines that are underperforming 
we will also continue to focus on reducing discretionary expenditures and the efficient procurement of necessary services 
declining revenue resulting from the economic conditions discussed above also contributed to us violating certain financial covenants in fiscal in our revolving credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo 
wells fargo agreed to waive these defaults and eliminate or modify certain financial covenants in exchange for our agreement to reduce the aggregate revolving loan commitment from million to million  amend certain financial covenants  cash collateralize the commitment and increase pricing 
the terms of our amended credit agreement are discussed in more detail below under liquidity and capital resources outstanding indebtedness 
additionally  the credit agreement  as amended  matures on january  and we cannot provide any assurance that wells fargo will renew this line of credit 
while we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our amended credit facility with wells fargo will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for the next months  if we do experience a cash flow shortage or violate the current terms of our credit agreement  we may have difficulty obtaining additional funds on favorable terms  if at all  in the current credit market 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that the estimated value of our financial services segment had declined to a point where it was necessary to recognize impairment for the full amount of the goodwill of million 
components of income and expense contract revenue we enter into contracts with our clients that contain three principal types of pricing provisions fixed price  time and materials and unit based 
contract revenue on our fixed price contracts is determined on the percentage of completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date to estimated total direct costs at completion 
many of our fixed price contracts are relatively short in duration  thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete 
revenue on our time and materials and unit based contracts are recognized as the work is performed in accordance with specific terms of the contract 
approximately of our contracts are based on 
table of contents contractual rates per hour plus costs incurred 
some of these contracts include maximum contract prices  but the majority of these contracts are not expected to exceed the maximum 
adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
when the revised estimate indicates a loss  such loss is provided for currently in its entirety 
claims revenue is recognized only upon resolution of the claim 
change orders in dispute are evaluated as claims 
costs related to un priced change orders are expensed when incurred and recognition of the related contract revenue is based on an evaluation of the probability of recovery of the costs 
estimated profit is recognized for un priced change orders if realization of the expected price of the change order is probable 
direct costs of contract revenue direct costs of contract revenue consist primarily of that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages that has been incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue also include production expenses  sub consultant services and other expenses that are incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue exclude depreciation and amortization  that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts  vacations  holidays and other time not spent directly generating revenue under existing contracts 
such costs are included in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel are included in general and administrative expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue 
no allocation of facilities costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue nor is depreciation and amortization allocated to direct costs 
we expense direct costs of contract revenue when incurred 
as a firm that provides multiple and diverse outsource services  we do not believe gross margin is a consistent or appropriate indicator of our performance and therefore we do not use this measure as construction contractors and other types of consulting firms may 
other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that we classify as general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our direct costs of contract revenue may not be comparable to direct costs for other companies  either as a line item expense or as a percentage of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs  other marketing expenses  management and administrative personnel costs  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of contract revenue for those employees who provide our services 
general and administrative expenses also include facility costs  depreciation and amortization  professional services  legal and accounting fees and administrative operating costs 
within general and administrative expenses  other includes expenses such as professional services  legal and accounting  computer costs  travel and entertainment and marketing costs 
we expense general and administrative costs when incurred 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
to prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report 

table of contents contract accounting applying the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenue requires us to estimate the indicated outcome of our long term contracts 
we forecast such outcomes to the best of our knowledge and belief of current and expected conditions and our expected course of action 
differences between our estimates and actual results often occur resulting in changes to reported revenue and earnings 
such changes could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based upon our review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
our credit risk is minimal with governmental entities 
account receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
for further information on the types of contracts under which we perform our services  see business contract structure elsewhere in this report 
goodwill we test goodwill  at least annually  for possible impairment 
accordingly  we complete our annual testing of goodwill as of the last day of the first month of our fourth fiscal quarter each year to determine whether there is impairment 
in addition to our annual test  we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill 
we recognized impairment charges for fiscal year related to our public finance services reporting unit and for fiscal year related to our homeland security services reporting unit 
neither our public finance services reporting unit nor our homeland security services reporting unit have any remaining goodwill following these impairment charges 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal year we test our goodwill for impairment at the level of our reporting units  which are components of our operating segments 
the reporting unit that still has a material amount of goodwill is willdan energy solutions  which is part of our engineering services segment 
the process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  we have historically used an income approach based on a multiple of historical cash flows  management s estimates of future cash flows and other market data 
in fiscal year  we expanded our methodology to include a market approach based upon multiples of ebitda earned by similar public companies 
for our fiscal years and annual impairment testing  we weighted the income approach and the market approach at and  respectively 
the income approach was given a higher weight because it has a more direct correlation to the specific economics of the reporting units than the market approach  which is based on multiples of public companies that  although comparable  may not provide the same mix of services as our reporting units 
once the fair value is determined  we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value  we perform an additional assessment to determine the extent of the impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in the event that the current implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized 
inherent in such fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates  including but not limited to assumptions about our future revenue  profitability and cash flows  our operational plans and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
to the extent these assumptions are incorrect or economic conditions that would impact the future operations of our reporting units change  our goodwill may be deemed to be impaired  and an impairment charge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation 
at our measurement 
table of contents date  the estimated fair value of our energy solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
accounting for claims against the company we record liabilities to claimants for probable and estimable claims  if any  on our consolidated balance sheet  which we include in accrued liabilities  and record a corresponding receivable from our insurance company for the portion of the claim that is probable of being covered by insurance  which is included in other receivables 
the estimated claim amount net of the amount estimated to be recoverable from the insurance company is included in our general and administrative expenses 
determining probability and estimating claim amounts is highly judgmental 
initial accruals and any subsequent changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

our homeland security services segment generated million during this period 
consolidated contract revenue decreased million  or  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease of million  or  in contract revenue of the engineering service segment  and a decrease of million  or  in our public finance services segment  offset by an increase of million  or  in contract revenue of our homeland security services segment 
contract revenue of the engineering services segment has been significantly impacted by the decline in the california residential housing market and state and local government budget deficits 
a historical significant source of revenue in our engineering services segment is fees assessed for building permits 
since the second half of fiscal  we have experienced reductions in revenue from these fees because of the continuing slowdown in residential construction in the western united states 
revenue declines in the public finance services segment were primarily due to decreased financial consulting services and fewer new district formations to fund infrastructure projects  partially offset by increased delinquency management services 
revenue in homeland security services has increased due to an increase in our emergency response training courses and exercises  emergency operations planning and other public safety and management consulting services 
direct costs of contract revenue

the million difference was attributable to an increase in cost in our homeland security services segment 
the decrease in direct costs of contract revenue for our engineering services segment and public finance services segment is primarily due to decreased direct salary costs 
direct costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended january  increased to from for the fiscal year ended january   primarily because contract revenue decreased at a higher rate than the direct costs 
within direct costs of contract revenue  salaries and wages decreased to of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended january  from for the fiscal year ended january  comparing those same periods  sub consultant services increased to of contract revenue from of contract revenue 
sub consultant costs increased primarily due to our activity associated with our energy efficiency practice in our engineering services segment where we outsource installation services 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january  of the net million decrease  million was due to a decrease in salaries and wages  payroll taxes and employee benefits 
the reduction in employee related costs are the direct result of continued cost reduction efforts 
included in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january  is million in goodwill impairment charges and million in lease abandonment expense  which were partially offset by a favorable legal settlement of million 
lease abandonment expense includes future rental obligations and other costs associated with leased space that we have ceased to use  offset by future proceeds from sublease arrangements

our revenue for fiscal year also includes million of revenue from willdan energy solutions  which we acquired in june contract revenue of the engineering services segment has been significantly impacted by the decline in the california residential housing market and state and local government budget cuts 
a source of revenue in our engineering services segment is fees assessed for building permits 
since the second half of fiscal  we have experienced reductions in revenue from these fees because of the continuing slowdown in residential construction in the western united states 
the million decrease in contract revenue for the engineering services segment is net of million of revenue recognized by willdan energy solutions following our acquisition of willdan energy solutions in june our public finance services business  specifically district administration projects  tends to run counter cyclical to the residential housing market 
revenue in the public finance services segment increased primarily due to increased district formation services to fund infrastructure projects as well as increased delinquency management services in our district administration services 
revenue in homeland security services has increased due to an increase in our emergency response training courses  particularly in southern california 
additionally  our homeland security services segment has expanded its service offerings beyond its traditional training services to include training exercises and management consulting services

the remaining million increase was attributable to the homeland security services segment 
the increase in direct costs of contract revenue for our engineering services segment is primarily due to increased salary  sub consultant and other direct costs related to willdan energy solutions which we acquired in june  offset by decreases in direct salary costs across other areas of the segment 
increases in direct costs of contract revenue for our public finance services and homeland security services segments were primarily the result of the increased volume of activity that generated the increased contract revenue previously discussed for these operating segments 
direct costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended january  increased to from for the fiscal year ended december   primarily because contract revenue in our engineering services segment decreased at a higher rate than the direct costs of contract revenue attributable to this segment 
within direct costs of contract revenue  salaries and wages decreased to of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended january  from for the fiscal year ended december  comparing those same periods  sub consultant services increased to of contract revenue from of contract revenue

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the million decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to decreases in salaries and wages  payroll taxes and employee benefits and other general and administrative expenses 
the reduction in employee related costs primarily resulted from reductions in headcount and cost control measures 
the reduction in other general and administrative expenses related to cost control measures and reductions in professional service costs primarily related to the legal costs incurred during fiscal year for the settlement of the west hollywood litigation and lower professional fees during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily because we had to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act for the first time in fiscal year the decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increases of million in amortization of acquired intangibles related to willdan energy solutions  million of lease abandonment costs and million of goodwill impairments

table of contents other expense income 
other income  net  decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million of income in the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to i a decrease in interest income of million resulting primarily from a reduction in average invested balances due to the purchase of willdan energy solutions  and ii an increase in interest expense of million related primarily to the inclusion in fiscal year of a reversal of million of accrued interest related to the west hollywood litigation that was settled without payment of interest 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended december  net loss income 
as a result of the above factors  our net loss was million for the fiscal year ended january   compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next months 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and cash flows used in operating activities of million for fiscal year the cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year were comparatively lower than in fiscal year due primarily to a higher net loss partially offset by non cash impairment charges related to goodwill  lease abandonment expenses and the collection of the income tax receivable accrued during fiscal year the cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year also included an increase in collection of accounts receivable and the payment of accrued liabilities related to litigation accrued in fiscal year  net of amounts paid for by our insurance company 
higher cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year were partially offset by a net loss incurred in fiscal year compared to net income earned in fiscal year cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year payments for business acquisitions  net of cash acquired  in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal these payments were in accordance with the provisions of the stock purchase agreement for the purchase of willdan energy solutions  formerly known as intergy corp 
fiscal years and also contained purchases of liquid investments and proceeds from sales of liquid investments 
aside from payments for business acquisitions  our cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal was million as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the net cash flows provided in was primarily attributable to borrowings under our line of credit to support working capital needs 
the decrease of cash used in financing activities for fiscal year over fiscal year resulted primarily from the fiscal year payment of million in distributions to holders of our redeemable common stock  partially offset by an increase in net 
table of contents payments of notes payable of million 
the fiscal year distribution was our final s corporation distribution to our stockholders and we used the proceeds from our initial public offering to pay this amount 
outstanding indebtedness we currently have a revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  which was amended on november  we have also financed  from time to time  insurance premiums by entering into unsecured notes payable with insurance companies 
during our annual insurance renewals in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended january   we elected not to finance our insurance premiums for the upcoming fiscal year 
under the terms of our credit agreement with wells fargo  we can borrow up to million from time to time as may be limited by the covenants in the credit agreement as discussed below up to and until january  loans made under the revolving line of credit will accrue interest at either i the floating rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time or ii the fixed rate of above libor  at our election 
for prime rate loans  the interest rate will be adjusted when each prime rate change by the bank is announced and becomes effective 
there were outstanding borrowings of million under this agreement as of january  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by all of our accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment  including those of our subsidiaries 
in addition  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by investment property we hold in a securities account at wells fargo that must at all times have a collateral value of at least million 
each of our subsidiaries except public agency resources and willdan resource solutions has signed an unconditional guaranty of our obligations under the agreements 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and affirmative covenants  including a covenant to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million at all times 
tangible net worth is defined in the credit agreement as stockholders equity less intangible assets and loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
as of january   our tangible net worth as defined under our credit agreement was million 
tangible net worth is a supplemental measure used in our credit agreement 
if we do not maintain tangible net worth of at least million  wells fargo could choose to accelerate any loans then outstanding under the facility or refuse to make additional loans to us under the facility 
management therefore believes that presentation of tangible net worth as defined in the credit agreement is useful to investors because it helps them understand how our tangible net worth compares to the financial covenant contained in our credit agreement and whether we are close to violating such covenant 
management also reviews tangible net worth to ensure it will continue to have access to its financing sources 
tangible net worth is defined in the credit agreement as the aggregate of total stockholders equity less any intangible assets and less any loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
for the purposes of calculating tangible net worth  the impact of non cash property lease termination expense of up to  in the aggregate recorded during the period from october  through december  will be excluded from the covenant calculation 
this definition of tangible net worth may differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
this measure should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  such as stockholders equity 
tangible net worth is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to stockholders equity as an indicator of net worth or any other gaap measure 
the following is a reconciliation of stockholders equity to tangible net worth as of january  stockholders equity goodwill and other intangibles  net permitted lease abandonment tangible net worth 
table of contents prior to the amendment of the credit agreement in march  the credit agreement contained additional financial covenants  including minimum net income and maximum net loss covenants 
as discussed above in recent developments  we breached our minimum net income covenant for the quarter ended september  and  in exchange for wells fargo s waiver of this breach  we amended our credit agreement in december to reduce the amount available under the facility from million to million and to revise the financial covenants under the facility 
we also breached our maximum net loss covenant for the year ended january  by sustaining net losses before taxes greater than million 
in march  wells fargo waived this breach and eliminated or modified certain financial covenants in the credit agreement in exchange for increased pricing and additional collateral being provided 
the credit agreement also includes customary negative covenants  including a covenant that prohibits the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us or our subsidiaries other than purchase money indebtedness not to exceed million and indebtedness existing on the date of the credit agreement  and a covenant that prohibits payment of dividends on our stock and redemptions  repurchases or other acquisitions of our stock  provided that we can repurchase stock with an aggregate fair market value up to million in any calendar year 
in addition  the credit agreement includes customary events of default for a credit facility 
upon a default  the interest rate will be increased by a default rate margin of 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit agreement  including a breach of any of the covenants discussed above  wells fargo has the option to make any loans then outstanding under the credit agreement immediately due and payable and is no longer obligated to extend further credit to us under the credit agreement 
contractual obligations we have certain cash obligations and other commitments which will impact our short and long term liquidity 
at january   such obligations and commitments consisted of long term debt  operating leases and capital leases 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of january  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt includes principal and interest payments under our debt agreements assuming no additional borrowings or principal payments and includes borrowings under our line of credit of  new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a standard entitled the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  a replacement of fasb no 
this standard establishes the fasb accounting standards codification codification  as the single source of authoritative united states accounting and reporting standards applicable for all non government entities  with the exception of the securities and exchange commission rules and interpretative releases 
the codification  which changes the referencing of financial standards  is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after september  as the codification is not intended to change or alter existing us gaap  the adoption of the standard did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued a standard entitled determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this standard amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under the standard for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the standard on january  and this had no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a standard entitled business combinations 
this standard establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the standard makes significant changes to existing accounting practices for acquisitions and applies prospectively to business combinations consummated on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period on or after december  we adopted the new standard effective january  and the adoption did not have any effect on our financial statements and disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of january  this amount includes million invested in the wells fargo stage coach sweep investment account  million invested in the wells fargo money market mutual fund and million invested in the wells fargo advantage heritage fund 
although these investments are subject to variable interest rates  we do not believe we are subject to significant market risk for these short term investments 
we do not engage in trading activities and do not participate in foreign currency transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments 
as of january   we had million outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility that bears interest at variable rates
