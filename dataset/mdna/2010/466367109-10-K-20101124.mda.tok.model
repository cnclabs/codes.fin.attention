sales at jack in the box restaurants continue to be impacted by high unemployment rates in our major markets for our key customer demographics 
commodity costs 
pressures from higher commodity costs  which negatively impacted our business in fiscal  moderated somewhat in overall commodity costs at jack in the box restaurants decreased approximately after increasing approximately in  as lower costs for beef  shortening  poultry and bakery were partially offset by higher costs for produce and pork

these closures are expected to have a positive impact on future earnings and cash flows 
new unit development

table of contents revenues as we execute our refranchising strategy  which includes the sale of restaurants to franchisees  we expect the number of company operated restaurants and the related sales to continually decrease while revenues from franchise restaurants increase 
company restaurant sales decreased million in and million in compared with the prior years 
the decrease in restaurant sales in both years is due primarily to decreases in the average number of jack in the box company operated restaurants and declines in same store sales at jack in the box restaurants  partially offset by an increase in the number of qdoba company operated restaurants and  in  additional sales of million from a rd week

the decline reflects unfavorable product mix changes  promotions and discounting 
sales continue to be impacted by high unemployment rates in our major markets 
distribution sales to jack in the box and qdoba franchisees grew million in and million in compared with the prior year 
the increase in distribution sales in both years primarily relates to an increase in the number of jack in the box and qdoba franchise restaurants serviced by our distribution centers  which contributed additional sales of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and were partially offset by lower per store average psa volumes in both years 
the increase in also includes sales of approximately million from the rd week 
franchise revenues increased million and million in and  respectively  primarily reflecting an increase in the average number of jack in the box franchise restaurants and  in  additional revenues of million from a rd week  offset in part by a decline in same store sales at jack in the box franchise restaurants 
the increase in the average number of restaurants due to refranchising activity contributed additional royalties  rents and fees of approximately million and million in and  respectively

payroll and employee benefit costs were of company restaurant sales in and in and the increase in reflects the impact of same store sales deleverage and higher workers compensation costs of approximately basis points  which more than offset the benefits derived from our labor productivity initiatives 
workers compensation costs have increased as the cost per claim is trending higher although the number of claims is lower 
in labor productivity initiatives offset minimum wage increases 
occupancy and other costs were of company restaurant sales in  in and in the higher percentage in is due primarily to sales deleverage and higher depreciation from the ongoing re image program at jack in the box  which were partially offset by lower utilities expense 
the increase in was due primarily to higher depreciation expense related to the jack in the box re image program and a kitchen enhancement project completed in  higher rent and depreciation related to new restaurant development at qdoba and sales deleverage at jack in the box and qdoba restaurants  which were partially offset by lower utility costs 
distribution costs increased to million in from million in and million in  primarily reflecting increases in the related sales 
these costs increased to of distribution sales in  compared with in and in  due primarily to deleverage from lower psa sales at jack in the box franchise restaurants

the increase in is due primarily to the closure of underperforming jack in the box restaurants in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the decision to close these restaurants was based on a comprehensive analysis performed that took into consideration levels of return on investment and other key operating performance metrics 
in connection with these closures  we recorded a total charge of million which included property and equipment impairment charges of million and million related to future lease commitments 
gains on the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  net are detailed in the following table dollars in thousands number of restaurants sold to franchisees gains on the sale of company operated restaurants loss on expected sale of underperforming market gains on the sale of company operated restaurants  net average gain on restaurants sold gains were impacted by the number of restaurants sold and changes in average gains recognized  which relate to the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants

interest expense  net interest expense  net is comprised of the following in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million in and million in due primarily to lower average interest rates 
in  lower average borrowings  partially offset by a million charge to write off deferred financing fees in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility  also contributed to the decrease 
in  higher average borrowings partially offset the impact of lower interest rates 
income taxes the income tax provisions reflect effective tax rates of  and of pretax earnings from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in is largely attributable to the impact of impairment and other charges  higher work opportunity tax credits and the market performance of insurance investment products used to fund certain non qualified retirement plans 
changes in the cash value of the insurance products are not included in taxable income 

table of contents earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations were million  or per diluted share  in  million  or per diluted share  in  and million  or per diluted share  in we estimate that the extra rd week benefitted net earnings by approximately million  or per diluted share  in fiscal earnings from discontinued operations  net as described in the financial reporting section  quick stuff s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations 
in  the loss from discontinued operations  net was million  reflecting the million net of tax loss from the sale of quick stuff in the fourth quarter 
earnings from discontinued operations  net were million in liquidity and capital resources general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
our cash requirements consist principally of working capital  capital expenditures for new restaurant construction and restaurant renovations  income tax payments  debt service requirements  and obligations related to our benefit plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets  which results in a working capital deficit 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at october  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to repurchases of common stock  net repayments under our credit facility  and property and equipment expenditures 
these uses of cash were offset in part by proceeds from the sale and leaseback of restaurant properties  cash flows provided by operating activities  and proceeds and collections of notes receivable from the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  to reduce debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock 

table of contents cash flows 
the table below summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands 
total cash provided by used in operating activities continuing operations discontinued operations investing activities continuing operations discontinued operations financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
operating cash flows from continuing operations decreased million in compared with due primarily to the timing of working capital receipts and disbursements and a decrease in cash flows related to higher company restaurant costs  our refranchising strategy and same store sales declines at our jack in the box restaurants 
in  cash flows from continuing operations decreased million compared with due to a decrease in earnings from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by fluctuations due to the timing of working capital receipts and disbursements 
operating cash flows from our discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated statements of cash flows for all fiscal years presented 
investing activities 
investing activity cash flows from continuing operations increased million in compared with this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of sites that we sold and leased back and lower spending for purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by decreases in proceeds from and collections of notes receivable related to the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
in  cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased million compared with this decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash proceeds from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  lower spending for purchases of property and equipment and an increase in collections on notes receivable  offset in part by an increase in spending related to assets held for sale and leaseback and cash used in to acquire qdoba franchise operated restaurants 
in  cash flows provided by discontinued operations increased million compared with due primarily to proceeds received in of million related to the sale of our quick stuff convenience and fuel stores 
assets held for sale and leaseback 
we use sale and leaseback financing to lower the initial cash investment in our jack in the box restaurants to the cost of the equipment  whenever possible 
in  of our new jack in the box restaurants were developed as sale and leaseback properties  compared with in and in in  we sold and leased back restaurants compared with four in and in as of october   we had cash investments of million in approximately operating and under construction restaurant properties that we expect to sell and lease back during fiscal capital expenditures 
the composition of capital expenditures used in continuing operations in each year follows in thousands jack in the box new restaurants restaurant facility improvements other  including corporate qdoba total capital expenditures used in continuing operations our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new locations  restaurant remodeling  new equipment and information technology enhancements 
in  capital expenditures decreased 
table of contents due primarily to a decline in the number of new jack in the box and qdoba restaurants developed and the number of existing restaurants rebuilt  and lower spending related to our re image program and network and system upgrades 
in  we continued reimaging our restaurants  focusing on the interiors as we substantially completed reimaging the restaurant exteriors in the reimage program  which began in  is an important part of the chain s brand reinvention initiative and is intended to create a warm and inviting dining experience for jack in the box guests 
as of october   approximately of all jack in the box company operated restaurants feature all interior and exterior elements of the reimage program  we expect completion by the end of fiscal year in  capital expenditures decreased due to lower spending related to our reimage program as well as the inclusion of a kitchen enhancement project and the purchase of our smoothie equipment in the kitchen enhancements were designed to increase restaurant capacity for new product introductions while reducing utility expense using energy efficient equipment 
in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  including investment costs related to the jack in the box restaurant re image program and the continued rollout of our new logo 
we plan to open approximately new jack in the box and new qdoba company operated restaurants in sale of company operated restaurants 
we have continued to expand franchise ownership in the jack in the box system primarily through the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
the following table details proceeds received in connection with our refranchising activities in thousands number of restaurants sold to franchisees cash proceeds from the sale of company operated restaurants notes receivable total proceeds average proceeds all fiscal years presented include financing provided to facilitate the closing of certain transactions 
as of october   notes receivable related to refranchisings were million  of which million has been repaid since the end of the fiscal year 
we expect total proceeds of million from the sale of jack in the box restaurants in acquisition of franchise operated restaurants 
in  we acquired qdoba franchise operated restaurants in the boston market for approximately million 
the purchase price was allocated to property and equipment  goodwill and reacquired franchise rights 
for additional information  refer to note  initial franchise fees  refranchisings and acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we acquired qdoba franchise operated restaurants for approximately million  net of cash received 
the total purchase price was allocated to property and equipment  goodwill and other income 
the restaurants acquired are located in michigan and california  which we believe provide good long term growth potential consistent with our strategic goals 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities increased million in and million in compared with the previous year 
these increases were primarily attributable to purchases of our common stock in and the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility in new credit facility 
on june   we replaced our existing credit facility with a new credit facility intended to provide a more flexible capital structure 
the new credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility and ii a million term loan with a five year maturity  initially both with london interbank offered rate libor plus 
in connection with the refinancing  borrowings under the term loan and million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to repay all borrowings under the prior credit facility and related transaction fees and expenses  including those associated with the new credit facility 
loan origination costs associated with the new credit facility were million and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of october  as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the new credit facility 
table of contents requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
we may make voluntary prepayments of the loans under the revolving credit facility and term loan at any time without premium or penalty 
specific events  such as asset sales  certain issuances of debt and insurance and condemnation recoveries  may trigger a mandatory prepayment 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our credit facility  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments  stock repurchases  dividend payments and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
at october   we had million outstanding under the term loan  borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million and letters of credit outstanding of million 
for additional information related to our credit facility  refer to note  indebtedness  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swaps 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under our credit facility  we consider interest rate swaps 
in august  we entered into two forward looking swaps that will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan to a fixed rate basis beginning september through september based on the term loan s applicable margin of as of october   these agreements would have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of 
previously  we held two interest rate swaps that effectively converted million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis from march to april  for additional information related to our interest rate swaps  refer to note  derivative instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
repurchases of common stock 
in november  the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock over three years expiring november  during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of october   the aggregate remaining amount authorized and available under our credit agreement for repurchase was million 
in november  the board of directors approved a new program to repurchase  within the next year  up to million in shares of our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we finance a portion of our new restaurant development through sale leaseback transactions 
these transactions involve selling restaurants to unrelated parties and leasing the restaurants back 
additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item  properties  and note  leases  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october  in thousands payments due by year total less than year years years after years contractual obligations credit facility term loan revolving credit facility capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments benefit obligations total contractual obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit 
table of contents obligations related to our credit facility include interest expense estimated at interest rates in effect on october  includes purchase commitments for food  beverage  packaging items and certain utilities 
includes expected payments associated with our defined benefit plans  postretirement benefit plans and our non qualified deferred compensation plan through fiscal consists primarily of letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan qualified plan covering substantially all full time employees 
our policy is to fund our qualified plan at amounts necessary to satisfy the minimum amount required by law  plus additional amounts as determined by management to improve the plan s funded status 
based on the funding status of our qualified plan as of our last measurement date  we are not required to make a minimum contribution in however  we expect to make discretionary contributions of million which have been included in the table above 
effective september  we amended our qualified plan whereby participants will no longer accrue benefits after december  as a result  our discretionary contributions will likely be lower in the future when compared with recent years 
contributions beyond fiscal will depend on pension asset performance  future interest rates  future tax law changes  and future changes in regulatory funding requirements 
for additional information related to our pension plans  refer to note  retirement plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
discussion of critical accounting estimates we have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review generally includes a restaurant level analysis  except when we are actively selling a group of restaurants  in which case we perform our impairment evaluations at the group level 
impairment evaluations for individual restaurants take into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  refranchising expectations  and the maturity of the related market 
impairment evaluations for a group of restaurants take into consideration the group s expected future cash flows and sales proceeds from bids received  if any  or fair market value based on  among other considerations  the specific sales and cash flows of those restaurants 
if the assets of a restaurant or group of restaurants subject to our impairment evaluation are not recoverable based upon the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds fair value 
our estimates of cash flows used to assess impairment are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during fiscal year  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to write down certain assets to their estimated fair value 
retirement benefits our defined benefit and other postretirement plans costs and liabilities are determined using several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  including assumptions about the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
our discount rate is set annually by us  with assistance from our actuaries  and is determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a population of high quality bonds with a moody s or standard and poor s rating of aa or better meeting certain other criteria 
as of october   our discount rate was for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
our expected long term rate of return on assets is determined taking into consideration our projected asset allocation and economic forecasts prepared with the assistance of our actuarial consultants 
as of october   our assumed expected long term rate of return was for our qualified defined benefit plan 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the amount of pension expense we record 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our fiscal pension and postretirement plan expense 
we expect our pension and 
table of contents postretirement expense to decrease in fiscal principally due to the curtailment of our qualified plan which will be partially offset by a decrease in our discount rate from to 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation  general liability  automotive  and health benefits 
in estimating our self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analysis of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
restaurant closing costs restaurant closing costs consist of future lease commitments  net of anticipated sublease rentals and expected ancillary costs 
we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  at the date we cease using a property 
subsequent adjustments to the liability as a result of changes in estimates of sublease income or lease cancellations are recorded in the period incurred 
the estimates we make related to sublease income are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual sublease income due to changes in economic conditions  desirability of the sites and other factors 
share based compensation we offer share based compensation plans to attract  retain and motivate key officers  non employee directors and employees to work toward the financial success of the company 
share based compensation cost for our stock option grants is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
we have good relationships with our franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts  as we deem appropriate 
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits  effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
we adjust our effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 
our estimates are based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 

table of contents future application of accounting principles in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for consolidation  which changes the approach for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity and requires more frequent reassessments of whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary 
this guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after november  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact this guidance may have on our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to risks relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of october   the applicable margin for the libor based revolving loans and term loan was set at we use interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in august  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis beginning september through september based on the term loan s applicable margin of as of october   these agreements would have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at october   would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time  we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
at october   we had no such contracts in place
