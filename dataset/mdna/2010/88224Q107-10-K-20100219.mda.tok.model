overview of our business operations we commenced operations in december an important aspect of our growth strategy has been our ability to service and effectively manage a large number of loans and deposit accounts in multiple markets in texas 
accordingly  we created an operations infrastructure sufficient to support state wide lending and banking operations 
the following discussions and analyses present the significant factors affecting our financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements appearing later in this report 
please also note the below description about our discontinued operations and how it is reflected in the following discussions of our financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we completed the sale of our residential mortgage lending division rml 
the sale was effective as of september   and  accordingly  all operating results for this discontinued component of our operations were reclassified to discontinued operations 
all prior periods were restated to reflect the change 
subsequent to the end of the first quarter of  texas capital bank and the purchaser of its residential mortgage loan division rml agreed to terminate and settle the contractual arrangements related to the sale of the division 
the loss from discontinued operations was  and  net of taxes  for the years and  respectively 
the losses are primarily related to continuing legal and salary expenses incurred in dealing with the remaining loans and requests from investors related to the repurchase of previously sold loans 
we still have approximately  in loans held for sale from discontinued operations that are carried at the estimated market value at year end  which is less than the original cost 
we plan to sell these loans  but timing and price to be realized cannot be determined at this time due to market conditions 
in addition  we continue to address requests from investors related to repurchasing loans previously sold 
while the balances as of december  include a liability for exposure to additional contingencies  including risk of having to repurchase loans previously sold  we recognize that market conditions may result in additional exposure to loss and the extension of time necessary to complete the discontinued mortgage operation 
our mortgage warehouse operations were not part of the sale  and are included in the results from continuing operations 
except as otherwise noted  all amounts and disclosures throughout this document reflect only the company s continuing operations

service charges increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in due to lower earnings credit rates and an increase in fees 
while management expects continued growth in non interest income  the future rate of growth could be affected by increased competition from nationwide and regional financial institutions and by decreased demand in mortgage warehouse volume 
in order to achieve continued growth in non interest income  we may need to introduce new products or enter into new markets 
any new product introduction or new market entry could place additional demands on capital and managerial resources

analysis of financial condition loan portfolio our loan portfolio has grown at an annual rate of  and in  and  respectively  reflecting the build up of our lending operations 
our business plan focuses primarily on lending to middle market businesses and high net worth individuals  and as such  commercial and real estate loans have comprised a majority of our loan portfolio since we commenced operations  comprising of total loans at december  construction loans have decreased from of the portfolio at december  to of the portfolio at december  consumer loans generally have represented or less of the portfolio from december  to december  loans held for sale  which relates to our mortgage warehouse operations and are principally mortgage loans being warehoused for sale typically within to days  fluctuate based on the level of market demand in the product 
due to market conditions experienced in the mortgage industry during  loans not sold within the normal timeframe were transferred to the loans held for investment portfolio 
loans were transferred at a lower of cost or market basis and are then subject to normal loan review  grading and reserve allocation requirements 
the remaining balance of loans transferred was million at december   and million of such loans were npas with allocated reserves of approximately  we originate substantially all of the loans held in our portfolio  except participations in residential mortgage loans held for sale  select loan participations and syndications  which are underwritten independently by us prior to purchase  and certain usda and sba government guaranteed loans that we purchase in the secondary market 
we also participate in syndicated loan relationships  both as a participant and as an agent 
as of december   we have million in syndicated loans  million of which we acted as agent 
all syndicated loans  whether we act as agent or participant  are underwritten to the same standards as all other loans originated by us 
in addition  as of  million of our syndicated loans were nonperforming  and none are considered potential problem loans 

table of contents the following summarizes our loan portfolio on a gross basis by major category as of the dates indicated in thousands december commercial construction real estate consumer equipment leases loans held for sale total commercial loans and leases 
our commercial loan portfolio is comprised of lines of credit for working capital and term loans and leases to finance equipment and other business assets 
our energy production loans are generally collateralized with proven reserves based on appropriate valuation standards 
our commercial loans and leases are underwritten after carefully evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably 
our underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than making loans on a transaction basis 
our lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line 
lines of credit and term loans typically are reviewed annually and are supported by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and other assets of our clients businesses 
at december   funded commercial loans and leases totaled approximately billion  approximately of our total funded loans 
real estate loans 
approximately of our real estate loan portfolio excluding construction loans and of the total portfolio is comprised of loans secured by properties other than market risk or investment type real estate 
market risk loans are real estate loans where the primary source of repayment is expected to come from the sale or lease of the real property collateral 
we generally provide temporary financing for commercial and residential property 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
our real estate loans generally have maximum terms of five to seven years  and we provide loans with both floating and fixed rates 
we generally avoid long term loans for commercial real estate held for investment 
real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy 
appraised values may be highly variable due to market conditions and impact of the inability of potential purchasers and lessees to obtain financing and lack of transactions at comparable values 
at december   real estate term loans totaled approximately billion  or of our total funded loans  of this total   million were loans with floating rates and million were loans with fixed rates 
construction loans 
our construction loan portfolio consists primarily of single family residential properties and commercial projects used in manufacturing  warehousing  service or retail businesses 
our construction loans generally have terms of one to three years 
we typically make construction loans to developers  builders and contractors that have an established record of successful project completion and loan repayment and have a substantial investment of the borrowers equity 
however  construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from other lenders  sales of developed property  or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained 
the nature of these loans makes ultimate repayment extremely sensitive to overall economic conditions 
borrowers may not be able to correct conditions of default in loans  increasing risk of exposure to classification  npa status  reserve allocation and actual credit loss and foreclosure 
these loans typically have floating rates and commitment fees 
at december   funded construction real estate loans totaled approximately million  approximately of our total funded loans 
loans held for sale 
our loans held for sale portfolio consists of participations purchased in single family residential mortgages funded through our mortgage warehouse group 
these loans are typically on our 
table of contents balance sheet for to days or less 
we have agreements with brokers and participate in individual loans they originate 
all loans are subject to pre committed programs for permanent financing with financially sound investors 
substantially all loans are conforming loans 
at december   loans held for sale totaled approximately million  approximately of our total funded loans 
letters of credit 
we issue standby and commercial letters of credit  and can service the international needs of our clients through correspondent banks 
at december   our commitments under letters of credit totaled approximately million 
portfolio geographic and industry concentrations we continue to lend primarily in texas 
as of december   a substantial majority of the principal amount of the loans held for investment in our portfolio was to businesses and individuals in texas 
this geographic concentration subjects the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions in texas 
the table below summarizes the industry concentrations of our funded loans at december  the risks created by these concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses on loans at each balance sheet date 
percent of total in thousands amount loans services loans held for sale contracting construction and real estate development investors and investment management companies petrochemical and mining personal household manufacturing retail wholesale contracting trades government agriculture total our largest concentration in any single industry is in services 
loans extended to borrowers within the services industries include loans to finance working capital and equipment  as well as loans to finance investment and owner occupied real estate 
significant trade categories represented within the services industries include  but are not limited to  real estate services  financial services  leasing companies  transportation and communication  and hospitality services 
borrowers represented within the real estate services category are largely owners and managers of both residential and non residential commercial real estate properties 
personal household loans include loans to certain high net worth individuals for commercial purposes  in addition to consumer loans 
loans held for sale are those loans originated by our mortgage warehouse group 
loans extended to borrowers within the contracting industry are comprised largely of loans to land developers and to both heavy construction and general commercial contractors 
many of these loans are secured by real estate properties  the development of which is or may be financed by our bank 
loans extended to borrowers within the petrochemical and mining industries are predominantly loans to finance the exploration and production of petroleum and natural gas 
these loans are generally secured by proven petroleum and natural gas reserves 
we make loans that are appropriately collateralized under our credit standards 
approximately of our funded loans are secured by collateral 
over of the real estate collateral is located in texas

table of contents the determination of collateral value is critically important when financing real estate 
as a result  obtaining current and objectively prepared appraisals is a major part of our underwriting and monitoring processes 
generally  our policy requires a new appraisal every three years 
however  in the current economic downturn where real estate values have been fluctuating rapidly  more current appraisals are obtained when warranted by conditions such as a borrower s deteriorating financial condition  their possible inability to perform on the loan  and the increased risks involved with reliance on the collateral value as sole repayment of the loan 
generally  loans graded substandard or worse where real estate is a material portion of the collateral value and or the income from the real estate or sale of the real estate is the primary source of debt service  annual appraisals are obtained 
in all cases  appraisals are reviewed to determine reasonableness of the appraised value 
the reviewer will challenge whether or not the data used is adequate and relevant  form an opinion as to the appropriateness of the appraisal methods and techniques used  and determine if overall the analysis and conclusions of the appraiser can be relied upon 
both the appraisal process and the appraisal review process have become increasingly difficult in the current economic environment with the lack of comparable sales which is partially as a result of the lack of available financing which has ultimately led to overall depressed real estate values 
large credit relationships the market areas we serve include the five major metropolitan markets of texas  including austin  dallas  fort worth  houston and san antonio 
as a result  we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous customers in the ordinary course of business 
the legal limit of our bank is approximately million and our house limit is generally to million 
we consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million 
the following table provides additional information on our large credit relationships outstanding at year end in thousands number of period end balances number of period end balances relationships committed outstanding relationships committed outstanding large credit relationships million and greater million to million growth in outstanding balances related to large credit relationships primarily resulted from an increase in commitments 
the average commitment per large credit relationship in excess of million totaled million at december  and million at december  the average outstanding balance per large credit relationship with a commitment greater than million totaled at december  and million at december  the average commitment per large credit relationship between million and million totaled million at december  and million at december  the average outstanding balance per large credit relationship with a commitment between million and million totaled million at december  and million at december  
table of contents loan maturity and interest rate sensitivity on december  remaining maturities of selected loans in thousands total within year years after years loan maturity commercial construction real estate consumer equipment leases total loans held for investment interest rate sensitivity for selected loans with predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total loans held for investment interest reserve loans as of december   we had million in loans with interest reserves  which represents approximately of our construction loans 
loans with interest reserves are common when originating construction loans  but the use of interest reserves is carefully controlled by our underwriting standards 
the use of interest reserves is based on the feasibility of the project  the creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors  and the loan to value coverage of the collateral 
the interest reserve account allows the borrower  when financial conditions precedents are met to draw loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of the loan 
when drawn  the interest is capitalized and added to the loan balance  subject to conditions specified at the time the credit is approved and during the initial underwriting 
we have effective and ongoing controls for monitoring compliance with loan covenants for advancing funds and determination of default conditions 
when lending relationships involve financing of land on which improvements will be constructed  construction funds are not advanced until borrower has received lease or purchase commitments which will meet cash flow coverage requirements 
we maintain current financial statements on the borrowing entity and guarantors  as well as periodical inspections of the project and analysis of whether the project is on schedule or delayed 
updated appraisals are ordered when necessary to validate the collateral values to support all advances  including reserve interest 
advances of interest reserves are discontinued if collateral values do not support the advances or if the borrower does not comply with other terms and conditions in the loan agreements 
in addition  most of our construction lending is performed in texas and our lenders are very familiar with trends in local real estate 
at a point where we believe that our collateral position is jeopardized  we retain the right to stop the use of the interest reserves 
as of december  million of our loans with interest reserves were on nonaccrual  and in all cases  the use of the reserves has been suspended 

table of contents non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans and equipment leases  accruing loans or more days past due  restructured loans  and other repossessed assets 
the table below summarizes our non accrual loans by type in thousands year ended december non accrual loans commercial construction real estate consumer equipment leases total non accrual loans other repossessed assets oreo other repossessed assets total other repossessed assets total non performing assets loans past due days and accruing the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due  which is generally when a loan is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed 
interest income is subsequently recognized on a cash basis as long as the remaining unpaid principal amount of the loan is deemed to be fully collectible 
if collectibility is questionable  then cash payments are applied to principal 
if these loans had been current throughout their terms  interest and fees on loans would have increased by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   and  loans past due days and still accruing includes premium finance loans of million  million and million  respectively 
these loans are generally secured by obligations of insurance carriers to refund premiums on cancelled insurance policies 
the refund of premiums from the insurance carriers can take days or longer from the cancellation date 
at december   and  non performing assets include million  million  million  respectively  of mortgage warehouse loans which were transferred to our loans held for investment portfolio at lower of cost or market during the past eighteen months  and some were subsequently moved to oreo 
at december   oreo balance is net of million valuation allowance 
nonperforming assets include non accrual loans  restructured loans and repossessed assets 
total nonperforming assets at december  increased million from december   compared to million at december  the increases in the past two years are reflective of the overall economic deterioration during and as a result our allowance for loans losses as a percentage of loans  as well as our provision for credit losses recorded in and have increased 
at december   our total non accrual loans were million 
of these  million were characterized as commercial loans 
this included a million line of credit secured by single family residences and the borrower s notes receivable  a million line of credit secured by various single family properties  a million residence rehabilitation loan secured by single family residences  a million manufacturing loan secured by the assets of the borrower  a million loan secured by a first lien security 
table of contents interest in the borrower s accounts receivable and assets  a million loan secured by the borrower s assets  a million lender finance loan secured by the borrower s material assets and million in auto dealer loans secured by the borrower s accounts receivable and inventory 
non accrual loans also included million characterized as construction loans 
this included a million commercial real estate lot development loan secured by residential lots  a million commercial real estate loan secured by condominiums  a million commercial real estate loan secured by unimproved land  a million commercial real estate loan secured by retail property  million in commercial real estate loans secured by single family residences  million in residential real estate loans secured by single family residences and a million real estate investment loan secured by unimproved lots 
non accrual loans also included million characterized as real estate loans  of which relates to a real estate loan secured by an apartment building 
also included in this category are million in single family mortgages that were originated in our mortgage warehouse operation 
each of these loans were reviewed for impairment and specific reserves were allocated as necessary and included in the allowance for loan losses as of december  to cover any probable loss 
reserves on impaired loans were million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we recognized  in interest income on non accrual loans during compared to  in and  in additional interest income that would have been recorded if the loans had been current during the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
generally  we place loans on non accrual when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due  which is generally when a loan is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed 
interest income is subsequently recognized on a cash basis as long as the remaining unpaid principal amount of the loan is deemed to be fully collectible 
if collectibility is questionable  then cash payments are applied to principal 
as of december   none of our non accrual loans were earning on a cash basis 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the terms of the original loan agreement 
reserves on impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
restructured loans are loans on which  due to the borrower s financial difficulties  we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider 
this may include a transfer of real estate or other assets from the borrower  a modification of loan terms  or a combination of the two 
modifications of terms that could potentially qualify as a restructuring include reduction of contractual interest rate  extension of the maturity date at a contractual interest rate lower than the current rate for new debt with similar risk  or a reduction of the face amount of debt  either forgiveness of principal or accrued interest 
as of december  we have no loans considered restructured that are not already on nonaccrual 
of the nonaccrual loans at december   million met the criteria for restructured 
a loan continues to qualify as restructured until a consistent payment history has been evidenced  generally no less than twelve months 
a loan is placed back on accrual status when both principal and interest are current and it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due both principal and interest according to the terms of the loan agreement 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms  but for which we have concerns about the borrower s ability to comply with repayment terms because of the borrower s potential financial difficulties 
we monitor these loans closely and review their performance on a regular basis 
at december  and  we had million and million in loans of this type  which were not included in either the non accrual or days past due categories 
the increase in the amount of potential problem loans from december to december is consistent with the overall economic deterioration and the increase in nonperforming loans that we have experienced this year 

table of contents the table below presents a summary of the activity related to oreo in thousands year ended december beginning balance additions sales valuation allowance direct write downs ending balance the million balance in oreo at december  included unimproved commercial real estate values at million and residential real estate lots and undeveloped land valued at million and million  respectively 
also included is a commercial real estate property consisting of single family residences and developed lots valued at million  unimproved commercial real estate lots valued at million and million  an office building valued at million  and commercial real estate property consisting of single family residences and a mix of lots at various levels of completion valued at million 
when foreclosure occurs  fair value  which is generally based on appraised values  may result in partial charge off of loan upon taking property  and so long as property is retained  reductions in appraised values will result in valuation adjustment taken as non interest expense 
in addition  if the decline in value is believed to be permanent and not just driven by market conditions  a direct write down to the oreo balance may be taken 
we generally pursue sales of oreo when conditions warrant  but we may choose to hold certain properties for a longer term  which can result in additional exposure related to the appraised values during that holding period 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in valuation expense 
of the million  million related to increases to the valuation allowance  and million related to direct write downs 
summary of loan loss experience the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level consistent with management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio in light of current economic conditions and market trends 
we recorded a provision of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the amount of reserves and provision required to support the reserve have increased over the last two years as a result of credit deterioration in our loan portfolio driven by negative changes in national and regional economic conditions and the impact on those conditions on the financial condition of borrowers and the values of assets  including real estate assets  pledged as collateral 
the reserve for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves for impaired loans and an estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date  but not yet identified with specified loans 
we regularly evaluate our reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb estimated loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors contributing to the determination of reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral  and general economic conditions 
all loan commitments rated substandard or worse and greater than  are specifically reviewed for impairment 
for loans deemed to be impaired  a specific allocation is assigned based on the losses expected to be realized from those loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
credit grades are assigned to all loans 
each credit grade is assigned a risk factor  or reserve allocation percentage 
these risk factors are multiplied by the outstanding principal balance and risk weighted by product type to calculate the required reserve 
a similar process is employed to calculate a reserve assigned to off balance sheet commitments  specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
even though portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 

table of contents the reserve allocation percentages assigned to each credit grade have been developed based primarily on an analysis of our historical loss rates 
the allocations are adjusted for certain qualitative factors for such things as general economic conditions  changes in credit policies and lending standards 
changes in the trend and severity of problem loans can cause the estimation of losses to differ from past experience 
in addition  the reserve considers the results of reviews performed by independent third party reviewers as reflected in their confirmations of assigned credit grades within the portfolio 
the portion of the allowance that is not derived by the allowance allocation percentages compensates for the uncertainty and complexity in estimating loan and lease losses including factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination and application of the allowance allocation percentages 
we evaluate many factors and conditions in determining the unallocated portion of the allowance  including the economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends and general growth in the portfolio 
the allowance is considered adequate and appropriate  given management s assessment of potential losses within the portfolio as of the evaluation date  the significant growth in the loan and lease portfolio  current economic conditions in the company s market areas and other factors 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and anticipated future credit losses 
the changes are reflected in the general reserve and in specific reserves as the collectability of larger classified loans is evaluated with new information 
as our portfolio has matured  historical loss ratios have been closely monitored  and our reserve adequacy relies primarily on our loss history 
currently  the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to our board of directors for their review  consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for credit losses  which includes a liability for losses on unfunded commitments  totaled million at december   million at december  and million at december  the total reserve percentage increased to at year end from and of loans held for investment at december  and  respectively 
the total reserve percentage has increased over the past two years as a result of the effects of national and regional economic conditions on borrowers and values of assets pledged as collateral 
these changes in economic conditions have resulted in increases in loans with weakened credit quality and nonperforming loans 
the overall reserve for loan losses continues to be driven by the loan loss reserve methodology as described above 
at december   we believe the reserve is sufficient to cover all expected losses in the portfolio and has been derived from consistent application of the methodology described above 
should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses change  our estimate of expected losses in the portfolio could also change  which would affect the level of future provisions for loan losses

table of contents the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when there is a clear indication that the borrower s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due  which is generally when a loan is days past due 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed 
interest income is subsequently recognized on a cash basis as long as the remaining unpaid principal amount of the loan is deemed to be fully collectible 
if collectibility is questionable  then cash payments are applied to principal 
if these loans had been current throughout their terms  interest and fees on loans would have increased by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

loan loss reserve allocation december in thousands  except percentage data reserve of loans reserve of loans reserve of loans reserve of loans reserve of loans loan category commercial construction real estate consumer equipment leases unallocated total includes loans held for sale 
during  the reserve allocated to all categories of loans increased compared to primarily due to increases in the level of allocations required by our loan loss reserve methodology 
generally  loan loss reserve allocations between categories are consistent with prior year 
the percentage of the reserve allocated to construction is a slightly higher percentage in the current year even though the percentage of our loans in that category has decreased from prior year 
this increase in construction reserve allocation is related to the overall economic downturn and decreased values that have been experienced with construction projects  most especially lot development projects 
this is also consistent with the increase in nonperforming loans in this category we ve experienced in securities portfolio securities are identified as either held to maturity or available for sale based upon various factors  including asset liability management strategies  liquidity and profitability objectives  and regulatory requirements 
held to maturity securities are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts 
available for sale securities are securities that may be sold prior to maturity based upon asset liability management decisions 
securities identified as available for sale are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity  net of taxes

our objective in managing our liquidity is to maintain our ability to meet loan commitments  purchase securities or repay deposits and other liabilities in accordance with their terms  without an adverse impact on our current or future earnings 
our liquidity strategy is guided by policies  which are formulated and monitored by our senior management and our balance sheet management committee bsmc  and which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
we regularly evaluate all of our various funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility  stability  reliability and cost effectiveness 
for the years ended december  and  our principal source of funding has been our customer deposits  supplemented by short term borrowings primarily from federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
since early  our liquidity needs have primarily been fulfilled through growth in our core customer deposits and supplemented with brokered deposits and borrowings as needed 
our goal is to obtain as much of our funding as possible from deposits of these core customers  which as of december   comprised  million  or  of total deposits  compared to  million  or  of total deposits  at december  on an average basis  for the year ended december   deposits from core customers comprised  million  or  of total annual average deposits 
these deposits are generated

critical accounting policies sec guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents we follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the more significant of these policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
however  the policy noted below could be deemed to meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies 
management considers the policies related to the allowance for loan losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation 
the total allowance for loan losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  receivables  and asc  contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to current earnings 
the amount maintained in the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific reserves assigned to certain classified loans and general reserves 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the credit worthiness of the borrower  and more specifically  changes in the expected future receipt of principal and interest payments and or in the value of pledged collateral 
a reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
for purposes of determining the general reserve  the portfolio is segregated by product types in order to recognize differing risk profiles among categories  and then further segregated by credit grades 
see summary of loan loss experience for further discussion of the risk factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
new accounting standards see note new accounting standards in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices 
additionally  the financial instruments subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading purposes or held for other than trading 
we are subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on our portfolio of assets held for purposes other than trading 
the effect of other changes  such as foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to us 
the responsibility for managing market risk rests with the bsmc  which operates under policy guidelines established by our board of directors 
the negative acceptable variation in net interest revenue due to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates is generally limited by these guidelines to 
these guidelines also establish maximum levels for short term borrowings  short term assets and public and brokered deposits 
they also establish minimum levels for unpledged assets  among other things 
compliance with these guidelines is the ongoing responsibility of the bsmc  with exceptions reported to our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
interest rate risk management our interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions as of december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap asset sensitive  where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment 
a negative 
table of contents gap liability sensitive will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows

the table above sets forth the balances as of december  for interest bearing assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the total of non interest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
while a gap interest table is useful in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  an interest rate sensitivity simulation provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
earnings are also affected by the effects of changing interest rates on the value of funding derived from demand deposits and stockholders equity 
we perform a sensitivity analysis to identify interest rate risk exposure on net interest income 
we quantify and measure interest rate risk exposure using a model to dynamically simulate the effect of changes in net interest income relative to changes in interest rates and account balances over the next twelve months based on three interest rate scenarios 
these are a most likely rate scenario and two shock test scenarios 
the most likely rate scenario is based on the consensus forecast of future interest rates published by independent sources 
these forecasts incorporate future spot rates and relevant spreads of instruments that 
table of contents are actively traded in the open market 
the federal reserve s federal funds target affects short term borrowing  the prime lending rate and the libor are the basis for most of our variable rate loan pricing 
the year mortgage rate is also monitored because of its effect on prepayment speeds for mortgage backed securities 
these are our primary interest rate exposures 
we are currently not using derivatives to manage our interest rate exposure 
the two shock test scenarios assume a sustained parallel basis point increase or decrease  respectively  in interest rates 
as short term rates continued to fall during and  we could not assume interest rate changes of any amount as the results of the decreasing rates scenario would not be meaningful 
we will continue to evaluate these scenarios as interest rates change  until short term rates rise above 
our interest rate risk exposure model incorporates assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminable maturity deposits demand deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
changes in prepayment behavior of mortgage backed securities  residential and commercial mortgage loans in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
the impact of planned growth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model 
this modeling indicated interest rate sensitivity as follows in thousands anticipated impact over the next twelve months as compared to most likely scenario bp increase bp increase december  december  change in net interest income the simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics  future cash flows and customer behavior 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors
