on july   the merger of meadowbrook insurance group  inc and procentury corporation procentury was completed merger 
under the terms of the merger agreement  procentury shareholders were entitled to receive  for each procentury common share  either in cash or meadowbrook common stock based on a exchange ratio  subject to adjustment as described within the merger agreement 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the stock price used in determining the final cash and share consideration portion of the purchase price was based on the volume weighted average sales price of a share meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued of meadowbrook common stock for the day trading period ending on the sixth trading day before the completion of the merger  or 
based upon the proration  the total purchase price was million  of which million consisted of cash  million in newly issued common stock  and approximately million in transaction related costs 
the total number of common shares issued for purposes of the stock portion of the purchase price was million shares 
procentury is a specialty insurance company  which primarily underwrites general liability  commercial property  environmental  garage  commercial multi peril  commercial auto  surety  and marine insurance primarily in the excess and surplus lines  or non admitted  market through a select group of general agents 
the excess and surplus lines market provides insurance coverage for customers with hard to place risks that standard or admitted insurers typically choose not to insure 
five months of earnings of procentury are included in our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  twelve months of earnings are included as of and for the year ended december  since the completion of the merger  we have been executing on numerous revenue enhancement opportunities and leveraging the infrastructure as summarized below revenue enhancement opportunities launching a new wholesale relationship in the midwest  offering a surplus lines market need for an existing workers compensation partner in new england  and utilization of existing program capabilities for century general agents 
leveraging shared infrastructure and increased size  developing centers of expertise for claims management increased size and diversity benefit costs of reinsurance  enhanced marketing capabilities through joint business development functions  and geographic expansion of century offerings through existing admitted markets 
executing on opportunities to leverage other niche capabilities combined capabilities allow us to receive and evaluate more opportunities  and independently  neither company would have been able to meet the comprehensive risk management solutions that some opportunities require 
specialty insurance operations our specialty insurance operations segment  which includes insurance company specialty programs and fee for service specialty or managed programs  focuses on specialty or niche insurance business 
our specialty insurance operations provide services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability  commercial auto liability  excess and surplus lines  environmental  garage  surety  legal  professional liability  errors and omissions  inland marine  and other lines of business  where we see a market need and a profit potential 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agents 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages the meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued specialty insurance operations provides within seven categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  and net realized gains losses 
we included the results of operations related to procentury within the specialty insurance operations 
therefore  specialty insurance operations include five months of results for procentury for the year ended december  and twelve months of results for the year ended december  in addition  our subsidiary  star  purchased a ownership interest in an insurance holding limited liability company 
this ownership interest is significant  but is less than a majority ownership and  therefore  is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
star  therefore  will recognize of the profits and losses as a result of this equity interest ownership 
for segment reporting purposes  the equity earnings related to this investment is shown gross of tax 
equity earnings of affiliates  relates to our proportionate share of this investment  which we consider to be consistent with our specialty insurance operations and  therefore  we have included the respective equity earnings within the specialty insurance operations segment 
with a fee for service or managed program  we earn revenue by providing certain operational and administrative functions and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results of the program 
the fees we receive from these programs are generally either a fixed amount or based on a percentage of premium serviced or claim count 
based upon the particular risk management goals of our clients  market conditions and our assessment of the opportunity for operating profit  our specialty insurance operations offer solutions on a fully insured basis  a risk sharing basis  or a managed basis  in response to a specific market opportunity 
in a managed program  we earn service fee revenue by providing certain operational functions and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results 
in a risk sharing program  we share the operating results with the client through a reinsurance agreement with an insurance company  captive  or rent a captive 
in a profit sharing structure  we pay an agent a commission that is adjusted based on the operating results of the program 
these structures  other than the profit sharing commission structure  are licensed insurance or reinsurance companies and are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to reinsurance and insurance products 
in risk sharing programs  we derive revenue from net earned premiums  fee for service revenue and commissions  and investment income 
in addition  we may benefit from the fees our risk management subsidiary earns for services we perform on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries 
these fees are eliminated upon consolidation 
however  the fees associated with the captive s portion of the program are reimbursed through a ceding commission 
for a fully insured program  we provide insurance products without a risk bearing mechanism and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
for further descriptions of our insurance programs and products refer to the business section 
in addition to premium revenue and investment income from our net retained portion of the operating results  we may also be compensated through the receipt of fees for policy issuance services and acquisition costs  captive administration  reinsurance placement  loss prevention services  and claims administrative and handling services 
in addition  we may benefit from the fees our risk management subsidiary earns for services we perform on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries 
these fees are eliminated upon consolidation 
however  the fees associated with the captive s portion of the program are reimbursed through a ceding commission 
for financial reporting purposes  ceding commissions are treated as a reduction in underwriting expenses 
with fully insured programs  we provide our insurance products without a risk bearing mechanism and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are generally developed in response to specific market opportunities and may evolve into a risk sharing arrangement 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued agency operations we earn commission revenue through the operation of our retail property and casualty insurance agencies  located in michigan  california  and florida 
the agency operations produce commercial  personal lines  life  and accident and health insurance  for more than fifty unaffiliated insurance carriers 
the agency produces an immaterial amount of business for our affiliated insurance company subsidiaries 
in recent years  we have derived our revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized losses gains specialty insurance operations agency operations holding company interest income earned intersegment revenue consolidated revenue critical accounting policies general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represents case based estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued million and million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued components of losses and loss adjustment expense the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed retroceded assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business allocated to individual insurance company writers based on the insurer s market share in a given state 
the reserves referenced in the above table related to our direct and assumed business  which we directly manage and are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
accordingly  the case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no delay or lag in reporting of losses from a ceding company  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag between the date of the evaluation and the receipt of the estimate from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  and include an estimated reserve based upon actuarial methods for this lag 
assumed business  that is subsequently retroceded to participating reinsurers  relates to business previously discontinued and now is in run off 
relative to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received from cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total claim reserving process and methodology when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  which focus on the ultimate probable cost of each reported claim  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
in developing claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates  we perform a complete and detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform this analysis  the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it may be a particular geographical area within a line of business such as nevada workers compensation 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as either short tail or long tail 
about of our reserves can be characterized as coming from long tail lines of business 
for long tail business  several years may lapse between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
our long tail exposures include workers compensation  commercial automobile liability  general liability  professional liability  products liability  excess  and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  a portion of ocean marine  and inland marine 
the analyses generally review losses both gross and net of reinsurance 
the standard actuarial methods that we use to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method incurred development method paid bornhuetter ferguson method reported bornhuetter ferguson method initial expected loss method paid roll forward method meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued incurred roll forward method construction defect method all of these methods are consistently applied to every reserve category where they are applicable and they create indications for each accident year 
we use judgment selecting the best estimate from within these estimates or adjusted estimates 
as such  no one method or group of methods is strictly used for any line of business or reserve category within a line of business 
the individual selections by year are our best judgments based on the strengths and weaknesses of the method  indications  the inherent variability in the data and the specific modifications to selections for data characteristics 
a brief description of the methods and some discussion of their inherent strengths  weaknesses and uses are as follows paid development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
incurred development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment and case reserving environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
since the method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place  and the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on adjusting prior accident year projections to the current accident year levels using underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments specific to the line of business 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
paid roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual paid loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it is useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns 
incurred roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual case incurred loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it may also be useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns and generally reacts faster than the paid roll forward method 
claims for short tail lines of business settle more quickly than long tail lines of business  and in general  loss development factors for short tail lines are smaller than long tail lines 
for long tail lines  we tend to rely on initial expected loss methods throughout the current accident year then move to development factor based methods for older accident years 
development methods on short tail lines are generally reliable in the third and fourth quarter of the initial accident year and recorded loss ratios reflect a blend of the development and forecast methods 
short tail lines represent of our total reserves at december  construction defect method 
the provision for ibnr loss and alae for construction defect claims is analyzed by projecting the number of ibnr claim counts and applying a selected severity ie  a frequency severity type approach 
the provision for development on reported claims is projected using a methodology similar to the incurred loss development approach described above 
however  the claims are organized in a report year rather than accident year format 
the advantage of this is that it substantially reduces the length or tail of the development 
the reserve categories where the above methods are not applicable are few 
the largest of these is our workers compensation residual market reserve category  where we utilize detailed reserve analyses performed by the industry statistical agency ncci in making our estimates 
we adjust these estimates for timing differences in the reporting of the data 
the other reserve categories that deviate from the above methods are smaller  as a group constituting approximately one percent of the total reserves 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
for all but the initial expected loss method  the key assumptions are the patterns with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time development patterns 
these patterns incorporate inherent assumptions of claims cost inflation rates and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
these are affected by underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments which are explicit key assumptions underlying the initial expected loss method 
each of these key assumptions is discussed in the following paragraphs 
to analyze the development patterns  we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical development patterns 
to the extent that the historical data may provide insufficient information about future patterns whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rating bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our insurance companies historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the reserve for losses and lae at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  the new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop for many years and at times  decades in the future 
when it is likely the actual development will occur in the distant future  the potential for actual development to differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections is increased 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
in particular  the development factor based methods all have as a key assumption that the development of losses in the future will follow a pattern similar to those measured by past experience and as adjusted either explicitly or by actuarial judgment 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple and varied factors 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and variability of claim reserve estimates by its nature  the estimate of ultimate losses and lae is subject to variability due to differences between our assumptions and actual events in the future 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate the values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of the future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analyses to perform the necessary adjustments 
one implicit assumption underlying development patterns is that the claims inflation trends will continue into the future similar to their past patterns 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  our actuarial department derives expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary variance of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
general inflation trends have been fairly stable over the past several years but there have been fluctuations of one to two percent over the past ten years and therefore we used a one percent annual inflation variance factor 
the effect differed by line of business but overall was a three percent change in reserve adequacy or approximately million effect on after tax net income 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
an explicit assumption used in the analysis is the set of initial expected loss ratios ielrs used in the current accident year reserve projections and in some of the prior accident year ultimate loss indications 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss to a change in ielrs  the actuarial department recasted the loss reserve indications using a set of ielrs all one percent higher than the final ielrs 
the overall impact of a one percent change in ielrs would be a corresponding one percent change in reserve adequacy or a million effect on after tax net income 
often the loss ratios by line of business will vary from the ielr in different directions causing them to partially offset each other 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
the other factors having influence upon the loss and lae reserve levels are too numerous and interdependent to efficiently model and test for sensitivity 
likewise  the development factors by reserve category and age are too numerous to model and test for sensitivity 
instead  ranges are estimated by reserve category considering past history  fluctuations in the development patterns  emerging issues  trends and other factors 
the ranges are compiled and the total range is estimated considering the sensitivity to all of the underlying factors together 
the resulting range is our best estimate of the expected ongoing variability in the loss reserves 
historic development as shown within the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development table has been six percent or less in the last five years but was ten to seventeen percent in the years prior to the underwriting and reserving shift in at that time  we concentrated our efforts on eliminating underwriting relationships where we had substantial liabilities above an aggregate exposure retained by risk sharing associations and captives 
for a large share of our business  we also accelerated the pace at which we brought the claim administration to our employees and away from outside third party administrators 
this change enabled us to more rapidly recognize trends and underlying loss patterns  and establish more accurate reserves in a timely manner 
our range of loss and lae reserves table shows that presently we estimate them as going from favorable development of to unfavorable of 
the range was evaluated based on the ultimate loss estimates from the actuarial methods described above 
pre tax impact on earnings from a variance in future loss payments and case reserves as of december  in thousands line of business minimum reserve range maximum reserve range workers compensation including residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the sensitivity around our workers compensation reserves primarily reflects the size and the maturity of the underlying book of business 
our workers compensation reserves represent of our total reserves at december  the sensitivity around our commercial multiple peril general liability reserves primarily reflects the longer duration of reserves relating to our liability excess program  which started in  and construction defect exposure  which together represent approximately of the million reserves in this line of business as of december  these lines of business are subject to greater uncertainty than the remainder of our book of business 
the sensitivity around our commercial automobile reserves primarily reflects the speed of reporting of the underlying losses  as well as the maturity of the case law surrounding automobile liability 
the sensitivity around the other lines of business primarily reflects the size of the underlying book of business 
our other reserves represent of total reserves at december  a large portion of these reserves represent professional liability programs which tend to be claims made and reinsured at lower limits  therefore reducing the volatility that is inherent in a smaller book of business 
another large portion represents property claims  which have a shorter reporting and payout pattern than liability and workers compensation claims 
all of our reserves are sensitive to changes in the underlying claim payment and case reserving practices  as well as the other sources of variations mentioned above 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which may be in dispute 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations

management s discussion and analysis continued investments our investment securities are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities that are not determined to be other than temporary impaired otti are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes and  accordingly have no effect on net income 
realized gains or losses on sale of investments are determined on the basis of specific costs of the investments 
dividend income is recognized when declared and interest income is recognized when earned 
discount or premium on debt securities purchased at other than par value is amortized using the effective yield method 
available for sale securities are reviewed for declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary 
for a debt security  if we intend to sell a security and it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis and the fair value of the debt security is below amortized cost  we conclude that an otti impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value  with a corresponding charge to realized loss in the consolidated statements of income 
if we do not intend to sell a debt security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the debt security referred to as the credit loss  we conclude that an otti has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss in the consolidated statements of income  as this is also deemed the credit portion of the otti 
the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income as an unrealized non credit otti in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
when assessing our intent to sell a debt security and if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a debt security before recovery of our cost basis  facts and circumstances such as  but not limited to  decisions to reposition our security portfolio  sale of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to capitalize on favorable pricing  are evaluated 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a debt security  we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows expected to be recovered 
the discount rate is the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying debt security upon issuance 
the effective interest rate is the original yield or the coupon if the debt security was previously impaired 
if an otti exists and there is not sufficient cash flows or other information to determine a recovery value of the security  we conclude that the entire otti is credit related and the amortized cost for the security is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss in the consolidated statements of income 
to determine the recovery period of a debt security  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including  but not limited to the following historical and implied volatility of the security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  conditions specifically related to the security such as default rates  loss severities  loan to value ratios  current levels of subordination  third party guarantees  and vintage  specific conditions in an industry or geographic area  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued failure  if any  of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments  and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
in periods subsequent to the recognition of an otti  the security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the otti 
therefore  for a fixed maturity security  the discount or reduced premium is reflected in net investment income over the contractual term of the investment in a manner that produces a constant effective yield 
for an equity security  if we do not have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery in value  we conclude that an otti has occurred  and the cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value  with a corresponding charge to realized loss within the consolidated statements of income 
when assessing our ability and intent to hold the equity security to recovery  we consider  among other things  the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security  as well as the cause of decline  a fundamental analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer 
revenue recognition we account for our reinsurance and insurance products in accordance with accounting standards codification asc financial services insurance 
premiums written  which include direct  assumed  and ceded premiums are recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the life of the policy term 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
provisions for unearned premiums on reinsurance assumed from others are made on the basis of ceding reports when received and actuarial estimates 
assumed premium estimates are specifically related to the mandatory assumed pool business from the ncci  or residual market business 
the pools cede workers compensation business to participating companies based upon the individual company s market share by state 
the activity is reported from the ncci to participating companies on a two quarter lag 
to accommodate this lag  we estimate premium and loss activity based on historical and market based results 
historically  we have not experienced any material difficulties or disputes in collecting balances from ncci  and therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts is recorded related to the assumed premium estimate 
fee income  which includes risk management consulting  loss control  and claims services  is recognized during the period the services are provided 
depending on the terms of the contract  claims processing fees are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the claims  or the estimated life of the contract 
for those contracts that provide services beyond the expiration or termination of the contract  fees are deferred in an amount equal to management s estimate of our obligation to continue to provide services in the future 
commission income  which includes reinsurance placement  is recorded on the later of the effective date or the billing date of the policies on which they were earned 
commission income is reported net of any sub producer commission expense 
any commission adjustments that occur subsequent to the earnings process are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
profit sharing commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
we review  on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of our receivables and establish an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
as of december  and  the allowance for uncollectibles on receivables was million and million  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued equity earnings of affiliates equity earnings represent investments in affiliates in which we do not exercise control and have a or more voting interest 
such investments in affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
we have an equity interest in one affiliate  and the equity earnings of this interest were recorded in net income 
equity earnings  net of tax  for were  we had no equity earnings related to this affiliate for and we did not receive any dividends from this affiliate in additionally  we are recording the equity earnings in this affiliate based on a month lag due to timing differences in respect to the availability of information  as permissible under fasb asc  investments equity method and joint ventures subsequent measurement 
legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by the policy at issue  errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
in accordance with accounting guidance  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  an accrual is provided for the costs to resolve these claims in our consolidated accompanying financial statements 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
goodwill we evaluate existing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of october st  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill impairment is performed at the reporting unit level 
to test goodwill for impairment  we are required to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for our reporting units  other valuation techniques are used 
we have developed a model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation technique dcf model 
a dcf model is selected to be comparable to what would be used by market participants to estimate fair value 
the impairment test incorporates estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets  liabilities and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates  terminal value amounts  and the applicable weighted average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows 
these estimates are based on management s judgment 
the estimates and projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with our forecast and long range plans 
in accordance with accounting guidance  we concluded our reporting units to be agency operations and specialty insurance operations 
the nature of the business and economic characteristics of all agency operations and all specialty insurance operations are similar based upon  but not limited to  the following  management alignment within each reporting unit  our insurance company subsidiaries operate under a meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reinsurance pooling arrangement  and our ability to leverage our expertise and fixed costs within each reporting unit 
deferred policy acquisition costs commissions and other costs of acquiring insurance business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they relate 
investment earnings are anticipated in determining the recoverability of such deferred amounts 
we reduce these costs for premium deficiencies 
there were no premium deficiencies for the years ended december   and federal income taxes we provide for federal income taxes based on amounts we believe we ultimately will owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  we may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of income 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
results of operations executive overview our results for the full year include the positive impact from continued selective growth  coupled with our adherence to strict corporate underwriting guidelines  as well as a focus on current accident year price adequacy  and the benefits derived from leveraging our fixed costs 
our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from in net operating income  excluding amortization  increased to million  compared to million in our year to date results included a pre tax loss of million related to impairment charges on our investment portfolio 
this is down from a pre tax loss of million in  which were also related to impairment charges 
in september  at the height of the economy s financial crisis  we experienced losses primarily in preferred stock investments in fannie mae  freddie mac  lehman brothers  and gmac 
our exposure to unrealized losses and other than temporarily impaired securities decreased during  as the financial markets began to stabilize and improve 
the impairments primarily consisted of asset backed securities with rising default rates  declining prepayment speeds  and increasing loss severity of collateral value 
in addition  this impairment charge also included a few corporate securities where the issuer experienced deteriorating business conditions and results  which put pressure on its valuation and  to a lesser extent  further deterioration in preferred stock securities 
offsetting the impairment charges in  were pre tax realized gains of million that we recognized in the fourth quarter of from the sale of certain securities which were sold for tax planning purposes 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued our investment portfolio as of december   includes pre tax net unrealized gains of million  or a book value per share  compared to pre tax net unrealized gains of million in  or a book value per share 
after tax net unrealized gains were million  or a book value per share  compared to after tax net unrealized gains of million  or a book value per share in our conservative investment philosophy  which focuses on a high quality  short duration investments with both diversifications in specific securities  as well as investment sectors  has minimized our asset risk in relation to our gaap equity 
gross written premium increased million  or  to million  compared to million in included in this increase was million in gross written premiums related to our century surety company century operations 
in addition  this increase includes million in gross written premiums related to our new relationship with a program agent who specializes in non contractors workers compensation in the midwest  california  and other western states  as well as new programs which include a general agent that focuses on the food services industry and a general agent who focuses on heterogeneous workers compensation in the southeast region of the united states 
the increase is also a result of growth in new business from programs implemented in and we anticipate further growth during as the annualized premiums of these programs continue to be realized 
in addition  we continue to experience selective growth within existing programs consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy 
while the level of rate decreases has slowed  we have seen a continued competitive market 
along with the recession  there has been downward pressure on revenue growth  but a decrease in frequency of losses has helped to support underwriting profitability 
with as our first full year of operations after the merger with procentury  we continue to see opportunities emerge as we use our admitted market capabilities to expand our footprint with century s wholesale agents in areas including marine  garage  and workers compensation  and as we roll out surplus lines products through an existing agent in markets not previously serviced by procentury  and as we continue to leverage costs by creating economies of scale for purchasing reinsurance and managing the back office operations 
by utilizing the capabilities of our combined company  we have also begun underwriting environmental related risks 
century s environmental expertise has now been combined with the existing workers compensation and automobile liability platform to provide an integrated program for environmental risks 
the standard surety operation for century is now being marketed as star surety to take advantage of the higher treasury listing and broader licensing and filing capabilities of star 
the combined platform has expanded agent relationships and rounded out agency relationship needs  which should grow both our programs and products 
in july  our subsidiary  star  purchased a ownership interest in an insurance holding limited liability company for million in cash 
this ownership interest is significant  but is less than a majority ownership and  therefore  is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
star  therefore  will recognize of the profits and losses as a result of this equity interest ownership 
on june   we announced the affirmation of am best company s financial strength rating of a excellent for our insurance company subsidiaries 
compared to net income for the year ended december   increased  or million to million  or per dilutive share  compared to net income of million  or per dilutive share  for the comparable period of net operating income  a non gaap measure  increased million  or  to million  or per dilutive share  compared to net operating income of million  or per dilutive share for the comparable period in  with lower weighted average shares outstanding 
total diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  were meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued compared to  for the comparable period in this increase in the weighted average shares is primarily the result of the equity issued in connection with the procentury merger 
net income for the year ended december   included net after tax realized losses of  or per diluted share  which consisted of other than temporary impairments primarily related to certain asset backed securities  corporate bonds  and preferred stocks  which were primarily offset by the previously mentioned realized gains recognized in the fourth quarter of for tax planning purposes 
the net after tax realized losses of  or per diluted share  compares to after tax realized losses of million  or per diluted share in net investment income increased to million  primarily related to the increase in invested assets as a result of the procentury merger 
overall  we continue to see favorable prior accident year reserve development  as well as selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy 
net income for the year ended december   included after tax catastrophe losses of million related to hurricanes gustav and ike 
the favorable improvement within net income was slightly offset by lower net commission and fee revenue 
revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million increase in net earned premiums  of which million related to our century operations 
excluding the net earned premiums related to our century operations  the increase of million was primarily the result of overall growth within our existing programs and new business we implemented in and our overall net commission and fees were down  or million  as further explained below 
in addition  the revenues reflect a million increase in investment income  which primarily reflects the increase in invested assets as a result of the procentury merger  as well as continued positive cash flow from operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded pre tax and after tax equity earnings of million  or per share and  or per share respectively 
the equity earnings relate to our share of earnings relating to our ownership interest in an insurance holding limited liability company  as described above 
compared to net income for the year ended december   was million  or per dilutive share  compared to net income of million  or per dilutive share  for the comparable period of net operating income  a non gaap measure  increased million  or  to million  or per dilutive share  compared to net operating income of million  or per dilutive share for the comparable period in  with lower weighted average shares outstanding 
total weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the comparable period in this increase in the weighted average shares was primarily the result of the equity issued in connection with the procentury merger  as well as a full year impact of the shares issued in july related to our capital raise 
net income for the year ended december   was negatively impacted by after tax realized losses of million  or per diluted share  primarily as a result of the other than temporary impairments in certain preferred stock investments  which primarily related to freddie mac  fannie mae  and lehman brothers investments  but also included several corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  net income for the year included the after tax impact of catastrophe losses related to hurricanes gustav and ike of million  or per diluted share 
in addition  net income included amortization expense of million  compared to million in we experienced improvements in our expense ratio as we continued to benefit from the elimination of the fronting fees associated with our prior use of an unaffiliated insurance carrier s a rated policy forms 
our expense ratio also benefited by our ability to further leverage fixed costs in the management company 
in addition  net investment income increased to million 
somewhat offsetting the positive variables was a substantial increase in amortization expense meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued related to the acquisition of the ussu business in in addition  amortization expense increased due to the other intangibles acquired in the procentury merger 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflected a million increase in net earned premiums  of which million related to procentury 
excluding the net earned premiums related to procentury  the increase was primarily the result of overall growth within our existing programs and new business we began underwriting in and our overall net commissions and fees were down  or million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in fees related to our new england based programs  caused by a decrease in premium volume due to reduced rates in the self insured markets on which the fees are based  due to mandatory rate reductions and an increase in competition 
in addition  this decrease reflected slightly lower agency commission revenue  which resulted from more competitive pricing in certain jurisdictions 
in  we converted a portion of the policies produced by ussu to our insurance company subsidiaries 
the intercompany management fees associated with that portion of the underwritten policies of the ussu business that we brought in house were million for the year ended december  these fees are now eliminated upon consolidation  thereby lowering net commissions and fees  but not impacting overall consolidated results 
in addition  the revenues reflected a million increase in investment income  which primarily reflected the increase in invested assets acquired in the procentury merger 
the remaining increase in investment income was partially the result of overall positive cash flow and the net proceeds received from our equity offering in july slightly offsetting the increases was the million in realized losses  primarily related to the other than temporary impairments recorded in the last half of  as previously indicated

management s discussion and analysis continued net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase was the result of million in net earned premiums related to our century operations 
the remaining increase of million was primarily the result of growth within our existing programs and the new business we implemented in and management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily relates to two programs we previously managed where the client is now performing their own policy administration services 
this decrease is also due to an overall decrease in fees within our specialty program manager subsidiary  primarily as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  this decrease was the result of a decrease in fees in our new england based self insured programs  caused by a decrease in premium volume from continued competition and poor economic conditions 
claim fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily relates to a program we previously managed where the client is now performing their own claim administrative services 
in addition  this decrease is related to the loss of a specific workers compensation program and is also related to lower premium volumes related to self insured programs  which is the basis for the fee revenue 
net investment income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of million in net investment income related to procentury 
overall  invested assets increased due to the inclusion of procentury s invested assets from the merger of approximately million at july   coupled with the investing of positive cash flows from operations 
total cash flows from operations as of december  were million  compared to million in the positive cash flows from operations were primarily due to favorable underwriting results 
the average investment yield for december  was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was 
the current after tax book yield was  compared to in the duration of the investment portfolio is years at december   compared to years at december  specialty insurance operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the comparable period in this increase in pre tax income demonstrates a continued improvement in underwriting results including favorable reserve development on prior accident years  selective growth in premium  adherence to our strict underwriting guidelines  and our overall leveraging of fixed costs 
this improvement was also attributable to an increase in net investment income 
in addition  this improvement was attributable to an increase of million related to realized gains and losses 
pre tax realized losses for the year ended december  were  compared to a pre tax loss of million for the comparable period in the realized losses recognized in the year related to impairment charges related to specific securities as previously mentioned  offset by realized gains from sales of certain securities for tax planning purposes 
the realized loss in related to the other than temporary impairments recognized in the fourth quarter of  which related to securities within the investment portfolio acquired with the procentury merger 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in net loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
our accident year loss ratio  which is a non gaap measure  was in  compared to in an accident year loss ratio measures losses and lae occurring in a particular year  regardless of when they are reported and does not take into consideration changes in estimates in loss reserves from prior accident years 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued our accident year loss ratio is a good means of comparison to historical trends and current industry estimates 
we continue to see favorable development primarily resulting from within our general liability line of business due to lower frequency and severity and better than expected incurred and paid claims results 
to a lesser extent  we continue to experience favorable development in workers compensation  auto liability  and professional liability  slightly offset by unfavorable development in our excess liability line of business 
in addition  we revised our estimated claims handling costs through a comprehensive actual costs study  which increased favorable development within our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserve 
our results in included after tax catastrophe losses of million related to hurricanes gustav and ike 
additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
our expense ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
our overall leveraging of fixed costs has been somewhat offset by the higher level of internal costs and reductions in ceding commission  primarily related to a reduction in risk sharing partner participation and a reduction in the ceding commission rate within one particular line of business on a specific program 
in addition  the overall proportion of risk sharing programs in relation to our overall book of business has decreased as a result of the procentury merger 
in addition  higher average direct commission rates associated with century s business also contributed to the increase in the expense ratio  which includes twelve months of these costs for and only five months in the higher commissions were slightly offset by lower insurance related assessments 
as a surplus lines carrier  century is not subject to premium taxes on its non admitted business 
compared to revenues from specialty insurance operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase was primarily the result of million in net earned premiums related to procentury 
excluding the net earned premiums related to procentury  net earned premiums increased million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of overall growth within our existing programs and the new business we began writing in and  as well as additional selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines 
management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in fees related to our new england based programs  primarily caused by a decrease in premium volume due to reduced rates in the self insured markets on which the fees are based  due to mandatory rate reductions and an increase in competition 
claim fees remained relatively flat for compared to net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was primarily the result of million in net investment income related to procentury 
overall  invested assets increased due to the inclusion of procentury s invested assets  which were million at december   coupled with the investing from positive cash flows from operations 
the positive cash flows from operations were due to favorable underwriting results  increased fee revenue  and the lengthening of the duration of our reserves 
the increase in the duration of our reserves reflected the impact of growth in our excess liability business  which was implemented at the end of this type of business has a longer duration than the average reserves on our other programs and was a larger proportion of reserves 
in addition  the increase in average invested assets reflects cash flows from our equity offering in july the average investment yield for december  was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was 
the current after tax book yield for the year ended december  meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued was  compared to in the duration of the investment portfolio was years at december   compared to years at december  specialty insurance operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the comparable period in this increase in pre tax income primarily demonstrated a continued improvement in underwriting results including favorable reserve development on prior accident years  selective growth in premium  adherence to our strict underwriting guidelines  and our overall leveraging of fixed costs 
in addition  this improvement was attributable to an increase in net investment income 
partially offsetting these improvements were the previously mentioned other than temporary impairments recognized in the investment portfolio in the last half of the year  which primarily related to securities within the investment portfolio acquired with the merger 
in addition  these improvements were also partially offset by the impact of the losses incurred with the two hurricanes  as mentioned above 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in net loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio increased percentage points to in  from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
net loss and lae includes million of net loss and lae expense related to procentury 
in addition  the loss and lae ratio of includes percentage points related to the previously mentioned catastrophe losses 
the loss and lae ratio includes favorable development of million  or percentage points  compared to favorable development of million  or percentage points in the increase in our favorable development in comparison to was primarily the result of an increase in favorable development within our auto liability and general liability lines of business due to lower frequency and severity and better than expected claims results 
this was somewhat offset by an increase in adverse development for an excess program 
our expense ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
the decrease in our expense ratio reflects the anticipated decrease in commission due to the elimination of the fronting fees paid in to an unaffiliated insurance carrier to use their a rated policy forms  which was approximately percentage points incurred in  compared to no costs in despite a higher level of internal fixed costs at procentury  we achieved a percentage point improvement on the expense ratio from leveraging the fixed costs of the combined company 
in addition  lower insurance related assessments and a lower level of other underwriting expenses  such as loss control and commissions relating to mix of business also contributed to this improvement 
agency operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations from our agency operations in thousands for the years ended december  net commission pre tax loss income our agency operations include an allocation of corporate overhead  which includes expenses associated with accounting  information services  legal  and other corporate services 
the corporate overhead allocation excludes those expenses specific to the holding company 
for the years ended december    and  the allocation of corporate overhead to the agency operations segment was million  million  and million  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily reflects regional competition  poor economic conditions  and a softer insurance market within our mid to larger michigan accounts and isolated competitive pricing pressure in the california automobile market 
in addition  this decrease is partially attributable to a  adjustment to reduce an agency commission accrual 
agency operations generated a pre tax loss  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the comparable period in the decrease in the pre tax income is primarily attributable to the decrease in agency commission revenue mentioned above 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily reflected regional competition and a softer insurance market within our mid to larger michigan accounts and isolated competitive pricing pressure in the california automobile market 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in the pre tax income was primarily attributable to the decrease in agency commission revenue mentioned above 
other items reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands minimum reserve maximum reserve line of business range range selected reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves includes residual markets reserves are reviewed by our internal actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves at december  the decrease in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our reserves during and the major components of this change in ultimate loss estimates are as follows in thousands reserves at incurred losses paid losses reserves at december  current prior total current prior total december  line of business year years incurred year years paid workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other net reserves reinsurance recoverable consolidated re estimated development reserves at as a reserves at december  percentage of december  prior year line of business on prior years reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other sub total residual markets total net reserves meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued workers compensation excluding residual markets the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the workers compensation line of business excluding residual markets decreased million  or of net workers compensation reserves 
this net overall decrease reflects decreases of million  million  and million in accident years   and  respectively 
the decreases reflect better than expected experience for many of our workers compensation programs  including a nevada  florida  new england  and countrywide workers compensation association program 
actual losses reported were less than expected given the prior actuarial assumptions 
these decreases were offset by an increase of  in the net ultimate loss estimate for accident year this increase in the net ultimate loss estimate for this accident year was due to greater than expected claim emergence in a florida workers compensation program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial multiple peril and general liability the commercial multiple peril line and general liability line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates of million  or of net commercial multiple peril and general liability reserves 
the net decrease reflects decreases of million  million   and million in the ultimate loss estimates for accident years   and  respectively 
the decreases were due to better than expected claim emergence in general liability business 
these decreases were offset by increases in the net ultimate loss estimates of  million and million for accident years  and  respectively 
these increases were due to greater than expected claim emergence in an excess liability program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial automobile the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the commercial automobile line of business decreased million  or of net commercial automobile reserves 
this net overall decrease reflects decreases of  million and  for accident years  and  respectively 
the decreases for these accident years were due to better than expected claim emergence in two california based programs and an excess liability program 
these decreases were offset by increases of  and  in accident years and  respectively 
these increases were due to greater than expected claim emergence in an excess liability program and a garage program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
other the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the other lines of business decreased million  or of net reserves 
this net decrease reflects decreases of  million and  in the net ultimate loss estimate for accident years  and  respectively 
these decreases were primarily due to better than expected case reserve development during the calendar year in a professional liability program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets from our insurance company subsidiaries  and risk management fees and agency commissions from our non regulated subsidiaries 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  other operating expenses  shareholder dividends  share repurchases  and debt service 
a significant portion of our consolidated assets represents assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that may not be transferable to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to the holding company from our insurance company subsidiaries is limited by regulatory guidelines 
these guidelines generally specify that dividends can be paid only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or of the statutory net income for the prior year  less any dividends paid in the prior twelve months 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend available to be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries during is million without prior regulatory approval 
in addition to ordinary dividends  the insurance company subsidiaries have the capacity to pay million of extraordinary dividends in subject to prior regulatory approval 
the insurance company subsidiaries ability to pay future dividends without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon the insurance company subsidiaries generating net income 
total ordinary dividends paid from our insurance company subsidiaries to our holding company were million and million in and  respectively 
we remain well within our targets as they relate to our premium leverage ratios  even taking into consideration the dividends paid by our insurance company subsidiaries 
our targets for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively

the ordinary dividends paid in and we funded from current financial earnings 
we also generate operating cash flow from non regulated subsidiaries in the form of commission revenue  outside management fees  and intercompany management fees 
these sources of income are used to meet debt service  shareholders dividends  and other operating expenses of the holding company and non regulated subsidiaries 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization from non regulated subsidiaries were approximately million for the year ended december  we have a line of credit totaling million  which there was no outstanding balance at december  the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital and for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to  surplus contributions to our insurance company subsidiaries to support premium growth or strategic acquisitions 
cash flow provided by operations was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from operations reflects growth in underwriting profits and growth in net investment income  primarily as a result of the merger 
our strong operating cash flows are also the result of our ability to match the duration of our invested assets and reserve duration as it relates to our meadowbrook insurance group  inc

excluding the junior subordinated debentures acquired in conjunction with the merger  we received a total of million in net proceeds from the issuances of the above long term debt  of which million was contributed to the surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries and the remaining balance was used for general corporate purposes 
associated with the issuance of the above long term debt we incurred approximately million in issuance costs for commissions paid to the placement agents in the transactions 
the issuance costs associated with these debentures have been capitalized and are included in other assets on the balance sheet 
as of june   these issuance costs were being amortized over a seven year period as a component of interest expense 
the seven year amortization period represented management s best estimate of the estimated useful life of the bonds related to both the senior debentures and junior subordinated debentures 
beginning july   we reevaluated our best estimate and determined a five year amortization period to be a more accurate representation of the estimated useful life 
therefore  this change in amortization period from seven years to five years has been applied prospectively beginning july  the junior subordinated debentures issued in and  were issued in conjunction with the issuance of million and million in mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities to a trust formed by an institutional investor from our unconsolidated subsidiary trusts  respectively

management s discussion and analysis continued interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on our existing debt obligations 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges 
these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income

the dividend is payable on april   to shareholders of record as of march  when evaluating the declaration of a dividend  our board of directors considers a variety of factors  including but not limited to  cash flow  liquidity needs  results of operations  industry conditions  and our overall financial condition

procentury merger following the close of business on july   our merger with procentury was completed 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the stock price used in determining the final cash and share consideration portion of the purchase price was based on the volume weighted average sales price of a share of meadowbrook common stock for the day trading period ending on the sixth trading day before the completion of the merger  or

management s discussion and analysis continued regulatory a significant portion of our consolidated assets represents assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that may not be transferable to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to the holding company from our insurance company subsidiaries is limited by regulatory guidelines 
these guidelines generally specify that dividends can be paid only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or of the statutory net income for the prior year  less any dividends paid in the prior twelve months 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend available to be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries during is million without prior regulatory approval 
in addition to ordinary dividends  the insurance company subsidiaries have the capacity to pay million of extraordinary dividends in subject to prior regulatory approval 
the insurance company subsidiaries ability to pay future dividends without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon the insurance company subsidiaries generating net income 
total ordinary dividends paid from our insurance company subsidiaries to our holding company were million and million in and  respectively

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively 
we maintain an investment portfolio with varying maturities that we believe will provide adequate cash for the payment of claims 
variable compensation we have established two variable compensation plans as an incentive for performance of our management team 
they consist of an annual bonus plan bonus plan and a long term incentive plan ltip 
the bonus plan is a discretionary cash bonus plan premised upon a targeted growth in net after tax earnings on a year over year basis 
each year  the compensation committee and our board of directors establish a new target based upon prior year performance and the forecasted performance levels anticipated for the following year 
the amount of the bonus pool is established by aggregating the individual targets for each participant  which is a percentage of salary 
at the end of the year  the compensation committee and the board of directors review our performance in relation to performance targets and then establish the total bonus pool to be utilized to pay cash bonuses to the management team based upon overall corporate and individual participant goals 
the ltip is intended to provide an incentive to management to improve our performance over a three year period  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the ltip is not discretionary and is based upon a target for an average three year return on beginning equity 
if the targets are met and all other terms and conditions are satisfied  the ltip awards are paid 
the ltip is paid in cash and in stock 
a participant s percentage is established by the compensation committee and the board of directors in advance of any new three year ltip award 
the stock component of the ltip is paid based upon the closing stock price at the beginning of the three year ltip performance period  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ltip 
with the procentury merger our compensation committee and board of directors determined that our opportunity for successfully integrating the procentury merger would be heightened and shareholder value increased  if all participants were in the same equity based plan beginning in as a result  our compensation committee approved the termination of our current ltip effective december  and established a new plan for based on new performance targets 
based on this amendment  the current ltip participants would receive their award based on a two year performance period  rather than a three year period 
therefore  the total award would be approximately two thirds of the original three year award 
there were no accounting adjustments as a result of the amendment as there were no changes to the underlying plan  only an adjustment to the performance period 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued both the bonus plan and the ltip are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors and all awards are reviewed and approved by the board of directors at both inception and at distribution 
regulatory and rating issues the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
at december   each of our insurance company subsidiaries was in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required 
insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg  premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
our targets for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated three ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons are set forth below ratio usual range value company star adjusted liabilities to liquid assets under company williamsburg gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under company procentury insurance company change in net premiums written over or under adjusted liabilities to liquid assets on star is outside the usual range primarily as a result of our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
the adjusted liabilities includes the gross amount of reinsurance payables related to the pool and does not allow an offset to those payables for any reinsurance recoverables related to the pool 
in addition  the reinsurance recoverables are not included in the liquid assets portion of the formula 
this causes the ratio results to appear much higher due to the timing of the settlement of the pool balances 
pool balances between the entities are settled in the month following the completion of the pooling 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the gross agents balances to policyholders surplus on williamsburg was impacted by our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
williamsburg s assumed premium receivable increased as a result of the pooling agreement 
excluding the intercompany pooling  this ratio would have been within the usual range for these balances settled on january   resulting in an updated ratio of the change in net premiums written outside the usual range resulted primarily from the intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement whereby procentury insurance company is assuming its share of a much larger pool base in procentury insurance company also wrote additional direct business in the ocean marine  inland marine and commercial auto liability lines of business in  compared with reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries  including those insurance company subsidiaries we acquired in the procentury merger  and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in regard to our excess of loss reinsurance  we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective or existing reinsurers 
we generally do not seek collateral where the reinsurer is rated a or better by a

fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
asc requires entities to separate an other than temporary impairment of a debt security into two components when there are credit related losses associated with the impaired debt security for which management believes the company does not have the intent to sell the security  and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if management concludes a security is other than temporarily impaired  asc requires that the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the security be presented as an other than temporary impairment charge within earnings  with an offset for any noncredit related loss component of the other than temporary impairment charge to be recognized in other comprehensive income 
in addition  asc requires that companies record  as of the beginning of the interim period of adoption  a cumulative effect adjustment to reclassify the noncredit component of a previously recognized otti loss from retained earnings to other comprehensive income if the company does not intend to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of an asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and a half and five and a half years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of years  compared to years at december  at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was billion 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is primarily interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is related to our investments in relatively small positions of preferred stocks and mutual funds with an emphasis on dividend income 
these investments comprise of our investment portfolio 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
we continue to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
the table below presents our model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps fair value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material change in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  our term loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on our term loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had an outstanding balance on our term loan of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
expense by  at december   we had an outstanding balance on our term loan of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on our existing debt obligations 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges 
these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
refer to note derivative instruments for further detail relating to our interest rate swap transactions 
in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we did not have an outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit
