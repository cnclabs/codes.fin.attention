we are a medical technology company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics and medical devices for cardiovascular and ischemic disease  wound healing and tissue repair 
since we were initially funded in october  we have made three strategic acquisitions and assembled a portfolio of innovative late stage cardiovascular and regenerative medicine product candidates 
we have established a pipeline of innovative products that are divided into two operating units  cardium biologics and the tissue repair company 
we report our operations in a single operating segment 
our business is focused on the acquisition and strategic development of product opportunities or businesses having the potential to address significant unmet medical needs  and definable pathways to commercialization  partnering or other monetization following the achievement of corresponding development objectives 
consistent with our overall business strategy  as our product opportunities and businesses are advanced and corresponding valuations established  we intend to consider various corporate development transactions designed to place our product candidates into larger organizations or with partners having existing commercialization  sales and marketing resources  and a need for innovative products 
such transactions could involve the sale  partnering or other monetization of particular product opportunities or businesses 
since december   we i completed the sale of innercool therapies to royal philips electronics  ii completed tissue repair company s matrix b clinical trial  iii submitted an fda k application for the use of excellagen tm in the potential treatment of diabetic and other chronic wounds  and iv announced the company s new orthobiologics initiative  designed to build on and extend the underlying technology developed by the tissue repair company to hard tissue application such as bone 

table of contents following the sale of our innercool therapies business  we do not currently have any products available for sale or use 
because of the limited nature of our revenues and the high costs we must incur to develop our product candidates  we have yet to generate positive cash flows or income from operations and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are currently dependent on debt and equity funding to finance our operations 
during the second half of we raised net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and warrants in two registered direct offerings

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies such as derivative liabilities and stock option compensation expense that are calculated using the black scholes option model that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december  expenses related to derivative liabilities were calculated at  and expenses for stock based compensation was  these policies require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
if we were to undervalue of derivative liabilities or stock option compensation expense we would understate the expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operation 
conversely if we were to overvalue or derivative liabilities and stock option compensation expenses we would overstate the expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements

as of december   the company recorded a liability for discretionary employee and officer bonuses for past performance 
the payment of such bonuses was expected to take place sometime in given the ongoing difficulties in the financial markets  which made it more challenging and expensive for companies to raise funds  the compensation committee of our board of directors felt it appropriate to forego the planned payment of these bonuses

we did not have any accounts receivable  inventory or other assets on our balance sheet at december  that provided us with liquidity 
our working capital was a deficit of  at december   compared to a deficit of  at

excluding the effect of the derivative liabilities our working capital at december  would have been net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period last year 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was a result of the decrease in company wide spending as we focused on resources on the completion of near term milestones including the matrix clinical study and advancement of innercool s portfolio of products  each of which provides partnering opportunities 
our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from financing activities and in particular proceeds from the sale of our common stock and our debt financing 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   and was primarily derived from proceeds we received from the sale of our common stock and debt financing  net of issuance costs and the sales of our innercool business unit  offset by principal debt repayments in the amount of  during the year 
on march  we completed a subordinated secured debt financing for which we received gross proceeds of approximately million before placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately  in june we completed an unsecured debt financing for which we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately  before placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately  during the third quarter of we closed the philips transaction and received net proceeds of approximately million excluding  being held in an escrow account

on march   we completed a registered direct offering of  units  which were sold to institutional and retail investors  at a price of per unit 
each unit consisted of shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock 
the common stock purchase warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of per share  at any time after six months from the date of closing and have a term of exercise equal to five years from the initial exercise date 
in the aggregate  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares were issued in the offering 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of approximately million after deduction of offering fees and expenses 
capital resources our primary source of capital is the cash that we generate from the sale of debt or equity securities 
we do not currently have any line of credit or other source of capital available to us 
we have generated significant losses from operation to date and anticipate that the negative cash flow from operations will continue for we raised in excess of million in capital following the year ended december  we expect that capital will support our operations for at least the next twelve months  during 
table of contents which time we hope to complete a strategic licensing agreement or secure the approval and future sales of the excellagen product family and or other corporate transaction 
however  if we fail to enter into a significant licensing arrangement or generate sufficient product sales  we will not generate sufficient cash flows to cover our operating expenses 
if needed  we intend to secure additional working capital through the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
no arrangements or commitments for any such financing are in place at this time  and we cannot give any assurances about the availability or terms of any future financing 
because of our historic net losses  and our working capital deficit  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a limited level of market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  due to the investment of our available cash in various instruments 
the goal of our investment activities is to preserve principal while seeking to increase income received on our investments without significantly increasing risk 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
we generally do not  however  enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or to otherwise manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
generally  we seek to limit our exposure to risk by investing substantially in short term  investment grade securities  such as commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
the amount of interest income we receive on our investments will vary with changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  generally decreasing as interest rates decrease and increasing as interest rates increase 
while we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or other market risks or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  due to the short term  investment grade nature of our investments  we do not believe our exposure to market risk from our investments is material
