during the quarter ended september   the company identified an adjustment to the income tax provision that should have been included in its previously filed financial statements on form k for the year ended december  the issue was discovered during the process of reconciling the income tax provision in the financial statements to the income tax return and the required adjustment resulted in a decrease in income tax expense  an increase in refundable income taxes and an increase in retained earnings of million  which has been reflected in the accompanying financial statements  for the year ended december  the adjustment also resulted in an increase to the company s previously reported earnings per diluted share of 
there was no impact to the cash flows from operating activities as the increase in net earnings was offset by the increase in refundable income taxes 
we do not believe that the adjustments to the provision for income taxes  refundable income taxes  and retained earnings described above are material to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows for any of the company s previously filed annual or quarterly financial statements 
accordingly  the december  financial statements included herein have been revised to reflect the adjustment to income tax expense  refundable income taxes and retained earnings discussed above

the net of tax effect of these adjustments increases the company s previously reported earnings per share by   and for the quarters ended march  june and september  respectively 
these adjustments increased the unamortized portion of deferred financing fees included in long term assets by million  increased income taxes payable and deferred tax liabilities by million  and increased retained earnings by million as of september  there was no impact to quarterly cash flows in as the increase in net earnings was offset by the decrease in the non cash reconciling items for deferred financing fee amortization and deferred taxes 
the company does not believe that these adjustments are material to the results of operations  financial position or cash flows for any of its previously filed quarterly financial statements 
accordingly  the company will revise its quarterly financial statements prospectively within its quarterly reports on form q

table of contents year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales decreased in to billion from billion in this decrease was the result of lower year over year sales in the crane segment primarily due to the global macro economic downturn as well as a broad global credit crisis in the banking industry 
partially offsetting the lower consolidated net sales was higher sales in the foodservice segment as a result of additional revenue related to businesses acquired in the enodis acquisition during the fourth quarter of sales in our crane segment decreased for the year ended december  compared to the weaker foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar had an unfavorable impact on consolidated net sales of approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  further analysis of the changes in sales by segment is presented in the sales and operating earnings by segment section below 
gross profit decreased for the year ended december  to million compared to billion for the year ended december   a decrease of 
gross margin decreased in to from in the decrease in consolidated gross profit was driven by the crane segment as a result of decreased sales volumes across all regions  increased manufacturing unabsorbed overhead costs and an unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
this decrease was partially offset by higher foodservice gross profit due to the inclusion of enodis and various cost reduction initiatives in both segments during the decrease in gross margin occurred primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in the crane segment partially offset by higher gross margin in the foodservice segment due to cost reductions and pricing actions 
in addition  the strength in the us dollar resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately million or for the year ended december  engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by higher expenses in the foodservice segment as a result of including the enodis es a expenses but was partially offset by lower crane segment and foodservice segment es a expenses due to lower employee related costs and other discretionary spending reductions and realization of synergies associated with the enodis integration 
the strength of the us dollar resulted in a decrease in es a expenses of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  amortization expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for primarily as a result of the additional intangible assets acquired from enodis see further detail related to the intangible assets at note  acquisitions 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
under asc topic  goodwill is no longer amortized  however  the company performs an annual impairment at june of every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units  which are cranes americas  cranes europe  middle east  and africa  cranes asia  crane care  foodservice americas  foodservice europe  middle east  and africa  foodservice asia  and foodservice retail 
in its impairment reviews  the company uses a fair value method based on the present value of future cash flows  which involves management s judgments and assumptions about the amounts of those cash flows and the discount rates used 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets are then subject to risk of write down to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
during the first quarter of  the company s stock price continued to decline as global market conditions remained depressed  the credit markets did not improve and the performance of the company s crane and foodservice segments was below the company s expectations 
in connection with a reforecast of expected financial results completed in early april  the company determined the foregoing circumstances to be indicators of potential impairment under the guidance of asc topic therefore  the company performed the required initial impairment test for each of the company s reporting units as of march  the company re performed its established method of present valuing future cash flows  taking into account its updated projections  to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
the determination of fair value of the reporting units requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  projections of revenue growth  operating earnings  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and required capital for each reporting unit 
due to the 
table of contents inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ materially from the estimates 
the company evaluated the significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  both individually and in the aggregate  and concluded they were reasonable 
the results of the analysis indicated that the fair values of three of the company s eight reporting units foodservice americas  foodservice europe  middle east  and africa  and foodservice retail were potentially impaired  and therefore  the company proceeded to measure the amount of the potential impairment with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
upon completion of that assessment  the company recognized impairment charges as of march  of million related to goodwill 
the company also recognized impairment charges of million related to other indefinite lived intangible assets as of march  both charges were within the foodservice segment 
these non cash impairment charges have no direct impact on the company s cash flows  liquidity  debt covenants  debt position or tangible asset values 
there is no tax benefit in relation to the goodwill impairment  however  the company did recognize a million benefit associated with the other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment 
in june  the company performed its annual impairment analysis relative to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at june  and based on those results the company determined no additional impairment had occurred subsequent to the impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of the company will continue to monitor market conditions and determine if any additional interim reviews of goodwill  other intangibles or long lived assets are warranted 
further deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with the company s projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event the company determines that assets are impaired in the future  the company would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated balance sheet and results of operations 
the company is engaged in a number of integration activities associated with the enodis acquisition 
for the years ended december  and december  integration expenses were million and million  respectively 
integration expenses include only costs directly associated with the integration  such as costs related to outside vendors or services  costs of employees who have been assigned full time to integration activities  and travel related expenses 
during december  the company sold two product lines within its foodservice segment for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million and recognized an aggregate loss on the sale of million 
the two product lines that were divested were the company s lincoln smallwares products and most of its merco product category 
the smallwares products were sold to the vollrath company  llc and included products such as pots  pans  baking sheets and other cooking implements as well as manual food preparation equipment eg  slicers  peelers 
the merco product category was sold to hatco corporation and included food warming equipment  merchandisers  toasters  and racking dispensing systems 
the company recorded a loss of million for the sale of its smallwares products and a loss of million for the sale of its merco products 
restructuring expenses for the year ended december  totaled million which compares to million in as a result of the continued worldwide decline in crane segment sales in  the company recorded million in restructuring charges as it further reduced the crane segment cost structure in all regions 
in addition  the foodservice segment recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december  in connection with closing of its harford duracool facility in aberdeen  maryland in the second quarter and its mccall facility in parsons  tennessee in the third quarter 
see further detail related to the restructuring expenses at note  restructuring 
interest expenses for the year ended december  totaled million versus million for the year ended december  the increase is the result of an additional interest expense related to the billion credit agreement which was entered into in order to fund the enodis acquisition and which was amended and restated as of august  to ultimately increase the size to billion new credit agreement and was drawn upon on november  see further detail on the new credit agreement at note  debt 
amortization expenses for deferred financing fees was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the higher expense in is related to the amortization of the fees associated with entering into the new credit agreement 
the loss on debt extinguishment of million for the year ended december  is a result of the accelerated paydown of term loan x of million by using the proceeds from the sale of the enodis ice businesses in the second quarter and the accelerated paydown of term loan b of million and term loan x of million using cash from operations in the fourth quarter 
for the year ended december   the company made a cash payment of million to partially pay down the balance of the term loan x from the proceeds of the marine divestiture and as a result of this payment  the company incurred a charge of million 
both charges were recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations 
during july  the company entered into various hedging transactions the hedges to comply with the terms of its new credit agreement see further detail related to the new credit agreement at note  debt issued to fund the purchase of enodis 
the hedges were required to limit the company s exposure to fluctuations in the underlying purchase great british pound gbp price of the enodis shares which could have ultimately required additional funding capacity under the new credit agreement 
subsequent to entering into the hedging transactions  the us dollar strengthened against the gbp which resulted in a significant change to the fair 
table of contents value of the underlying hedges 
under the guidance of asc topic  derivatives and hedging  hedges of a firm commitment to acquire a business do not qualify for hedge accounting or balance sheet treatment 
therefore  the periodic market value changes in these hedges were required to be recognized in the income statement 
for the year ended december   the loss on currency hedges related to the purchase of enodis was million 
other income  net for the year ended december  was million versus a loss of million for the prior year 
the income in was primarily the result of foreign currency gains related to transactions between our us and foreign crane facilities during the year whereby we benefitted from the us dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies and is also partially due to higher interest income 
the loss in was the result of other foreign currency losses partially offset by interest income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to negative for the year ended december  as the company posted a pre tax loss in  a positive effective tax rate represents a benefit to the consolidated statement of operations 
in the company posted pre tax income  for which a negative effective tax rate represents a benefit to the consolidated statement of operations 
the goodwill impairment of million in is not tax deductible and thus had an unfavorable impact to the effective tax rate 
the write down of the trademarks of million had an associated deferred tax liability of million which resulted in no impact to the effective tax rate for the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was favorably impacted by the reversal of various reserves for uncertain tax positions as discussed in note  income taxes 
during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be utilized in several jurisdictions including china  slovakia  spain  and the united kingdom 
therefore  the company recognized million of valuation allowances as income tax expense 
the company generated million of net operating loss carryforwards in france during  creating a deferred tax asset of million 
based upon the cyclicality of the company s crane business  management analyzes the ability to utilize these deferred tax assets on a seven year cycle  consistent with the crane business cycles  as this provides the best information to evaluate the future profitability of the business unit 
at december   the company has concluded that a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset for the carryforward is not required to be recognized 
however  prior to the complete utilization of these carryforwards  particularly if the current economic downturn continues and the company generates operating losses in its operations in these jurisdictions for an extended period of time  it is possible the company might conclude that the benefit of these carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
the company updates its financial forecast of these operations quarterly and continues to closely monitor the utilization of these losses 
the recognition of these valuation allowances  if necessary  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations 
both the and effective tax rates were also favorably affected  as compared to the statutory rate  to varying degrees by certain global tax planning initiatives 
the effective tax rate in was favorably affected by the significant decrease in us pre tax income resulting from the loss on currency hedges related to the enodis acquisition  and certain global tax planning initiatives that are not impacted by pre tax income volatility 
the results from discontinued operations were a loss of million and a loss of million  net of income taxes  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss relates to the enodis ice businesses sold on may  and the final completion of closing and tax adjustments on the results of the discontinued operations associated with the disposition of the marine segment sold on december  the loss relates to the results of operations of the former marine segment sold on december  and the enodis ice businesses classified as held for sale at the end of  which included a non cash impairment charge of million 
we also realized an after tax loss of million on the sale of the enodis ice businesses and the marine segment as a result of final settlement of working capital and tax adjustments in the gain on the sale of discontinued operations of million in relates to the sale of our former marine segment

tai an dongyue 
there was a net loss of million in connection with the joint venture for the same period of see further detail related to the joint venture at note  acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to consolidated net sales increased in to billion from billion in this increase was the result of higher year over year sales in the crane segment and higher sales in the foodservice segment as a result of sales from our newly acquired enodis business 
this business generated net sales of approximately million since its acquisition on october  sales in our crane segment increased for the year ended december  compared to the stronger euro currency compared to the us dollar had a favorable impact on sales of approximately million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gross profit increased for the year ended december  to billion compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
gross margin decreased in to from in the increase in consolidated gross profit was driven by both segments as a result of higher sales volumes in the crane segment and the inclusion of gross profit results of the enodis business for two months 
the decrease in gross margin occurred as a result of higher material costs for both segments 
crane segment gross profit increased in to million from million in  while gross margin decreased to from over the same period 
the foodservice segment s gross profit increased in to million from million  while gross margin decreased from in to in the strength in the euro currency resulted in an increase on gross profit of approximately million or for the year ended december  engineering  selling and administrative es a expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by higher expenses in the crane and foodservice segments and for general corporate expenses 
crane segment es a expense increased due to higher selling expenses  increased costs related to the and acquisitions  expenses related to the erp implementation project and the negative impact of the stronger euro resulting in an additional million in expenses 
the increase in foodservice segment es a expenses were due to approximately two months of additional expenses incurred within the enodis business

the crane segment benefited from a strong crane end market demand during the first nine months of compared to the same period of due to the slowing world economy  the lower demand for cranes  especially for tower cranes  during the last months of was lower than the same period in from a product line standpoint  the sales increase was driven by increased volumes of crawler  tower and mobile hydraulic cranes worldwide  and increases in our aftermarket sales and service business  slightly offset by decreased sales of our boom truck cranes in north america due to the continued soft residential housing construction market

market conditions and outlook in  we plan to continue to strengthen our two business segments cranes and related products and foodservice equipment 
we move into with a highly skilled and talented workforce  complemented by formidable competitive positions in our industries 
we will also continue to optimize our diverse global manufacturing base and invest in rapidly growing emerging markets 
although the early signs of improving global economies are bolstering our outlook  we remain cautious in our outlook for and we believe we are prepared to adjust to the trends in our end markets 
we believe that we have demonstrated that we can quickly adapt to a changing economy  and have shown flexibility as well as iniative in managing through the cyclicality of our crane markets  which should position our company for future growth opportunities when our end markets recover 
looking ahead to  we expect foodservice segment revenues to improve modestly and operating margins to continue their solid improvement 
we believe that a year over year percentage decline in crane segment revenues will be significantly lower than the decline in we also expect crane segment revenues in the first half of will be significantly lower than those in the first half of  however  we expect crane segment revenue gains in the second half of versus the second half of additionally  we anticipate that operating margins in our crane segment will track above the trough margin that we experienced in other financial expectations include capital expenditures of approximately million  depreciation and amortization of approximately million and debt reduction of at least million 
cranes and related products our crane segment is beginning to see signs of recovery in crane demand especially in emerging markets in asia  latin america  africa and the middle east 
in addition  in december  we saw signs of demand improvement in some mature markets such as germany and australia 
as a result  for the first time in more than a year  we had a month to month increase in our backlog from million in november to million in december 
we have taken advantage of the recession to increase our efforts in innovation and to implement our product and manufacturing innovations globally 
we are expanding lean six sigma concepts in all manufacturing locations worldwide  and have implemented several initiatives to further improve our efforts in product reliability and customer satisfaction 
we have also initiated a worldwide supplier development program to help reduce costs and improve quality 
our partnership efforts with a variety of suppliers to produce and source operator cabs and boom channel fabrications are good examples of this collaboration 
looking ahead  we see opportunities driven by major global trends  such as the need for improving infrastructure as well as energy and power generation 
this includes significant growth in wind energy projects in many parts of the world 
we enjoy a strong position in these industries in both the mature and emerging markets 
we also continue to see demand for our industry leading product support services 
our crane care business is not only a key differentiator for manitowoc  but it is also especially important to our customers during an economic downturn when there is an intensified focus on minimizing total cost of ownership 
our backlog as of december  is much lower than it was at the beginning of therefore  we expect additional revenue decline in  but it is expected to be at a significantly lower percentage decline than experienced in if present trends continue  we believe we will begin to realize sequential quarterly revenue growth as we proceed through the year 
making these forecasts is extremely challenging due to mixed views from nearly every trade association and industry economist that we follow 
for example  the association of equipment manufacturers believes that the us construction machinery business will increase in conversely  the us department of commerce is forecasting that construction put in place for will decline by 
from an international perspective  global insight  a provider of global economic and financial analysis  forecasting and market intelligence  believes the world s total construction will grow by less than in in light of these differing forecasts  we are maintaining as much operational flexibility as possible 
this includes tight controls on inventory  es a expenses and manufacturing costs  and a clear focus on the bottom line and cash 
we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from working capital in for  our top five priorities in our crane segment are the following 
table of contents continuing to build on our strong market share position in emerging markets across most product lines  developing our distribution network in india and china  maintaining our global efforts on innovation and product development  maintaining a balance between lean inventory and being able to respond to the short lead time expectations of our customers  and finally  leveraging our large installed base to maximize aftermarket revenue opportunities
