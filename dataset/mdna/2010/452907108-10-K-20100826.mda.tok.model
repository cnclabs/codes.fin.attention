overview we are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics  cytokines or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes approximately issued patents in the us and more than other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
we have continued to transition our focus away from the development and commercialization of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates  although we manufacture and commercialize our leukoscan product in territories where regulatory approvals have previously been granted 
leukoscan is indicated for diagnostic imaging for determining the location and extent of infection inflammation in bone in patients with suspected osteomyelitis  including patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
from inception in through june  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  or fda  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables as a separate unit of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we have concluded that the license and collaboration agreement dated july   or the nycomed agreement  with nycomed gmbh  and the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa  or the ucb agreement  should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we amortized the million payment received as part of the nycomed agreement over the expected obligation period  which was originally estimated to be december during the fiscal year this amortization period was changed to march  when all obligations under this agreement were completed 
we also concluded that the million payment received from ucb should be amortized over the expected obligation period of the ucb agreement  which was initially estimated to end in november however  as previously disclosed  during the fiscal year  ucb decided to stop further new patient enrollment into the systemic lupus erythematosus  or sle  clinical trials designed and initiated by us 
ucb ultimately decided to establish new protocols under which new clinical trials for the treatment of sle would be conducted and subsequently terminated the then existing sle clinical trials that had been designed and initiated by immunomedics 
as a result of the ucb decision to terminate the two phase iii sle trials  initiated by immunomedics  we were no longer able to determine how these decisions would impact the obligation period for our remaining potential manufacturing responsibilities under the terms of the agreement with ucb 
accordingly  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing to revenue the deferred revenue recorded with the receipt of the up front payments from ucb at the inception of the license agreement 
in august  we were relieved by ucb of our remaining obligation to supply ucb with any further supplies 
therefore  as our last obligation under the agreement was legally terminated  we amortized the remainder of the upfront payment million received from ucb as revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there is no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
during the fiscal year  we recorded revenue of million for milestone payments under the terms of the nycomed agreement 
contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
research and development costs that are reimbursable under collaboration agreements are recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we record these reimbursements as a reduction of research and development expenses as our partner in the collaboration agreement has the financial risks and responsibility for conducting these research and development activities 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts based on historical trends  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
auction rate securities we hold a number of interest bearing auction rate securities  or ars  that represent investments in pools of assets 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
ars have long term scheduled maturities  but have interest rates that are typically reset at pre determined intervals every days for the securities purchased by us  at which time the securities can typically be purchased or sold  creating a liquid market 
in an active market for such investments  the rate reset for each instrument is an opportunity to accept the reset rate or sell the instrument at its face value in order to seek an alternative investment 
in the past  the auction process has allowed investors to roll over their holdings or obtain immediate liquidity by selling the securities at par 
the auctions failed during fiscal and have not settled in an active market since that time 
the uncertainties in the credit markets have affected our holdings in ars investments as the auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
the ars held are primarily aaa rated collateralized by student loans  guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and backed by insurance companies 
to date we have collected all interest payable on all ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
as of june   we held three auction rate securities with a par value of million 
these securities are classified as either current or long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet  based on their anticipated liquidity 
until february  the auction rate securities market was highly liquid 
during the year ended june   we sold three ars for million par value of million to brokers in a secondary market 
in addition  million of ars were redeemed at par value during the year ended june  the carrying value of the ars sold and redeemed was million  resulting in a gain of million realized in fiscal year ended june  in july  we sold one ars for million par value of million to a broker in a secondary market 
the remaining two ars are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process  of which there is no assurance 
we reviewed our ars to determine whether the classification of the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
this treatment is appropriate when a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and a company has the ability to hold the investment until a recovery in market value takes place 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the intent and our ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
as a result of our assessment of a number of factors  including without limitation  market conditions and the credit quality of these securities  we determined that the estimated fair value does not approximate par value  although we continue to earn interest on our ars at the maximum contractual rate 
accordingly  beginning with the three month period ended march   we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge to reduce the value of the ars to their estimated fair value 
utilizing a discounted cash flow model we determined that the change in the estimated fair value of our remaining investments in ars for the year ended june resulted in other than temporary impairment charge of million which was recorded as other expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recorded an unrealized gain on ars of million for the year ended june  which was recorded as part of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars 
as of june   we estimated the fair value of these marketable securities to be million 
the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model as of june  include i estimates for the investment s contractual bond coupon rates ranging from  ii the market yield interest rates estimated at the us treasury seven year bond rate of plus a premium factor of and iii the effective maturity period of approximately seven years which is the period the auctions are expected to resume its normal function 
if our estimates regarding the fair value of these securities are inaccurate  a future other than temporary impairment charge may be required 
additionally  these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions and  as such  we may be required to record additional losses for impairment if we determine there are further declines in fair value 
during the years ended june  and  we reported million and million  respectively  of amortization of the market value discount of the ars 
foreign currency risks for subsidiaries outside of the united states that operate in a local currency environment  income and expense items are translated to united states dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year  assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in the determination of comprehensive loss 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income loss 
stock based compensation we currently have an employee share option plan  or the plan  which permits the grant of share options and shares to our employees for up to million shares of common stock 
a summary of this plan is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant  those option awards generally vest based on four years of continuous service and have seven year contractual terms 
certain options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the plan 
the fair value of each option granted during the years ended june   and is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in the following table years ended june  expected dividend yield expected option term years expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate the weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during the years ended june   and were  and per share  respectively 
we used historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected stock price volatility was calculated on ten year daily stock trading history 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have a total of  shares underlying non vested options and restricted stock grants outstanding as of june  as of june  and there was million and million  respectively  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is being recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the weighted average remaining contractual terms of the exercisable shares is years and years as of june  and  respectively 
impairment of assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of our ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
life insurance policies the company has various life insurance policies on dr 
goldenberg  which are for the benefit of the company 
when the company is the beneficiary of the policy  and there are no other contractual arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg  the company recognizes the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement as an asset in the balance sheet 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million or 
the increase for the year ended june  is primarily the result of recording license fee revenue of million for the ucb agreement 
there was no corresponding revenue for ucb in in august  we received notice from ucb relieving us of our responsibilities for the manufacturing of epratuzumab  the only remaining obligation under the ucb agreement  thus allowing us to record the full amount of the remaining deferred license fee revenue 
product sales for the year ended june  were million  as compared to million for the same period in  representing a decrease of million or due to lower sales volume of leukoscan in europe over the previous year 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or due to the timing and size of the grant programs in the current year 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of million or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june  due primarily to million of increased expense reimbursement from nycomed which we do not expect to continue at the same level in fiscal and million of lower patent related expenses  partially offset by million of higher levels of materials  supplies and testing for nycomed related production  million of higher spending for clinical trials as well as million from higher headcount and related salaries and employee benefits 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended june  increased by million or to million from million in fiscal year ended june  during the year ended june   cost of goods sold increased million as a result of the inventory reserve on certain of our leukoscan work in process inventories which were deemed to be unsaleable due to a third party manufacturer s process deviation that resulted in product that did not meet our quality control standards 
excluding the impact of the inventory reserve adjustment for work in process  the gross profit margins were for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the decline in the gross profit percentage in fiscal year was primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impact 
sales and marketing expenses for the and fiscal years were million 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in additional incentive compensation due to dr 
david m 
goldenberg in accordance with his employment agreement 
a gain of million was reported for the year ended june  on the sales and redemptions of auction rate securities with a carrying value of million par value of million  as compared to a million temporary impairment charge on marketable securities associated with our investments in auction rate securities for the year ended june   partially offset by a  gain on the settlement of auction rate securities 
see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities 
interest and other income decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decline was primarily the result of lower rates of return on investments and lower cash balances during the year 
this decline in fiscal year was partially offset by an increase of  for the amortization of the discount for the auction rate securities over the previous year 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of million and million  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately million and million of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of million  which was offset by a similar federal tax refund received for the fiscal year alternative minimum tax paid  as provided by the federal troubled asset relief program 
in addition  for the fiscal year we recorded a million reduction of tax obligations of our foreign subsidiaries 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of million and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of million 
the tax benefits for fiscal years and were also partially offset by new jersey state income tax provisions of  and  respectively 
net income allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is million  or per share as compared to million  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million  or 
license fee and other revenue for the fiscal year was million compared to no license fee and other revenue in the fiscal year 
the fiscal year included million of amortization of deferred revenue as a result of the nycomed agreement executed in august the fiscal year did not include any amortization of deferred revenues from the ucb agreement due to the decision by ucb in february to stop patient enrollment into the sle clinical trials  as discussed in our critical accounting policy 
product sales for the year ended june  were million  as compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of million or due to increased sales of leukoscan in europe over the previous year  partially offset by the unfavorable currency impact of the euro 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this increase was the result of there being three phase ii grant programs in effect for most of fiscal year as compared to two smaller phase i grant programs in effect available in the previous year 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june  due primarily to expense reimbursements of million received from nycomed  partially offset by additional employees and related salaries and employee benefits 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended june  decreased by million or to million from million in fiscal year ended june  gross profit margins were for the fiscal year compared to for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit percentage in fiscal year was primarily due to our expensing of work in process inventory that failed our quality assurance testing in fiscal sales and marketing expenses for fiscal years and were million 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million or from million in fiscal year to million 
this increase is primarily attributed to the termination of certain severance payments and insurance benefits as part of our previous employment agreement with dr 
david m 
goldenberg million and the termination of the split dollar insurance life insurance agreement and related liabilities million which occurred in the previous year  not recurring in the current year 
exclusive of the insurance related items  general and administrative expenses decreased million or as compared to the prior year 
a charge of million was reported for the year ended june  for an other than temporary impairment charge on marketable securities associated with our investments in auction rate securities as compared to a charge of million reported for the year ended june  see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other than temporary impairment charge 
interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to the sale in the prior year of four executive life insurance contracts which were no longer deemed to be necessary resulting in million of other income and lower levels of investments as well as lower rates of return on investments 
this decrease was partially offset by million for the amortization of the discount for the auction rate securities 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of million and million  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately million and million of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of million and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of million 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of  and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of million 
the tax benefits for and fiscal years were also partially offset by new jersey state income tax provisions of  and  respectively 
net income allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is million  or per share as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our product candidates in development were million for the fiscal year ended june   million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses decreased by million in fiscal year  or  as compared to research and development expenses decreased by million in  or  as compared to we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple product candidates at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consists of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  in thousands research costs product development costs total research costs research costs in total increased by million or for the year ended june  research costs in total increased by million or for the year ended june  the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to due primarily to salary increases 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to  a result of increased employee staffing levels 
this increase was a result of an increase to the employee headcount to offset the previous years attrition 
the use of outside research and testing services in were million  a decrease of million or compared to this decrease resulted from the level of spending for outside services that was not required from federal grant program activities that were necessary in the previous year 
outside research and testing services in were million  an increase of million or compared to this increase resulted from research activities performed for the company for increased federal grant program activities and other necessary commercial research support which was not available in our existing facility 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in  an increase of million or from this increase was a result of the increased level of activities from the previous year 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in  an increase of million or from this increase was a result of the replenishment of supplies from the previous year arising from the company s cost savings efforts during the fiscal year 
indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to research based on research spending levels increased by million or to million in fiscal year  primarily resulting from employee related costs 
indirect administrative and support services for fiscal year were million as compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or  primarily as a result of the increase to employee related costs 
product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by million or as compared to product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by million or as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following in  the company benefited from cost efficiencies realized on labor and overhead as a result of continued efforts on the development of veltuzumab for nycomed 
the company received million in reimbursed product manufacturing expenses in the fiscal year compared to million in the fiscal year the nycomed agreement was completed in august  therefore this agreement had no impact to the fiscal year results 
the company does not expect the level of reimbursement from nycomed to continue at the level in clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were million  an increase of million or over  a result of the increased patient enrollment in clinical trials in  primarily for the clivatuzumab tetraxetan hpam trials 
clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were million  an increase of million or over this increase was a result of increased patient enrollment in clinical trials in personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to  primarily due to salary increases and higher staffing levels 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to  due primarily to salary increases 
this increase resulted from an increase in employee staffing levels over patent expenses for were million  a reduction of million or from this reduction was primarily due to the completion of patent related expenses for legal actions during the fiscal year  resulting in lower professional fees 
patent expenses for were million  a reduction of million or from this reduction resulted from an effort to control patent filings and support expenses  including bringing in a number of these services into the company  partially offset by high professional fees for patent litigation defense 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in  an increase of million or over the increase in was primarily due to manufacturing development requirements for veltuzumab product as part of the nycomed agreement and increased requirements to higher levels of clinical trial participation 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in  a decrease of million or over the reduction in was primarily due to the timing of material purchases 
expenses for outside testing were million in  an increase of million or from this increase was the result of increased testing for process validations and product safety testing for nycomed related manufacturing 
expenses for outside testing were million in  a decrease of million or from this decrease was primarily from the reduction of the number of tests performed for process validations and product safety in indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to development based on development spending levels increased by million or to million in fiscal year  primarily resulting from employee related costs 
indirect administrative and support services for fiscal year of million were comparable to the fiscal year 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient follow up in light of trials results  the number of clinical sites required for trials  and the number of patients that ultimately participate 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  immunomedics principal sources of funds have been the private and public sale of debt and equity securities and revenues from licensing 
there can be no assurance that immunomedics will be able to raise the additional capital it will need on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
if the company were unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended june  the decline in the current year s cash flow from operations is primarily the result of the million upfront payment from the completion of the nycomed agreement that occurred in fiscal year this decline in is partially offset by the receipt of million milestone payments earned from the nycomed agreement 
for fiscal year  despite the loss from operations of million for the year  the net cash used in operations was million lower than the loss on operations due to the receipt of million for the cash surrender value from the termination of executive life insurance policies in fiscal and non cash charges  primarily the million impairment charge on marketable securities and million of depreciation expense 
cash flows from investing 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  was million compared to  of net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended in fiscal year  million of proceeds was received from the sales of certain auction rate securities and million was received from the redemptions of certain auction rate securities  which were partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  proceeds of million were received from the redemptions of certain auction rate securities  offset by million of capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  was million  the net result of million in net proceeds of the sale of certain auction rate securities  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  was  which is comprised of million from the exercise of stock options  offset by the settlement of  employee stock options for million 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  was million  the result of the settlement of  employee stock options by the company 
for the year ended june   the net cash used in financing activities of million was primarily for the payment of debt 
at june   we had a working capital of million  representing an increase of million from the million working capital deficit at june  this increase in working capital in fiscal is primarily a result of the recognition in fiscal year of million of deferred revenue from the ucb and nycomed agreements which were classified as current liabilities as of june  and the cash proceeds from the sales and redemptions of million of auction rate securities during the fiscal year 
partially offsetting this increase in working capital was our use of cash in operations of million during the year 
at june   we had a working capital deficit of million  representing a decline of million from million of working capital at june  the decrease in working capital for the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year is primarily a result of the reclassification of our ars to non current assets at december  due to the existing market conditions and the failure of a market to develop for ars and the reclassification of million of the ucb agreement deferred revenue outstanding from long term to current  as the deferred revenue was reported as revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
partially offsetting these classification changes was the receipt of the million of upfront payment for the nycomed agreement in august  a portion of which million is included as deferred revenue in current liabilities in the balance sheet and which was recognized in the fiscal year 
the upfront proceeds from the nycomed agreement was utilized to fund the cash used in operations of million  which represents net income excluding the million of license fee revenue that was recognized under the nycomed agreement 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at june  represent an increase of million from million at june  our cash and cash equivalents of million at june   represent an increase of million from million at june  the increase for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the sales and redemptions of million of certain auction rate securities  partially offset by our use of cash in operations 
the increase for fiscal year was primarily attributable to our receipt of the million upfront payment from the nycomed agreement  partially offset by our use of cash in operations for the year ended june  subsequent to june   we received million in cash for the sale of one of the ars with a par value of million 
our remaining auction rate securities consist primarily of aaa rated securities that have an estimated fair value of million 
auctions for our invested amounts began failing in february and have not succeeded since then  and we have been unable to liquidate our auction rate securities at par 
in the event we need or desire to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
if a buyer is found  such buyer may only be willing to purchase the investments at a price below par 
further  rating downgrades of the security issuer or the third parties insuring such investments may further impact our ability to auction or sell these securities 
it is possible that the potential lack of liquidity in our auction rate security investments could adversely affect our ability to fund our future operations 
we cannot predict whether future auctions related to auction rate securities will be successful 
we are currently seeking alternatives for reducing our exposure to the auction rate market  but may not be able to identify any such alternative 
with the million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at june   we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months 
during fiscal  cash expenditures for our current research and development programs will be at a higher level than in fiscal year due to increased spending for research and development  lower reimbursement from nycomed and increased clinical trial activities  while a number of new clinical studies are supported by the company and our corporate partners 
we are also advancing plans to initiate a phase iii registration trial of veltuzumab in non hodgkin s lymphoma  for which we are considering a number of funding alternatives in the event we decide to begin this trial 
we expect research and development activities to continue to expand over time and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to complete our research and development compounds in our development pipeline in line with our corporate strategy 
as a result  we will continue to require additional financial resources in order to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of product candidates and regulatory filings 
our ability to raise capital through public and private debt or equity financings may be negatively impacted by the recent downturn in the economy 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available when we need it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional capital we will need on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  our ability to continue our business would be materially and adversely affected 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item a risk factors  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us  and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility and employment contracts in effect for our chairman of the board  chief medical officer and chief scientific officer and the president chief executive officer 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june payments due by period contractual obligation thereafter total in thousands operating lease employment contracts total in november  we renewed our operating lease for our morris plains  new jersey facility for an additional term of years expiring in october at a base annual rate of  which included an additional  square feet 
in june  we amended the lease agreement to add an additional  square feet of commercial office space to lease the entire facility  which we anticipate will occur by december  the lease is for the same lease term  expiring in october after the facility expansion takes effect  the base annual rate will be at  which rate is fixed through october and increases thereafter every five years 
included are employment contracts with both david m 
goldenberg  our chief medical officer and chief scientific officer  and cynthia sullivan  our president chief executive officer 
the four year employment contract with david m 
goldenberg was entered into effective july  this contract also included a minimum royalty agreement  a percentage of the consideration the company receives from licensing agreements  sales of intellectual properties and disposition of undeveloped assets  as disclosed in the employment agreement 
the amounts included above are only the minimum payments and do not include possible additional incentive compensation included in the employment contract 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance on revenue recognition related to multiple element arrangements 
this new guidance requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple element arrangements based on an element s estimated selling price if vendor specific or other third party evidence of value is not available 
this guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted retrospectively from the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
we do not expect this will have a significant impact our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification  which became the source of us generally accepted accounting principles to be applied to nongovernmental entities 
the codification superseded all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  since it is not intended to change or alter existing us gaap  this pronouncement did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures 
this new guidance requires companies to separately disclose information about the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect this will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
during the early part of  securities known as auction rate securities ars  which historically have had a liquid market and had their interest rates reset periodically eg  monthly through dutch auctions  began to fail 
these widespread failures have continued to date 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and the company will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or a buyer is found outside of the auction process  of which there is no assurance 
as of june   the company has million invested in ars with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each month 
the company s investments in ars all currently have aaa aaa credit ratings and interest continues to be paid by the issuers of the securities 
the ars held are all aaa rated collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and backed by insurance companies 
the estimated fair market value at june   of the company s ars with continuing auction failures totaled approximately million 
subsequent to june  we sold one of the ars with a par value of million in a secondary market at a discounted value of million 
the other two auction rate securities are not currently liquid and the company will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process  of which there is no assurance 
the company estimated the fair value of the remaining auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of its investment in ars as of june  the company reviews for impairment in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
this treatment is appropriate when a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and the company has the intent and ability to hold the investment until a recovery in market value takes place 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio in marketable securities as of june  expected maturity date and thereafter total fair value in thousands variable rate average interest rate we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in regards to certain agreements with service providers relating to certain clinical trials that are in process 
depending on the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  realized and unrealized currency fluctuations could be significant
