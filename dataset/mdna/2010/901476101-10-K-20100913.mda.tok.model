for the year ended june   the company generated net cash from operating activities of million 
as of june   the company also had cash of million  primarily at its overseas operations

in the third fiscal quarter  the company used roughly million of cash at its european operations to pay down some of its local debt 
in fiscal  the company expects to contribute  to its defined benefit plans  the minimum contributions required 
however  if the company elects to make voluntary contributions in fiscal  it intends to do so using cash from operations and  if necessary  from available borrowings under existing credit facilities 
net working capital decreased approximately million  or  in fiscal  and the current ratio decreased to at june  from at june  the decrease in net working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories 
twin disc expects capital expenditures to be between and million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect the company s plans to continue investing in modern equipment and facilities  its global sourcing program and new products 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and potential access to debt markets will be adequate to fund twin disc s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases  as of june  and the company has obligations under non cancelable operating lease contracts and loan and senior note agreements for certain future payments 
a summary of those commitments follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years revolving loan borrowing long term debt operating leases the table above does not include tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling  excluding related interest and penalties  as the timing of their resolution cannot be estimated 
see note n of the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions 
the company maintains defined benefit pension plans for some of its operations in the united states and europe 
the company has established the pension committee to manage the operations and administration of the defined benefit plans 
the company estimates that fiscal contributions to all defined benefit plans will total other matters critical accounting policies the preparation of this annual report requires management s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts recei vable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
goodwill in conformity with us gaap  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might exist 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at june  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying value  including goodwill and as such  no impairment existed at that time 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions  economic factors and or market indicators could change the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units and  therefore  impairment charges could be required in the future 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care coverage 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality tables  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate based on the hewitt top quartile yield curve at june  as applied to the expected payouts from the pension plans 
this yield curve is made up of corporate bonds rated aa or better 
expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase reflect the long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates based upon the generational mortality table for fiscal  and health care cost trend rates developed based upon historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate
