item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we believe that coast is one of the largest wholesale suppliers of replacement parts  supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles rvs and boats in north america 
we supply more than  products and serve more than  customers throughout the united states and canada  from regional distribution centers in the united states and regional distribution centers in canada 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers collectively  aftermarket customers 
factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products our sales are affected primarily by i the usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom our aftermarket customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new and used rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at or shortly after the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers  their confidence about economic conditions which affects their willingness to use and purchase rvs and boats and the availability and the costs of credit that our aftermarket customers rely upon to purchase products from us and which consumers often use to finance their purchases of rvs and boats 
as a result  recessionary conditions and a tightening in the availability or increases in the costs of borrowings to consumers often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
additionally  increases in the prices and shortages in the supply of gasoline can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats  because these conditions increase the consumers costs and the difficulties of using their rvs and boats 
weather conditions also can affect our operating results  because unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions can reduce the usage of rvs and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions and can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  affected by recessionary economic conditions  tightening in the availability and increases in the costs of consumer and business financing  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline and unusually adverse weather conditions

overview of fiscal operating results the following table provides information comparing our results of operations in the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operation in fiscal and fiscal dollars are in thousands  except per share data 
year ended december  amount amount amount increase decrease vs 
increase decrease vs 
amount percent amount percent net sales gross profits sg a expenses operating income loss interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted as indicated in the table above  our sales decreased in the year ended december  as compared to that decrease was primarily attributable to the continuance of the economic recession and rising rates of unemployment  coupled with reductions in the availability of credit  in the united states and canada during  which caused a decline in consumer confidence and significant reductions in discretionary spending by consumers on which purchases and the usage of rvs and boats  and the demand for the products we sell  depend 

table of contents notwithstanding these economic and market conditions and their adverse impact on our sales  we were able to increase our operating income  pre tax earnings and our net earnings during the year ended december  by million  million and million  respectively  to million  million and million  respectively  from an operating loss of million  a pre tax loss of million and a net loss of million in these improvements in our operating results in were primarily attributable to i a modest increase in our gross margin and ii reductions in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses and in our interest expense 
gross margin 
we were able to achieve a modest increase our gross margin in to  from in  despite the decline in net sales  primarily as a result of i a reduction in shipping costs due to decreases in the price of fuel  ii a reduction in cash discounts and rebates offered to our customers  iii a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products sourced from asia  and iv reductions in warehouse labor and other distribution costs 
operating expenses 
we implemented a number of measures to reduce our sg a expenses  beginning in the third quarter of  when it became apparent that the economic recession had become more severe and would continue well into among other things  we implemented staff reductions and a across the board reduction in management compensation and employee wages 
our operating results reflect the first full year of the positive effects of the cost cutting measures implemented in  by which we were able to reduce sg a expenses by million  or  over interest expense 
we reduced our interest expense in the year ended december  by million  or  to million  from million in  as a result of i reductions in inventory and in other working capital requirements that enabled us to reduce our reliance on bank borrowings  and ii lower market rates of interest which determine the rate of interest charged on our bank borrowings 
outlook for the continuing concerns and uncertainties among businesses and consumers regarding the ultimate severity and duration of the economic recession  persistent high rates of unemployment and the limited availability of small business and consumer financing have continued into we expect these conditions to continue to adversely affect the purchase and usage by consumers of rvs and boats and  therefore  also the purchases  both by consumers and our aftermarket customers of the products that we sell  during in addition  our bank loan agreement was amended during  largely due to the tightening of available business credit and the impact of the economic recession on our operating results 
that amendment reduced the maximum amount of borrowings we can obtain under our revolving bank credit line and increased the costs to us of such borrowings 
these amendments also may adversely affect our net sales because we may not be able to purchase as much inventory of the products we sell  which could adversely affect our service levels to our customers  and we may have to tighten the credit that we can extend to our aftermarket customers in connection with their purchases of products from us 
our strategic goals for are to capture additional market share in order to offset declines in net sales attributable to these difficult economic and market conditions  and to improve our gross margin  despite these conditions  primarily by continuing to increase our sales of higher margin proprietary products and other foreign sourced products 
in addition  in response to this difficult economic climate  we are continuing to monitor our sg a expenses 
as a result  we believe that we can achieve a modest improvement in our operating results in  as compared to  assuming that economic and market conditions in the united states and canada stabilize and the availability of credit to businesses and consumers increases 
on the other hand  if such conditions do not begin to improve in  it may become necessary for us to implement additional cost cutting measures  which could include the closing of one or more of our distribution centers 
due to the risks in the economy and in our business and the uncertainties that exist regarding future economic and market conditions  it is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy whether we will succeed in achieving our goals for see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for a discussion of some of those risks and uncertainties 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including judgments or assumptions we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance  and those judgments and assumptions are  in turn  based on current information available to us 
if those conditions or trends were to change in ways that we did not expect  then based on our assessment of how those changes will affect the prospects for realizing the values at which we have recorded these assets  we may be required  pursuant to gaap  to further adjust the carrying values at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets affected by the changed conditions 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to these assets 
examples include an allowance established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves  an allowance for inventory obsolescence and a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset to the extent necessary to reduce its carrying value to the amount of that asset that we believe we are likely to be able to use to reduce our income tax liability in future periods 
the amounts at which those allowances are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or trends and any other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
we periodically increase or replenish the allowances following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in the allowances are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in the periods when those allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market and economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or changes in economic or market conditions  such as increasing gasoline prices or interest rates or economic downturns  will be of short or long term duration  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  we make such estimates based upon the information available to us at that time and reevaluate and adjust the reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded  based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 

table of contents our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are included in revenue and our shipping and handling costs are included in costs of sales 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit product for return 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we sometimes grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible accounts receivable in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events or circumstances that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting the ability of customers to make payments to us on a timely basis  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory and reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
we are a wholesale distributor and not a manufacturer of products and  therefore  all of our inventory consists of finished goods 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines and estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and trends 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary for us to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which we operate  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were  at december   as compared to  at december  deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce the amounts of our income taxes in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  such tax benefits will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us that it is more likely that than not that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in their entirety prior to their expiration  then  we would establish or increase any existing valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount that we believe we will be able to utilize 
that reduction is implemented by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that would be recorded in our statement of operations 
at december  and december   the aggregate amounts of our net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any of those assets may not be recoverable in full  by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset to its carrying amount 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our canadian and other foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation as an expense in the calculation of net income loss 
the company recognizes stock compensation expense in the period in which the employee is required to provide service  which is generally over the vesting period of the individual equity instruments 
stock options issued in lieu of cash to non employees for services performed are recorded at the fair value of the options at the time they are issued and are expensed as service is provided 
stock based compensation expense in the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
warranty costs 
we generally do not independently warrant the products that we distribute 
instead  in almost all cases  the manufacturers of the products that we distribute warrant the products and allow us to return defective products  including those that have been returned to us by our customers 
however  we sell a line of portable and standby generators under a product supply arrangement which obligates us to provide warranty services for these products and to share the costs of providing those services with the manufacturer 
the duration of the warranty period for these products is months following the sale of the product to a retail customer 
we established warranty reserves for these products of  and  at december  and  respectively 
those amounts were determined on the basis of a number of factors  including our estimates of future sales of the products that we warrant and our historical and expected future warranty claims experience 
in the event changes occur in the conditions or circumstances upon which those assumptions and estimates were made  it could become necessary for us to increase the reserve by means of a charge to our income 
recent accounting pronouncements with the exception of those discussed below  there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended december   that we believe are of significance  or potential significance to the company based upon current operations 
in june  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap 
it also explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the sec under federal securities laws as authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
we adopted this codification in the three months ended september  adoption of this codification has not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued guidance that establishes new accounting and reporting standards with respect to an entity s non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this guidance requires that a non controlling minority interest in a subsidiary be reported by its parent entity as equity  rather than as a liability  on the parent entity s balance sheet 
additionally  this guidance requires disclosure with respect to the consolidated net income attributable to the parent entity and to the non controlling interest in a subsidiary  respectively  to be set forth on the face of the parent entity s income statement 
the guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we adopted the guidance effective as of january  that adoption has not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance which provides for the elimination of the concept of qualifying special purpose entities 
it also replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has i the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity  ii the right to receive benefits from 
table of contents that entity and iii the obligation to absorb any losses incurred by such an entity 
additionally  the guidance requires an ongoing assessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the guidance became effective for the company on january  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
effective april   we adopted the fasb s guidance on subsequent events 
that guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  material events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
in october  the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times 
specifically  this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists 
the new rules are effective for us beginning january  we are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  we adopted the applicable sections of the fasb s guidance on earnings per share that addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
these sections conclude that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of basic earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
we do not believe that the adoption of these applicable sections will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued new guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  as well as requiring the presentation  on a gross basis  of information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in level fair value measurements 
this guidance also clarifies existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation  inputs and valuation techniques 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and will be effective for the company on march  disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will be effective for the company on march  results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net sales  derived from our statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses operating income loss interest expense earnings loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss net sales net sales consist of revenues from the sales of the products we supply or distribute  net of an allowance for product returns 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the decreases in our net sales in fiscal and dollars in the table are in thousands 
percent change vs 
percent change vs 

table of contents the decreases in net sales in and  in each case as compared to the immediately preceding year  were primarily attributable to declines in purchases and in the usage of rvs and boats 
those declines were primarily attributable to the economic recession  the resulting high levels of unemployment  and the credit crisis in the united states and canada during and these conditions combined to reduce disposable income of and confidence among consumers about the future which  in turn  have caused consumers to reduce their purchases and their usage of rvs and boats and  as a result  their purchases of the products we sell 
gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the costs of sales from net sales 
costs of sales consist primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  inbound freight charges  merchandise receiving  handling and storage costs  and out bound freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales 
dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin due to decrease in our net sales in  gross profits declined by nearly million  or  in as compared to notwithstanding that decline  our gross margin improved to in from in  due to a combination of factors  including i a reduction in shipping costs due to decreases in the price of fuel  ii a reduction in cash discounts and rebates offered to our customers  iii a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products sourced from asia  and v reductions in warehouse labor and other distribution costs 
the decline in gross profits in also was attributable to the decrease in net sales in that year as compared to however  despite that decline in the dollar amount of gross profits in  our gross margin remained largely unchanged in  as compared to  due primarily to i price increases that we implemented on selected products  ii a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products sourced from asia and iii the strengthening of the canadian dollar  which resulted in a reduction in the costs of products purchased by our canadian subsidiary and  therefore  an increases in its gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  and administrative labor and other administrative expenses  professional fees  insurance and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
dollars in thousands sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales we reduced our sg a expenses in absolute dollars  by  or in  as compared to in addition  despite the decline in net sales in  our sg a expenses also declined as a percentage of net sales in these reductions in sg a expenses in reflect a full year of the positive effects of cost cutting measures that we implemented in the second half of in response to the worsening of the economic recession and the credit crisis  including i workforce reductions  ii reductions in management salaries and employee wages  and iii reductions in selling and marketing and other administrative expenses 
in  we were able to reduce our sg a expenses in absolute dollars by  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of the implementation of those same cost cutting measures  beginning in the third quarter of the year  in response to the worsening of the economic recession and credit crisis that resulted in the decline in our net sales in however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses rose to in as compared to in  because those cost cutting measures were not able to fully offset the decline in net sales in 
table of contents the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income loss dollars in thousands operating income loss as a percentage of net sales we generated operating income of million in  an improvement of million from the loss from operations of million incurred in that improvement was the result of the increase in gross margin and the reduction in sg a expenses  which more than offset the effects on our operating results of the decrease in net sales in the loss from operations in was due primarily to the decreases in net sales and gross profits  which more than offset the reduction in sg a expenses in other expense year ended december  dollars in thousands other expense interest expense other expense total the largest component of other expense is the interest expense that we incur on borrowings 
the other component of other expense consists primarily of foreign currency gains or losses and gains or losses on disposal of assets 
interest expense decreased by  or  in  as compared to and by  or in  as compared to these decreases were primarily the result of reductions in our average outstanding borrowings and decreases in the average rate of interest charged on borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit 
we were able to reduce our average outstanding borrowings in both and  primarily as a result of reductions i in inventories due not only to the decrease in net sales  but also to efficiencies we achieved in our warehouse and distribution operations  and ii in accounts receivable due to the decline in net sales and our implementation of more stringent credit standards in response to the economic recession 
the interest rate on our bank borrowings is tied to market rates of interest and the decrease in the rates of interest charged on our bank borrowings during and were primarily attributable to interest rate reductions implemented by the board of governors of the federal reserve system in response to the economic recession  which led most banks including our bank lender to reduce their prime interest rates 
income tax provision benefit year ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit as a percentage of net sales effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected primarily by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes  such as stock based compensation expense  and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries  because tax rates in their respective countries vary  sometimes considerably  from income tax rates in the united states 

table of contents due to the pre tax profits that we generated in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for  as compared to a tax benefit of nearly million in see critical accounting policies and use of estimates our accounting policies deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources working capital  liquidity and cash flows we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds 
see sources and uses of cash below 
the bank line of credit provides that we may borrow up to the lesser of i  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
interest on our borrowings under the revolving line of credit is payable at the bank s prime rate plus or  at our option but subject to certain limitations  at libor plus per annum 
the maturity date of the bank line of credit is july   which as previously reported was extended from may  pursuant to an amendment agreement entered into with the bank lender on november  the revolving bank line of credit agreement contains a quarterly pre tax income covenant through march and a fixed charge covenant beginning june at december  we were  and we expect that at march  we will be  in compliance with the quarterly pre tax income covenant 
the fixed charge coverage ratio will require us to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least i to for the six months ending june   ii to for the nine months ending september  and iii to for the year ending december  and for rolling month periods ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets and rank senior in priority to any other indebtedness that the company may incur 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with  day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  we sometimes provide our most creditworthy customers with payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and fourth quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
sources and uses of cash we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
cash provided by operations in during  our operations provided cash of million  comprised of a million reduction in inventory  a million reduction in prepaid expenses  non cash expenses of million  a million reduction in accounts receivable  and net earnings of million  net of cash used to fund million reduction in accounts payable and million reduction in accrued liabilities 
cash used by financing activities in during  we used nearly million of cash for financing activities principally to fund the repayment of long term debt under our revolving bank line of credit 
cash flows used in investing activities in we used million of cash in investing activities in  principally to fund capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  testing and design  and computer equipment 

table of contents contractual obligations lease obligations 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately million 
the following table sets forth our future operating lease commitments in thousands of dollars  as of december  year ending december  thereafter total and maturity of contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total and the maturities of our contractual obligations  in thousands of dollars  at december  maturities of contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  total of contractual obligations less than one year more than one and less than four years four to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations totals consists primarily of borrowings under our bank credit facility  which matures in july our long term debt obligations consist primarily of borrowings under our long term revolving bank credit facility 
it is not possible to calculate future estimated interest payments on those borrowing predictably  because the amounts of such borrowings fluctuate throughout the year depending on our liquidity needs  which can vary widely primarily due to the seasonality of our business and the effects of prevailing economic conditions on the demand for and the purchases of our products by customers 
also  the interest rate on those borrowings is determined by reference to the bank s prime rate or libor  which also can and often do fluctuate during the year 
additionally  the formulas for determining the specific interest rate that will apply to such borrowings can change from year to year 
set forth above  under the caption financial condition  liquidity and capital resources are the formulas for determining the interest rates that will apply to those borrowings during the fiscal year ending december  dividend policy and dividend payments 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provided for the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders in the amount of per share 
the amounts of the quarterly dividends were increased by our board of directors to per share in and to per share in in  and we paid total cash dividends of   and  respectively 
in november  our board of directors suspended the payment of cash dividends in order to preserve cash for operations in response to the worsening of the economic recession and the tightening of credit by banks and other lending institutions to businesses  as well as consumers 
additionally  our revolving bank line of credit agreement prohibits us from paying cash dividends without the prior approval of our bank lender 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends at least for the foreseeable future 
share repurchases 
in  our board of directors adopted a share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of  of our shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
we made no share repurchases pursuant to those programs during during and  we made share repurchases totaling  and  respectively 
our revolving bank line of credit agreement prohibits us from repurchasing our shares without the prior approval of our bank lender 
as a result  we do not anticipate resuming purchases of our shares at least for the foreseeable future 

table of contents expected uses and sources of funds we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range from  to  we expect that these expenditures will be of a recurring nature  for such purposes as the replacement and upgrading of warehouse or computer equipment in the ordinary course of our business 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures and our working capital requirements with borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds  assuming that there is not a further worsening of the economic recession in see item a of part i of this report above  entitled risk factors our business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business  which makes us more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in part i of this report 
we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our sales and our market share and to improve our profit margins by  among other things  establishing new product supply relationships that enable us to increase the products that we source from lower cost  but high quality  overseas suppliers  including product suppliers in asia  and to invest in tooling needed for such products 
we also may seek to take advantage of other growth opportunities if and when they may arise 
as a result  we may have occasion in the future to use internally generated funds or bank borrowings for these purposes 
there is no assurance  however  that  if required  we will be able to obtain bank borrowings for these purposes 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
we generate significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august  when usage of rvs and boats are at their peak  than we do during the remainder of the year when weather conditions are not optimal for outdoor activities 
because a substantial portion our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we may incur losses  and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements  during the period from september through february when our sales are lower 
the following tables presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report

march  june  september  december unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted march  june  september  december unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted as the above table indicates  the economic recession and the tightening in the availability of business and consumer credit had a particularly adverse effect on our sales during we were able to offset the effect of this sales decline by increasing our gross margin and reducing our operating expenses 
inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit of million 
we have substantial sales operations in canada and as a result  our earnings  cash flows and financial position can be affected by movements in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
consequently  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
therefore  from time to time  we may hedge the net investment of our foreign operations in canada by purchasing foreign exchange derivatives  such as purchased put option contracts  to mitigate the risk of changes in value of our net investment in our canadian subsidiary that can occur as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we held no foreign currency derivatives 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes
