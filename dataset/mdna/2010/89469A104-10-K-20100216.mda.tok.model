item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we believe we are the largest manufacturer of non dairy powdered creamer and pickles in the united states  and the largest manufacturer of private label salad dressings in the united states and canada  based upon total sales volumes 
in  based on available industry data  private label products sold in the retail grocery channel in the united states  which compete with branded products on the basis of equivalent quality at a lower price  represented approximately of all pickle products  approximately of all non dairy powdered creamer  approximately of all salad dressings and approximately of all canned soup 

table of contents we sell our products primarily to the retail grocery and foodservice channels 
for the year ended december   sales to the retail grocery and foodservice channels represented and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
the remaining represented industrial and export sales 
a majority of our sales are private label products 
we intend to grow our business profitably through the following strategic initiatives expand partnerships with retailers 
as grocery retailers become more demanding of their private label food product suppliers  they have come to expect strategic insight  product innovation  customer service and logistical economies of scale similar to those of our branded competitors 
to this end  we are continually developing  investing in and expanding our private label food product offerings and capabilities in these areas 
in addition to our low cost manufacturing  we have invested in research and development  product and packaging innovation  category management  information technology systems and other capabilities 
we believe that these investments enable us to provide a broad and growing array of private label food products that generally meet or exceed the value and quality of branded competitors that have comparable sales  marketing  innovation and category management support 
we believe that we are well positioned to expand our market share with grocery retailers given our differentiated capabilities  breadth of product offering and geographic reach 
continue to drive growth and profitability from our existing product portfolio 
we believe we can continue to drive strong organic growth from our existing product portfolio 
through insights gained from our eva economic value added analyses  we develop operating strategies that enable us to focus our resources and investments on products and categories that we believe offer the highest potential 
additionally  eva analyses identify products and categories that lag the broader portfolio and require corrective action 
we believe eva analysis is a helpful tool which maximizes the full potential of our product offerings 
leverage cross selling opportunities across customers  sales channels and geographies 
while we have high private label food product market shares in the united states for our non dairy powdered creamer  soup  salad dressing and pickles  as well as high branded and private label food product market share in jams in canada  we believe we still have significant potential for growth with grocery retailers and foodservice distributors that we either currently serve in a limited manner  or do not currently serve 
we believe that our size and scale give us an advantage over smaller private label food product producers  many of whom provide only a single category or service to a single customer or geography 
our ability to service customers across north america and across a wider spectrum of products and capabilities provides many opportunities for cross selling to customers who seek to reduce the number of private label food product suppliers they utilize 
growth through acquisitions 
we believe we have the expertise and demonstrated ability to identify and integrate value enhancing acquisitions 
we selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses that we believe are a compelling strategic fit with our existing operations 
each potential acquisition is vigorously evaluated for merit utilizing a rigorous analysis that assesses targets for their market attractiveness  intrinsic value and strategic fit 
we believe our past acquisitions of oxford foods  the del monte soup and infant feeding business  san antonio farms  degraffenreid  and ed smith were each a success and consistent with our strategy 
since we began operating as an independent company in  our acquisitions have significantly added to our revenue base  enhanced margins and allowed us to expand from an initial base of two center of store  shelf stable food categories to eight  including sturm 
we attempt to maintain conservative financial policies when pursuing acquisitions  and our proven integration strategies have resulted in rapid deleveraging 
by identifying targets that fit within our defined strategies  we believe we can continue to expand our product selection and continue our efforts to be the low cost  high quality and innovative supplier of private label food products for our customers

the company s exposure to foreign exchange rates is primarily limited to the canadian dollar

freight out and commissions paid to independent brokers increased by million to million as a result of increased fuel costs early in however  these costs decreased as a percent of revenue from in to in due to combining shipments and leveraging freight rates with the other product lines 
known trends and uncertainties prices of raw materials we were adversely affected by rising input costs during and  however  during certain input costs decreased from these high levels 
many of the raw materials used in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
fluctuating fuel costs also impacted our results 
while prices for many of our raw materials decreased during from their historic highs reached in the prior year  the company expects moderate price volatility for the next year with an upward trend 
we manage the impact  wherever possible  on commercially reasonable terms  by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements 
in addition  we offset the effect by raising prices to our customers 
however  for competitive reasons  we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them 
in addition  in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs 

table of contents competitive environment there has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years  and mass merchandisers are gaining market share 
as our customer base continues to consolidate  we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer  large customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers  or gain new customers 
as the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industry continues  we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold 
both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment in the retail and foodservice channels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future

the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of the company believes it has sufficient liquidity  after considering the debt requirements of the sturm acquisition  and does not anticipate a significant risk to cash flows in the foreseeable future despite the current 
table of contents disruption of the credit markets  because the company operates in a relatively stable industry and has sizable market share across its product lines 
the company s long term financing needs will depend largely on potential acquisition activity 
the impact of the reduction in equity values of the stock market in late and early resulted in a reduced funded balance of our pension plan  and required additional cash contributions in  which was funded by cash flows from operations 
the company contributed million in and expects to make contributions of approximately million in seasonality the company s short term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital during the year 
due to the seasonality of cucumber and fruit production driven by harvest cycles  which occur primarily during the spring and summer  inventories generally are at a low point in late spring and at a high point during the fall  increasing our working capital requirements

the timing of cash settlement for this portion  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated due to offsetting positions and conclusions upon audit 
the company s gross unrealized tax benefit is approximately million 
the difference between the gross unrealized tax benefit and the fin liability is due to the inclusion of corollary positions  interest  penalties  as well as the impact of state taxes on the federal tax liability  which are included in the computation of the fin liability but not the gross unrecognized tax benefit

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment 
in certain circumstances  however  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounts receivable allowances we maintain an allowance for customer promotional programs  marketing co op programs and other sales and marketing expenses 
this allowance is based on historical rolling twelve month average program activity and can fluctuate due to the level of sales and marketing programs  and timing of deductions

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets totaled million as of december   resulting primarily from acquisitions 
upon acquisition  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including but not limited to trademarks and customer related intangible assets  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks are not amortized 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  our reporting units are defined as north american retail grocery us  north american retail grocery canada  food away from home us  food away from home canada  industrial bulk and co pack us  and co pack canada 
we believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
if these perpetual trademark criteria are not met  the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives 
determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a 
table of contents number of factors including the competitive environment  market share  trademark history and anticipated future trademark support 
indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently  if other events occur  to ensure that fair value continues to exceed the related book value 
an indefinite lived trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds fair value 
goodwill impairment is indicated if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
if the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value  the asset is written down to fair value  which is generally based on its discounted future cash flows 
future business results could impact the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis as of december  our assessment did not result in goodwill impairment 
we have seven reporting units  five of which contain goodwill totaling million 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach  with each method given equal weighting 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied  with the weighted average of all discount rates being equal to the total company discount rate 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
further supporting our assessment of goodwill is the fact that our company s stock price has increased from december  to december  by approximately 
of the five reporting units with goodwill  three have fair values significantly in excess of their carrying values between and  while another reporting unit has a fair value that is approximately in excess of its carrying value 
our final reporting unit  retail grocery canada  has a fair value that is approximately in excess of its carrying value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
we reviewed our indefinite lived intangible assets  which include our trademarks totaling million  using the relief from royalty method 
significant assumptions include the royalty  growth and discount rates 
our assumptions were based on historical performance and management estimates of future performance  as well as available data on licenses of similar products 
our analysis resulted in no impairment 
the company s policy is that indefinite lived assets must have a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
when these criteria are no longer met  the company changes the classification 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
amortizable intangible assets which include primarily customer relationships and trademarks are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment  the asset is written down to its fair value  which is generally based on discounted future cash flows 
we reviewed our amortizable intangible assets and our analysis resulted in the impairment of our nature s goodness trademark totaling million  and is related to the north american retail grocery us segment 
no other impairment was identified and the company concluded no changes are necessary to the remaining useful lives or values of the remaining amortizable intangible assets as of december  purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
all identifiable assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles  and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the purchase price of the acquired company  normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
we record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation 
to the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase 
table of contents price allocations  such differences would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including quoted market prices  forecast of expected cash flows  net realizable values  estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period  which would have an impact on our earnings 
future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
stock based compensation income from continuing operations before income taxes  for the years ended december  and december   included share based compensation expense for employee and director stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units  and performance units of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock unit awards and performance units the awards is determined on the date of grant 
stock options were valued using a black scholes model and certain restricted stock and restricted stock units were valued using a monte carlo simulation 
performance units and all other restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards were valued using the closing price of the company s stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded  could have been impacted  if other assumptions were used 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be impacted in future periods 
as the company s stock was not publicly traded prior to june   expected volatilities are based on the implied historical volatilities from peer companies and other factors 
the company has estimated that certain employees will complete the required service conditions associated with certain awards 
for all other employees  the company estimates forfeitures as not all employees are expected to complete the required service conditions 
the expected service period is the longer of the derived service period  as determined from the output of the valuation models  and the service period based on the term of the awards 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
as the company does not have significant history to determine the expected term of its option awards  we based the expected term on that of comparable companies 
the assumptions used to calculate the option and restricted stock awards granted in are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance accruals we retain selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers having high deductible limits 
in other areas  we are self insured with stop loss coverage 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables  including claims history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are based on industry factors and  along with the estimated liabilities  are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
changes in loss development factors  claims history and cost trends could result in substantially different results in the future 
employee benefit plan costs we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  
table of contents employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends  when it is deemed appropriate 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
our current asset mix guidelines  under our investment policy as written by our investment committee  target equities at to of the portfolio and fixed income at to 
at december   our master trust was invested as follows equity securities of  fixed income securities of  and cash and cash equivalents of 
we determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plan s investments based on target allocations of the pension plan s investments 
additionally  we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model and historical returns on comparable equity  debt and other investments 
the resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 
while a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature  including assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and mortality rates  generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions 
as such  our discount rate will likely change more frequently 
we used a discount rate to determine our estimated future benefit obligations of  at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee pension and retirement benefit plans 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations the company entered into a million long term interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of november  to lock into a fixed libor interest rate base 
under the terms of the agreement  million in floating rate debt was swapped for a fixed interest base rate for a period of months  amortizing to million for an additional nine months at the same interest rate 
under the terms of the company s revolving credit agreement  and in conjunction with our credit spread  this will result in an all in borrowing cost on the swapped principal being no more than during the life of the swap agreement 
in july  we entered into a forward interest rate swap transaction for a notational amount of million as a hedge of the forecasted private placement of million in senior notes 
the interest rate swap transaction was terminated on august   which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the unamortized loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the total loss will be reclassified ratably to the consolidated statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the senior notes  providing an effective interest rate of over the terms of the senior notes 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hold any derivative financial instruments  other than our interest rate swap agreement  as of december   which could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase in the amount of interest expense we expect to pay with respect to our revolving credit facility  which is tied to variable market rates which includes libor and prime interest rates 
based on our outstanding debt balance of million under our revolving credit facility  and adjusting for the million fixed rate swap 
table of contents agreement  as of december   each rise in our interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
input costs the costs of raw materials  as well as packaging materials and fuel  have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
we experienced increases in certain costs such as metal caps  cans and lids and meat products in compared to  however  these increases were more than offset by decreases in the cost of oils  casein and plastic containers 
in addition  fuel costs  which represent the most important factor affecting utility costs at our production facilities and our transportation costs  rose to unusually high levels in the middle of  but have decreased proportionately to the general reduction in overall economic activity in the most important raw material used in our pickle operations is cucumbers 
we purchase cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers strategically located to supply our production facilities 
bad weather or disease in a particular growing area can damage or destroy the crop in that area  which would impair crop yields 
if we are not able to buy cucumbers from local suppliers  we would likely either purchase cucumbers from foreign sources  such as mexico or india  or ship cucumbers from other growing areas in the united states  thereby increasing our production costs 
changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials 
competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials  packaging and fuel costs 
accordingly  if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material  packaging and fuel costs  our operating profits and margins could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into pricing at higher costs
