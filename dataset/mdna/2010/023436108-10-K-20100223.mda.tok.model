index to financial statements payment the united states congress is continuing to consider legislation as part of the fiscal budget that could impact the amounts that we are paid by medicare for home health services provided to medicare eligible patients 
as of the date of this filing  the legislation has not been finalized and thus we cannot estimate the impact of such potential changes but we continue to monitor these actions closely 
on october   cms adjusted the base episodic rate for with a market basket increase  a increase resulting from a modification to the current outlier policy and a negative case mix adjustment 
the net effect of these changes increased the base rate for by to  the revised outlier policy includes a cap on outlier payments of per provider and targets total aggregate outlier payments at of total home health payments 
during  the percentage of our outlier episodes to completed episodes was  therefore  we do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
on august   cms issued a final rule to update and revise the medicare hospice wage index for fiscal year the final rule revises the phase out of the hospice budget neutrality adjustment to a reduction of the hospice budget neutrality adjustment in fiscal year and a reduction annually for fiscal years through cms also included a market basket update which offset by the reduction of the hospice budget neutrality adjustment  increased the medicare hospice rate by

the decrease in our internal episodic based admission growth from in to in is primarily due to the inclusion of the tlc acquired agencies in our internal growth metric beginning in the second quarter of as is typical with our large acquisitions  we do experience a loss in admissions as we rapidly convert agencies to our platform 
we anticipate improving the internal growth at these agencies in our rate of recertification will vary based on the clinical needs of our patients

our base or mature agencies are primarily concentrated in the southeastern part of the united states  as compared to our recent acquisitions  which include states outside of our southeastern concentration 
these other states have a higher wage index compared to our base agencies  which results in higher labor costs 
additionally  often the agencies we acquire pay visiting staff on a salary basis rather than on a per visit basis

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice agencies by providing a variety of services almost exclusively in the homes of our patients 
this net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis on a day episode of care basis for home health services and on a day episode of care basis for the first two hospice episodes of care and on a day episode of care basis for any subsequent hospice episodes  on a per visit basis or on a daily basis depending upon the payment terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided 
we refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a day episode of care as episodic based revenue 
for the services we provide  medicare is our largest payor 

table of contents 
index to financial statements when we record our service revenue  we record it net of estimated revenue adjustments and contractual adjustments to reflect amounts we estimate to be realizable for services provided  as discussed below 
we believe  based on information currently available to us and based on our judgment  that changes to one or more factors that impact the accounting estimates such as our estimates related to revenue adjustments  contractual adjustments and episodes in progress we make in determining net service revenue  which changes are likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or our future financial results 
home health revenue recognition medicare revenue net service revenue is recorded under the pps medicare payment program based on a day episode payment rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables including  but not limited  to a an outlier payment if our patient s care was unusually costly  b lupa if the number of visits was fewer than five  c a partial payment if our patient transferred to another provider or we received a patient from another provider before completing the episode  d a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required thresholds set at  and visits  e the number of episodes of care provided to a patient  regardless of whether the same home health provider provided care for the entire series of episodes  f changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  g adjustments to the base episode payments for case mix and geographic wages  and h recoveries of overpayments 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of such payment adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over on medicare claims  and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable 
therefore  we believe that our reported net service revenue and patient accounts receivable will be the net amounts to be realized from medicare for services rendered 
for  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in estimated revenue adjustments to medicare revenue 
in addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes  we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress 
episodes in progress are day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period  but were not completed as of the end of the period 
we estimate this revenue on a monthly basis based upon historical trends 
the primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period  expected medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on visits performed 
as of december  and  the difference between the cash received from medicare for a rap on episodes in progress and the associated estimated revenue was included as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets for such periods  since only a nominal amount represents cash collected in advance of providing services 
non medicare revenue episodic based revenue 
we recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize medicare revenue for episodic based rates that are paid by other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  however  these rates can vary based upon the negotiated terms 
non episodic based revenue 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the contracted rates realizable from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and are also recorded as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
in addition  we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment

index to financial statements hospice revenue recognition hospice medicare revenue gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates 
the estimated payment rates are daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver 
the four main levels of care we provide are routine care  general inpatient care  continuous home care and respite care 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of these adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes our historical collection rate on medicare claims  and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
additionally  as medicare is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap  we monitor our provider numbers and estimate amounts due back to medicare if a cap has been exceeded 
we record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and increase other accrued liabilities 
as of december  and  we had million recorded for estimated amounts due back to medicare in other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of our adjustments we believe our revenue and patients accounts receivable are recorded at amounts that will be ultimately realized 
hospice non medicare revenue we record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be realizable from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and patient accounts receivable 
patient accounts receivable our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from medicare  medicaid  other third party payors and patients 
we believe there is a certain level of credit risk associated with non medicare payors 
to provide for our non medicare patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value 
we believe the credit risk associated with our medicare accounts  which represents and of our net patient accounts receivable at december  and  respectively is limited due to i our historical collection rate of over from medicare and ii the fact that medicare is a us government payor 
accordingly  we do not record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our medicare patient accounts receivable which are recorded at their net realizable value after recording estimated revenue adjustments as discussed above 
there is no other single payor  other than medicare that accounts for more than of our total outstanding patient receivables  and thus we believe there are no other significant concentrations of receivables that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable 
we fully reserve for accounts  which are aged at days or greater 
we write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be uncollectible 
medicare home health our medicare billing begins with a process to ensure that our billings are accurate through the utilization of an electronic medicare claim review 
we submit a rap for of our estimated payment for the initial episode at the start of care or of the estimated payment for any subsequent episodes of care contiguous with the first episode for a particular patient 
the full amount of the episode is billed after the episode has been completed final billed 
the rap received for that particular episode is then deducted from our final payment 
if a final bill is not submitted within the greater of days from the start of the episode  or days from the date the rap was paid  any raps received for that episode will be recouped by medicare from any other claims in process for that particular provider number 
the rap and final claim must then be re submitted

index to financial statements medicare hospice for our hospice patients  our pre billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from medicare for the services that we provide to our patients 
once each patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will bill medicare on a monthly basis for the services provided to the patient 
non medicare home health and hospice for our non medicare patients  our pre billing process primarily begins with verifying a patient s eligibility for services with the applicable payor 
once the patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will provide services to the patient and bill the applicable payor based on either the contracted rates or expected payment rates  which are based on our historical experience 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of the receivables to the amounts we estimate will be ultimately collected 
our review and evaluation of non medicare accounts includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or groups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk 
where such groups have been identified  we have given special consideration to both the billing methodology and evaluation of the ultimate collectibility of the accounts 
in addition  the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in payment and an evaluation of collectibility based upon the date that the service was provided 
based upon our best judgment  we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected due to credit risk 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability 
while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units 
we completed our annual impairment review as of october  and determined that no impairment charge was required 
depending on changes in medicare payment  admissions volume and other factors  we may be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
as of december   there were no indicators noted that required us to re evaluate our annual impairment test 
intangible assets consist of certificates of need  licenses  acquired names  non compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights 
we amortize non compete agreements  acquired names that we do not intend to use in the future and reacquired franchise rights on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which is generally three years for non compete agreements and up to five years for reacquired franchise rights and acquired names 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation 
table of contents 
index to financial statements allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december  and  our net deferred tax liabilities were million and million  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was primarily related to an increase of million to the deferred tax liability related to amortization of intangible assets 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  to amend the fasb accounting standards codification to require the disclosure of transfers in and out of level and fair value measurements  a gross presentation of activity within the level fair value measurement roll forward and includes clarifications to existing disclosures requirements on the level of disaggregation and disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques 
the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the level roll forward which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
our revolving credit facility and term loan carry a floating interest rate which is tied to the eurodollar rate ie libor and the prime rate and therefore  our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately million annually
