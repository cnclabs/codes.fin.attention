acquisition of nortel metro ethernet networks business the men acquisition on march   we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the optical networking and carrier ethernet assets of nortel s metro ethernet networks business the men business 
in accordance with the agreements for the acquisition  the million aggregate purchase price was subsequently adjusted downward by million based upon the amount of net working capital transferred to us at closing 
see issuance of convertible notes during fiscal below for information relating to our election to pay the aggregate purchase price in cash 
as a result  we paid million in cash for the purchase of the men business 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an agreement with nortel to lease the lab building on nortel s carling campus in ottawa  canada the carling lease for a term of ten years 
the lease agreement contained a provision that allowed nortel to reduce the term of the lease  and in exchange  we would receive a payment of up to million 
this amount was placed into escrow by nortel in accordance with the acquisition agreements 
the fair value of this contingent refund right was determined by ciena to be million and was recorded as a reduction to the consideration paid  resulting in a purchase price of million 
see item of part i of this report for more information regarding the terms of the carling lease and nortel s recent announcement regarding the exercise of its early termination feature under the carling lease  which resulted in a non cash  unrealized gain of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal rationale for men acquisition the men business that we acquired is a leading provider of next generation  communications network equipment  with a significant global installed base and a strong technology heritage 
the men business is a leader in high capacity g and g coherent optical transport technology that enables network operators to seamlessly upgrade their existing g and g networks  thereby enabling a significant increase in network capacity without the need for new fiber deployments or complex re engineering 
the product and technology assets that we acquired include nortel s long haul optical transport portfolio  metro optical ethernet switching and transport solutions  ethernet transport  aggregation and switching technology  multiservice sonet sdh product families  and network management software products 
in addition to these hardware and software solutions  we also acquired the network implementation and support service resources related to the men business 
we believe that the men acquisition represents a transformative opportunity for ciena 
we believe that this transaction strengthens our position as a leader in next generation  converged optical ethernet networking and will accelerate the execution of our corporate and research and development strategies set forth in item business in part i of this annual report 
we believe that the additional geographic reach  expanded customer relationships  and broader portfolio of complementary network solutions derived from the men business allow us to better compete with traditional  larger network equipment vendors 
as a result of the men acquisition  we added approximately  employees  including significant additional engineering talent  which nearly doubled our headcount 
we expect that the resulting increased scale to our business will enable additional operating leverage and provide an opportunity to optimize our research and development investment toward next generation technologies and product platforms 

table of contents integration activities and costs we continue to make progress on integration related activities in connection with the men acquisition 
we have completed our organizational structure  sales coverage plans  and decisions regarding the rationalization of our combined product portfolio 
as described in restructuring activities below  we have also realized initial operating synergies from the men acquisition 
significant and complex additional integration efforts remain  including the rationalization of our supply chain  third party manufacturers and facilities  the execution of our combined product and software development plan  and our reduced reliance upon and winding down of transition services currently being provided by an affiliate of nortel 
given the relative size of the men business and the structure of the men acquisition as an asset carve out from nortel  the integration of the men business has been costly and complex 
as of october   we have incurred million in transaction  consulting and third party service fees  million in severance expense  and an additional million  primarily related to purchases of capitalized information technology equipment 
we have also incurred inventory obsolescence charges and may incur additional expenses related to  among other things  facilities restructuring 
we anticipate that we will incur approximately million in additional integration costs during fiscal any material delays or difficulties in integrating the men business or additional  unanticipated expense may harm our business and results of operations 
in addition to the integration costs above  we incurred significant transition services expense during fiscal  and expect to continue to incur significant expense into the second quarter of fiscal transition service costs are reflected as a component of operating expense  principally general and administrative expense  and cost of goods sold 
we are currently relying upon an affiliate of nortel to perform certain critical operational and business support functions during an interim integration period that will continue until we can perform these services ourselves or locate another provider 
these support services include key finance and accounting functions  supply chain and logistics management  maintenance and product support services  order management and fulfillment  trade compliance  and information technology services 
these services are estimated to cost approximately million per year  were we to utilize all of the transition services for a full year 
the actual transition service expense will depend upon the scope of the services that ciena utilizes and the time within which we are able to complete the planned transfer of these services to internal resources or other providers 
we have also incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs as we build up internal resources  including headcount  facilities and information systems  or engage alternate third party providers  while we simultaneously rely upon and transition away from these transition support services 
the wind down and transfer of critical transition services  which we expect to complete in the second quarter of fiscal  is a complex undertaking that presents a number of operational risks that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
effect of men acquisition upon results of operations and financial condition due to the relative scale of its operations  the men acquisition has materially affected our operations  financial results and liquidity 
our revenue and operating expense have increased materially compared to periods prior to the men acquisition 
as a result of the men acquisition  we recorded million in other intangible assets that will be amortized over their useful lives and increase our operating expense 
see critical accounting policies and estimates long lived assets below for information relating to these items 
under acquisition accounting rules  we revalued the acquired finished goods inventory of the men business to fair value upon closing 
this revaluation increased marketable inventory carrying value by approximately million  of which million was recognized in cost of goods sold during fiscal  adversely affecting our gross margin 
see note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this report 
as expected  our liquidity and cash and investment balance were significantly affected by our use of cash to fund the purchase price of the men acquisition and resulting acquisition and integration expense  transition service expense and investments to support working capital related to the increased scale of our business 
in addition  our private placements of convertible notes during fiscal resulted in additional indebtedness 
see liquidity and capital resources below and note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this report for more information regarding our convertible notes 
these and other effects on our financial statements described below and elsewhere in this report may make period to period comparisons difficult 
restructuring activities since the men acquisition  we have undertaken a number of restructuring activities 
these actions are intended to reduce operating expense and better align our workforce and operating costs with market opportunities and product development and business strategies following the completion of our men acquisition 
in april  we took action to effect a headcount reduction of approximately employees  with reductions principally affecting our global product group and global field organization outside of the emea region 
this action resulted in a restructuring charge of million in fiscal in may  we announced our reorganization of portions of our business and operations in the emea region 
this action resulted in a restructuring charge of million related to the reduction in head count of approximately employees principally in our global field and supply chain organizations 
as we look to manage operating expense and complete integration activities for the combined operations  we will continue to assess the allocation of our headcount and other resources toward key growth opportunities for our business and evaluate additional cost reduction measures 

table of contents issuance of convertible notes during fiscal on march   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due march  the net proceeds from the offering were million after deducting the placement agents fees and other fees and expenses 
we used million of the net proceeds to replace the contractual obligation to issue convertible notes to nortel as part of the purchase price for the men acquisition 
the remaining proceeds were used to reduce the cash on hand required to fund the aggregate purchase price of the men acquisition 
on october   we completed a private placement million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due october  the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting the placement agents fees and other fees and expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase in privately negotiated transactions approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due may  we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment at maturity or further repurchase  from time to time  of a portion of our outstanding convertible senior notes due may  see note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this report for more information regarding our outstanding convertible notes 
global market conditions and competitive landscape we continue to experience cautious customer behavior with respect to spending as a result of the sustained period of economic weakness and macroeconomic uncertainty 
broad economic weakness has previously resulted in periods of decreased demand for our products and services that have adversely affected our results of operations 
we remain uncertain as to how long current macroeconomic and industry conditions will persist  the pace of recovery  and the magnitude of the effect of these market conditions on our business and results of operations 
at the same time we are experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions  we have encountered an increasingly competitive marketplace 
competition has intensified  in part  due to our increased market share  technology leadership and global presence resulting from the men acquisition 
following the men acquisition  we have experienced increased customer activity and been afforded increased consideration and opportunities to participate in competition for network builds and upgrades  including in emerging geographies and new markets or applications for our products 
securing these opportunities often requires that we agree to aggressive or less favorable commercial terms and conditions  including financial commitments  that may require collateralized standby letters of credit resulting in an increase in our restricted cash 
competition has also intensified as we and our competitors more aggressively seek to secure market share  particularly in connection with new network build opportunities  and displace incumbent equipment vendors at large carrier customers 
we expect this level of competition to continue and  as larger chinese equipment vendors seek to gain entry into the us market  potentially increase 
despite challenging and competitive market conditions  we believe that a number of important underlying drivers represent significant long term opportunities and growing demand for converged optical ethernet networking solutions in our target markets 
we believe that market trends including the proliferation of mobile web applications  prevalence of video applications and shift of enterprise applications to the cloud or virtualized environments are emblematic of increased use and dependence by consumers and enterprises upon a growing variety of broadband applications and services 
these services will continue to add network traffic and consume available bandwidth  requiring our customers to invest in high capacity  next generation network infrastructures that are more efficient and robust  and better able to handle multiservice traffic and increased transmission rates 
see strategy set forth in item business above in this report for information regarding our strategy and plan to capitalize on these market dynamics

results of operations our results of operations for the periods in fiscal reflect the operations of the men business beginning on the march  acquisition date 
we reorganized our internal organizational structure and the management of our business upon the men acquisition  and as described in note of the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this report  present our results of operations based upon the following operating segments packet optical transport includes optical transport solutions that increase network capacity and enable more rapid delivery of a broader mix of high bandwidth services 
these products are used by network operators to facilitate the cost effective and efficient transport of voice  video and data traffic in core networks  as well as regional  metro and access networks 
our principal products in this segment include the activflex packet optical platform activflex  activflex multiservice optical platform activflex  activspan activspan  activspan common photonic layer cpl  optical multiservice edge series ome  and optical metro om from the men business 
this segment includes sales of our activspan flexselect advanced services platform activspan and our corestream agility optical transport system corestream from ciena s pre acquisition portfolio

the addition of men business revenue reflects million of sales relating to activflex  largely driven by service provider demand for high capacity  coherent transport  in support of g and g network infrastructures 
packet optical transport revenue also benefited from the addition of sales from the men business of million of activspan  million of cpl  million of om  million of legacy and other transport products and million of activflex packet optical transport revenue benefited from a million increase in activspan revenue during fiscal  largely driven by metro network builds and latency sensitive applications 
these increases were offset by an million decrease in corestream sales and a million decrease in sales of legacy and other packet optical transport products 
packet optical switching revenue decreased reflecting a million decline in coredirector revenue 
packet optical switching revenue principally reflects our coredirector platform  which has a concentrated customer base 
as a result  revenue can fluctuate considerably depending upon individual customer purchasing decisions 
we believe packet optical switching product revenue was also adversely affected in fiscal by deferred customer purchasing decisions and the effect of carrier sales cycles as we effect a platform transition from coredirector to our next generation  high capacity activflex family of reconfigurable switching systems 
carrier ethernet service delivery revenue increased significantly  reflecting an million increase in sales of our activedge service delivery switches and activedge service aggregation switches in support of wireless backhaul deployments 
quarterly revenue for these products remains subject to fluctuation due to customer concentration and customer buying cycles 
carrier ethernet service delivery revenue also benefitted from the addition of million in sales of our mers product from the men business and an million increase in cnx sales in support of residential dsl 
software and services revenue increased primarily due to the addition of million in maintenance support revenue and million in installation and deployment services from the men business 
segment revenue also benefited from a million increase in maintenance support revenue from ciena s pre acquisition portfolio and a million increase in software revenue 

table of contents revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states is reflected as international in the geographic distribution of revenue below 
the table below in thousands  except percentage data sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year increase decrease united states international total denotes of total revenue denotes change from to united states revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in sales of packet optical transport products  principally as a result of the men acquisition  a million increase in sales of carrier ethernet service delivery products  and a million increase in services revenue 
these increases offset a million decrease in packet optical switching revenue 
international revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in packet optical transport revenue  principally as a result of the men acquisition  a million increase in services revenue and a million increase in sales of carrier ethernet service delivery products 
these increases offset a million decrease in packet optical switching revenue 
while our concentration in revenue has lessened somewhat as a result of the men acquisition  a sizable portion of our revenue continues to come from sales to a small number of service providers  particularly within our packet optical switching and carrier ethernet service delivery businesses 
as a result  our results are significantly affected by spending levels and the business challenges encountered by our largest customers 
moreover  our contracts do not have terms that obligate these customers to purchase any minimum or specific amounts of equipment or services 
our concentration of revenue can be adversely affected by consolidation activity among our large customers 
in addition  some of our customers are pursuing efforts to outsource the management and operation of their networks  or have indicated a procurement strategy to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase equipment 
in april  we were selected as a domain network equipment supplier by at t for its optical transport network and metro and core transport domains 
being named as a vendor in multiple technology domains under this program affords us an opportunity to forge a more collaborative technology relationship across these product platforms 
sales to at t were million or of our revenue in fiscal and million or of our revenue in fiscal we did not have any other customers accounting for greater than of revenue in fiscal or cost of goods sold and gross profit product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  component costs  employee related costs and overhead  shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing related operations  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  amortization of intangible assets  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third party costs  including employee related costs  associated with our provision of services including installation  deployment  maintenance support  consulting and training activities  and  when applicable  estimated losses on committed customer contracts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  continues to be susceptible to quarterly fluctuation due to a number of factors 
gross margin can vary significantly depending upon the mix and concentration of products  the mix of lower margin common equipment  geographic mix and the mix of customers and services in a given fiscal quarter 
gross margin can also be affected by our introduction of new products  charges for excess and obsolete inventory  changes in warranty costs and sales volume 
gross margin can also be adversely affected by the competitive environment and level of pricing pressure we encounter 
the combination of uncertain market conditions  recent constraints on customer capital expenditures and increased competition has resulted in a heightened customer focus on pricing and return on network investment  as customers address network traffic growth and strive to increase revenue and profit 
our exposure to pricing pressure has been most severe in metro and core applications for our packet optical transport platforms  which we expect will comprise a greater percentage of our overall revenue as a result of the men acquisition 
as a result  and in an effort to retain or secure customers  enter new markets or capture market share  in the past we have and in the future we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that result in lower or negative gross margins on a particular order or group of orders 
these arrangements would adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations 
we expect that gross margins will also be subject to fluctuation based on our level of success in driving cost reductions and rationalizing our supply chain and third party contract manufacturers as part of the men acquisition integration activities

gross profit on products as a percentage of product revenue decreased due to a number of items relating to the men acquisition that increased costs of goods sold during fiscal these items include the revaluation of inventory described in overview above  excess purchase commitment losses on ciena s pre acquisition inventory relating to product rationalization decisions  and increased amortization of intangible assets 
fiscal gross profit was also adversely affected by a lower concentration of packet optical switching revenue 
these additional costs were offset by lower warranty and excess and obsolete inventory charges as compared to fiscal gross margin for fiscal was negatively affected by a million charge related to two committed customer sales contracts that resulted in a negative gross margin on the initial phases of the customers deployment 
gross profit on services as a percentage of services revenue increased due to higher concentration of maintenance support and professional services as a percentage of revenue  and improved operational efficiencies

acquisition and integration costs are related to the men acquisition 
as of october   we have incurred million in transaction  consulting and third party service fees 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional expense relating to acquisition and integration activities in fiscal  a significant portion of which will be recognized as operating expense 
amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisition of additional intangible assets as a result of the men acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
restructuring costs for fiscal primarily reflect the headcount reductions and restructuring activities described in the overview restructuring activities above 
goodwill impairment costs reflect the impairment of goodwill and resulting charge incurred in fiscal as described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
change in fair value of contingent consideration is related to the contingent refund right we received relating to the carling lease entered into as part of the men acquisition 
as a result of a change in circumstances and outcome probabilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million change in fair value

interest expense increased due to our private placements during fiscal of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due march  and million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due october  see note to the consolidated financial statements found under item of part ii of this report 
loss on cost method investments during fiscal was due to the decline in value of our investments in two privately held technology companies that were determined to be other than temporary 
gain on extinguishment of debt for fiscal resulted from our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions for million 
we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of million  which consists of the million gain from the repurchase of the notes  less million of associated debt issuance costs 
provision benefit for income taxes increased primarily due to a decrease in refundable federal tax credits 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue revenue for fiscal reflects the weakness  volatility and uncertainty presented by the global market conditions that we encountered during the year 
our fiscal revenue reflects cautious spending  primarily among our largest service provider customers  as they sought to conserve capital  reduce debt or address uncertainties or changes in their own business models brought on by broader market challenges

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  derivatives and hedging  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
table of contents that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
we apply the percentage of completion method to long term arrangements where we are required to undertake significant production customizations or modification engineering  and reasonable and reliable estimates of revenue and cost are available 
utilizing the percentage of completion method  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred 
in instances that do not meet the percentage of completion method criteria  and recognition of revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
if circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenue  costs  or extent of progress toward completion  revisions to the estimates are made 
these revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenue or costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by management 
some of our communications networking equipment is integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and software 
if multiple element arrangements include software or software related elements that are essential to the equipment  we allocate the arrangement fee to those separate units of accounting 
multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered element s is not dependent on the undelivered element s  there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element s  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element s have been met 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for all other deliverables  we separate the elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element s  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially within our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element s 
the revenue recognition criteria described above are applied to each separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and net intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the application of the purchase method of accounting 
table of contents for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill 
these assumptions and estimates include a market participant s use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and  when appropriate  includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
during fiscal  we completed the men acquisition for a purchase price of million 
as a result of the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as contingent consideration  there was no value assigned to goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
we calculate the expected term using detailed historical information about specific exercise behavior of our grantees 
we considered the implied volatility and historical volatility of our stock price in determining our expected volatility  and  finding both to be equally reliable  determined that a combination of both measures would result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
we recognize the estimated fair value of option based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of october   total unrecognized compensation expense was million i million  which relates to unvested stock options and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of year  and ii million  which relates to unvested restricted stock units and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock units directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law with and without method 
under the with and without method  the windfall is considered realized and recognized for financial statement purposes only when an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax benefits including our net operating losses 
the with and without method results in the windfall from share based compensation awards always being effectively the last tax benefit to be considered 
consequently  the windfall attributable to share based compensation will not be considered realized in instances where our net operating loss carryover that is unrelated to windfalls is sufficient to offset the current year s taxable income before considering the effects of current year windfalls 

table of contents reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  these charges were primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted product sales 
for fiscal  these charges were primarily related to excess and obsolete inventory charges relating to product rationalization decisions in connection with the men acquisition 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
if actual market conditions worsen or differ from those we have assumed  if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there is a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to a rapid change in technology  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
our inventory net of allowance for excess and obsolescence was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the fair value of the minimum future lease payments under our contracted lease obligations  offset by the fair value of the estimated sublease payments that we may receive 
as of october   our accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
the total minimum remaining lease payments for these restructured facilities are million 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of our leases  which range from five months to eight years 
if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we will be required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management s assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectibility 
in doing so  we consider creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer s financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of october  and october  was million 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  which we have determined to be the last business day of fiscal september each year 
we also test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
prior to the reorganization of our operations described in overview above  we tested goodwill for impairment as a single reporting unit 
see interim impairment assessment fiscal below 
the first step in the process of assessing goodwill impairment is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
if we are required to take a substantial impairment charge  our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period 
as of the end of fiscal and  our goodwill balance was 
table of contents interim impairment assessment fiscal based on a combination of factors  including the then current macroeconomic conditions  a sustained decline in our common stock price and market capitalization below our net book value  we conducted an interim impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal we determined the fair value of our then single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization was determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our common stock over a day period before and a day period after each assessment date 
we used this day duration to consider inherent market fluctuations that may have affected any individual closing price 
we believed that our market capitalization alone did not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we added a control premium which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions related to our company to our market capitalization 
when we performed the step one fair value comparison during the second quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization was million and our carrying value  including goodwill  was million 
we applied a control premium to market capitalization to determine a fair value of million 
because step one indicated that the fair value was less than our carrying value  we performed the step two analysis 
under the step two analysis  the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of a reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill was determined to be  and  as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million in fiscal  representing the full carrying value of the goodwill 
long lived assets our long lived assets include equipment  furniture and fixtures  finite lived intangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets  and maintenance spares 
as of october  and these assets totaled million and million  net  respectively 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
our long lived assets are assigned to asset groups which represents the lowest level for which we identify cash flows 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting essentially all our net deferred tax assets of billion 
when measuring the need for a valuation allowance  we assess both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent three year period is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our cumulative loss during this three year period represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for nearly a full valuation allowance 
we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
any future release of valuation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income or as an adjustment to paid in capital  based on tax ordering requirements 
uncertain tax positions we account for uncertainty in income tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as of october   we had million and million recorded as current and long term obligations  respectively  related to uncertain tax positions 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 

table of contents the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by million during fiscal to million  which includes million of interest and some minor penalties 
on march   as a result of the acquisition of the men business  ciena recorded a liability and an indemnification asset of million related to the uncertain income tax positions of the men business 
during the second quarter of fiscal  subsequent to the acquisition  this acquired liability and associated indemnification asset were reduced by million due to a lapse in applicable statute of limitations 
warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million and million as of october  and  respectively 
our products are generally covered by a hardware warranty for periods ranging from one to five years and a software warranty of days or one year  depending upon the product 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying these warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business 
these may relate to disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
a loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
unaudited quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  and reflect the impact of our march  acquisition of the men business

there were no material  retroactive measurement period adjustments related to the men acquisition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
as of october  we no longer hold any marketable debt securities 
accordingly  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percentage points from current levels  the fair value of the portfolio would not be affected 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  our business and results of operations are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  our sales have primarily been denominated in us dollars and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material 
as a result of our increased global presence  in large part resulting from the men acquisition  a larger percentage of our revenue is non us dollar denominated  in particular  with sales denominated in canadian dollars and euros 
as a result  if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  our revenues could be adversely affected 
for our us dollar denominated sales  an increase in the value of the us dollar would increase the real cost to our customers of our products in markets outside the united states 
with regard to operating expense  our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in canadian dollars  british pounds  euros and indian rupees 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense was non us dollar denominated 
if these currencies strengthen  costs reported in us dollars will increase  which would adversely affect our operating expense 
to reduce variability in non us dollar denominated operating expense  we have previously entered into foreign currency forward contracts and may do so in the future 
in the past  these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes 
as of october   we did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
for fiscal  research and development expense was negatively affected by approximately million due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates related to the weakening of the us dollar in relation to the canadian dollar  partially offset by the favorable impact of a stronger us dollar in relation to the euro 
sales and marketing expense benefited by million due to the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the euro 
as of october   the assets and liabilities of our entities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
we may experience gains or losses from the revaluation of these foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the net gain loss on foreign currency revaluation during fiscal was immaterial 
convertible debt outstanding 
the fair market value of each of our outstanding issues of convertible notes is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes and other factors 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the notes may also increase as the market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price of the stock falls 
interest rate and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes  and may affect the prices at which we would be able repurchase such notes were we to do so 
these changes do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
during fiscal  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes due in privately negotiated transactions for cash payments of million 
during fiscal  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes due may  in open market transactions for million 
for additional information on the fair value of our outstanding notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report
